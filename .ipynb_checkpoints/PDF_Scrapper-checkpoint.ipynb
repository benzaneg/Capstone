       "['1AMERICAN MACROECONOMICGROWTH IN THE ERA OFKNOWLEDGE-BASED PROGRESS:THE LONG-RUN PERSPECTIVEMOSES ABRAMOVITZ AND PAUL A. DAVIDOVERVIEW AND ORGANIZATION OFTHE CHAPTERThis chapter focuses on the nature of the macroeconomic growth processthat has characterized the United States experience, and manifesteditself in the changing pace and sources of the rise of real output per capitain the U.S. economy during the past two hundred years. Our main inter-est is, indeed, in the twentieth century, but we believe that its major char-acteristics and the nature of the underlying forces at work are most clearlyseen in comparisons between the century just past and the one that camebefore.A key observation that emerges from the long-term quantitative eco-nomic record is that the proximate sources of increases in real gross domes-tic product per capita in the century between 1889 and 1989 were quitedifferent from those which obtained during the first one hundred years ofthe American national experience. Baldly put, the national ecomomymoved from an extensive to an increasingly intensive mode of growth, andits development at the intensive margin has become more and more depen-dent upon the acquisition and exploitation of technological and organiza-tional knowledge.Our first objective, therefore, must be to assemble and describe the com-ponents of the U.S. macroeconomic record in some quantitative detail, ina manner that exposes the nature and dimensions of the contrast betweenthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We approach this task within thewell-established framework of \"growth accounting.\" This enables us toshow the secular acceleration that occurred in the growth rate of total',\n",
       " '2 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. Davidfactor productivity, which is the weighted average of the productivities ofcapital and labor, and the growth in the importance of total factor pro-\\nductivity as a source of labor productivity and per capita output increases.Further, by taking account of changes in the quality of the productive\\ninputs, we arrive at \"refined\" measures of total factor productivity growth,which highlight two contrasts between the eras preceding and followingthe transitional decades, 1879Š1909.The first of these is the enlargement of that element in the long-termgrowth rate of labor productivity that remains unexplained by the factorinputs we can measure and thus is associated, but not identical, withadvances in technological knowledge Š including the knowledge per-mitting realization of economies of large scale production. The second\\nmajor contrast between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is the\\ndiminished relative importance of conventional tangible capital accumu-\\nlation in the twentieth century and the rising role of intangible capital\\nformation through investments in education and training, on the one\\nhand, and the organized investment in research and development (R&D)on the other.After the turn into the twentieth century, the substitution of fixedcapital for labor was governed by conflicting forces. It was strengthened\\nfor many decades by slower growth of labor supply and a concomitant ten-\\ndency for wages to rise more substantially than they would otherwise have\\ndone. These developments stemmed in part from demographic changes,including the immigration restrictions following World War I, in partfrom the downward trend in hours of work and in part from the length-\\nening years of education. At the same time, there were also important new\\nopportunities to reduce costs by developing methods of intensifying the\\nutilization of fixed facilities.This was a strategy that was first implemented in the late nineteenthand early twentieth century by consolidation of railroads, by the techno-\\nlogical innovations designed to increase train speeds and power utiliza-\\ntion, and by the growth of continuous process industries, notablypetroleum extraction, transport, and refining, and its extension to petro-chemicals. Its roots also can be found, as Alfred Chandler, Jr. has pointed\\nout, in the high throughput manufacturing regimes that appeared after1870 when production and direct-selling by manufacturers were extendedto serve increasingly wide markets.The challenges of operating greatly enlarged technological and com-mercial systems on a continental scale contributed to the rising demand',\n",
       " \"Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 3for a more formally educated breed of managers, as well as workers withhigher levels of literacy and numeracy. They also called forth new controltechnologies, which played a role in initiating the pioneering U.S.advances in communications and information technologies, beginning\\nwith the telegraph system's close relationship to railroad operations in the\\nmid-nineteenth century, and leading on to the development of the tele-phone system, and the computer systems of the twentieth century.Thus, however distinct and different was the new technological spiritof the twentieth century, we may see that the way in which a succession\\nof general-purpose technologies came to be elaborated and implementedin the United States during the twentieth century Š how electricity,telecommunications, the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine,and, most recently, the digital computer have reflected the interplay ofglobal developments that were expressed, first and most fully, in Ameri-can circumstances, and so took forms that owed much to the particular\\nlegacy of America's nineteenth-century development.Our second purpose, therefore, is to advance an interpretation of theforces underlying the ascent of the U.S. economy to its internationally\\ndominant position in the twentieth century, and to account for the trans-\\nformations that have occurred in the relationships among the proximate\\nsources of America's macroeconomic growth. The principal elements of our\\ninterpretation can be identified under two headings. First are those forces\\nthat can best be regarded as generic, global tendencies, linked to interna-tionally shared advances in science and technology broadly construed. Theemergence of new and greater potentiality for knowledge-based economic\\ndevelopment during the twentieth century, and the working out of its\\nimplications for production methods and the endogenous growth of pro-ductive resources in the context of the United States, is thus to be under-stood not as a unique, national phenomenon. Rather, these form part of amuch broader set of tendencies, far more global in their ultimate mani-\\nfestations, which took an early and particularistic form in the American\\nsetting.We read the available evidence as indicating that the overall bias ofinnovation during the nineteenth century was strongest in the directionof labor-saving changes; that the latter were not only relatively more pro-nounced than the tendency towards natural resource-saving, but weremarkedly stronger than the impacts on use relative to usage of tangible\\nreproducible capital-inputs. Indeed, we contend that technological pro-gress in the nineteenth century was characterized by an absolute capital-\",\n",
       " '4 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. Davidusing bias.1 By contrast, from the experience of the U.S. macroeconomy itappears that the twentieth century has been characterized by a bias towardsinnovation of an intangible capital-using kind, and the emergence oftangible capital-saving technical change alongside ordinary labor-savinginnovation Š albeit with a bias in favor of the latter that represents a con-tinuation of what had been experienced in the preceding century.Among the second broad category of forces are some that may be heldto constitute more specifically American national characteristics, condi-\\ntions which at the opening of the present century properly could beviewed, and were cited by contemporaries as responsible for the differencesthey perceived between the ways that production and distribution wereorganized and conducted in the U.S., compared with the economic prac-tices prevalent in the Old World. Some of these had their roots in the tra-jectories of resource exploitation and technological adaptations that wereestablished previously, during the extensive developmental phase of thepreceding era. Others certainly reflected features of the socio-economicstructure, political institutions, and cultural ethos that were peculiar to or\\nmost prominently displayed by the young society that had taken shape inthis region of recent European settlement. The ways in which the tech-\\nnologically driven demand-side forces in the factor markets elicited thesupply-side responses necessary for the formation of new, and non-\\nconventional, stocks of intangible capital, and the specific demographic\\nand institutional developments that also contributed to shifting factor\\nsupply conditions to account for the salient features distinguishing theU.S. growth path in the twentieth century from the preceding course ofmacroeconomic development. Nevertheless, in the continuing accumula-\\ntion of capital at a pace which has exceeded the rate of growth of output,\\nthe long-run dynamics of the contemporary economy displays an impor-\\ntant element of continuity with its past experience.Third, we turn from the U.S. growth performance in the twentiethcentury to that of the preceding epoch, and examine the American path of\\ndevelopment in relation to the contemporaneous experiences of the otherindustrial nations. The twentieth century\\'s opening half had witnessed theU.S. ascent to a position of international economic leadership in regard tothe average level of real income enjoyed by members of the population.This, as will be seen, was based upon the early establishment and further\\' Because the associated concepts are central to the interpretation advanced in this chapter, it is impor-tant at the outset that the terms \"factor-saving\" and \"factor-using\" should be understood to bedenned relatively, i.e., in relation to output.',\n",

Consequently, the years immediatelyfollowing World War II found the United States at the pinnacle of com-parative affluence and preponderance in the international economy, a posi-tion that soon began to be eroded by the recovery of other, war-torneconomies, and the emergence of strong tendencies among the industrialeconomies not only to converge in their levels of productivity but to \"catchup\" with the United States, and in some instances to forge ahead. Theseinternational perspectives on the American growth experience are devel-oped more fully later, where we offer a broad account of the key forces thathave worked to alter the economy\\'s relative position on the global stage. A\\nnumber of the important elements that had contributed to the creation of\"American exceptionalism\" in both the material and technological domainssubsequently lost their former significance - having been either trans-\\nformed at home, or come into existence more ubiquitously among the\\nworld\\'s industrially advanced societies in the course of the twentieth\\ncentury. Such developments, especially those that came to fruition in thepost-World War II era, will be seen to help account for the modificationsthat have occurred in the U.S. position of industrial leadership.A STATISTICAL PROFILE OF AMERICANGROWTH SINCE 1800Problems of MeasurementOutput per head of a nation\\'s population, said A. C. Pigou in a classic\\nstudy, is the \"objective, measurable counterpart of [its] economic welfare.\"\\nOutput per head is only part of the content of economic welfare, but it is\\nwith this in mind that we make the growth of per capita output the focus\\nof this chapter. Our purpose here is two-fold: first, to draw a statisticalpicture of American growth and of the proximate elements or sources fromwhich it derived; and, second, to search for the conditions or forces that\\ncontrolled the strength of these elements and their changes. We identifythe proximate sources of growth in the manner of John Stuart Mill:We may say, then, . . . that the requisites of production are Labour, Capital andLand. The increase of production, therefore, depends on the properties of theseelements. It is the result of the increase either of the elements themselves, or oftheir productiveness.\" (Principles of Political Economy, Ashley Edition, 156)',\n",
       " '6 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidWe shall in the end search for the forces that lie behind the increase of the\"elements\" and their \"productiveness.\" But our search is a limited one. Itgoes as far as our own understanding and the length of this chapter allow.We draw attention at this early point, therefore, to the deepest causes ofgrowth that lie in America\\'s attitudes and aspirations, in the institutionsthat govern the operation of the American economic system and in the\\nincentives that support work, capital accumulation, enterprise and theadvance of practical knowledge; but we cannot attempt a systematic\\nexploration of these fundamental conditions. Our first task is simplydescriptive.2The growth with which we can deal with some degree of assurance isthe growth as it appears in the available statistics. The growth rates of\\naggregate and per capita output that appear in the statistics are the growththat can be measured; with few exceptions that means the output thatflows through commercial markets. Such measures are neither compre-\\nhensive nor unbiased. The goods and services that are produced in thehome or on farms but that never reach the market must be included, ifthey can be, on the basis of rough estimates or else neglected entirely. Sig-nificant parts of total output - land clearing and drainage, timber fellingand sawing, barn raising, food preparation and canning, the care of chil-dren, the sick and the aged, the repair of equipment and furniture, the\\nprovision of knowledge and entertainment Š have moved from the house-hold to the market and sometimes back again and so biased measures of\\ngrowth either upward or downward. There are analogous troubles with ourmeasures of the sources of ourput growth. In particular, the contributions\\nof the various sources, which appear in the tables as if they acted on growthindependently of one another, are, in fact, to some unknown but signifi-cant degree the result of the joint action of two or more sources. Perhaps\\nmost important of all, the great advances in the quality and variety ofgoods and services register quite inadequately in our measures of output.Whether bacterial pneumonia is treated with poultices or penicillin makes\\nno difference to our measures of output so long as their unit cost in the\\nbase years of the GDP indexes is the same. And so with communication\\nby pony express, by telegraph, telephone or E-mail. A quality adjusted\\nmeasure of output would on this account rise faster than the existing mea-2 Several chapters in Volume II of The Cambridge Economic History of the United States deal with thesame subjects.

But existing measures also neglect the disamenities and costs ofgrowth, for example the congestion, pollution, noise, and crime of citiesŠ to be balanced, of course, against their cultural wealth, intellectual vigor,and stimulation. No one can say exactly how a truly comprehensivemeasure of growth would look and there is no utterly objective way toprovide one. These real difficulties must be set aside, but not lost to mind.We return to them later. Meanwhile we study the growth of output percapita because it is the only measure of the aggregate of goods and ser-vices available to people on the average over long periods of time.The growth we study in this chapter refers to the long-term or sustainedincrease in national product. This means the growth that persists, not only\\nacross the inevitable year-to-year ups and downs of business activity, but\\nalso across the more extended fluctuations that reverse themselves only\\nover a period of years. In the American economy of the nineteenth and\\nearly twentieth centuries, these fluctuations took two forms. One was the\\nfamiliar \"business cycle,\" which until the 1960s typically had a duration\\nin this country of about five years. When, however, the effects of such busi-\\nness cycles are attenuated by calculating growth rates between the average\\nlevels or peak years of successive cycles, a second wave of longer durationemerges. In the American experience, these \"long swings\" succeeded one\\nanother at intervals of fifteen to twenty-five years from early in the nine-teenth century until about 1930 and, with some differences in mechanism,\\nthereafter as well. To measure the trends of sustained growth properly,\\ntherefore, we must calculate growth rates between similar phases of longswings and choose years to represent those phases that are comparable intheir business-cycle position.There was a remaining element of irregularity. It was especially impor-tant during the long-swing intervals of 1855 to 1871 and 1929 to 1948.The first spans the Civil War and its disturbed aftermath. The second spansthe Great Depression of the 1930s and the intense but war-directed activ-\\nity of World War II. Both were marked by large and anomalous slowdowns\\nin output growth. The Depression of the thirties, which discouraged\\ninvestment, and the war, which imposed restrictions on civilian invest-ment, caused a serious reduction in private capital accumulation and\\nretarded normal productivity growth. The effect of the Civil War was even\\nmore pronounced. The extraordinary upsurges of output, capital accumu-\\nlation, and productivity growth in the periods that followed these warsand depressions were, in part, rebounds based on exploiting backlogs ofpostponed investment and technological innovation and, in the case of the',\n",

Combining the records of the disturbedperiods with the rebounds that followed offers a better view of the under-lying long-term trends of economic advance. Table i. i and similar tablesin the text are designed to do that.Finally, the figures throughout are afflicted by errors of estimation, butwe judge that these are more serious before the Civil War than after. To\\nget a more accurate picture of long-term growth, it seems better, there-fore, to view the pre-Civil War development as a whole. The result is thelong period 1800Š55, which appears in Table 1.1 and in later tables. Wecall the figures in Table 1.1 and in analogous later tables \"Measures Across\\nLong Periods.\"The scope of output on which the chapter focuses attention is the\"private domestic economy.\" This is somewhat smaller than the nationalproduct as a whole in that the former excludes \"government product,\"\\nwhich is the payments made by governments directly to the factors of pro-\\nduction. Essentially that means the compensation of government employ-ees, because the national accounts treat government interest payments, not',\n",
       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 9as factor compensation, but as transfers. In order to produce a total productmade by factors working within the country, the private domestic economyalso excludes net factor incomes from abroad, that is, the excess of incomes\\nearned by the labor and capital of U.S. nationals employed abroad over theincomes earned by foreign nationals and foreign capital situated in theUnited States. Neither item was of significant size in the nineteenthcentury. And while government product has become of much greaterimportance since, the long-term rates of growth of aggregate nationalproduct and private domestic product have remained quite similar.Private domestic product, nevertheless, is a better basis for productiv-ity measurement than is the aggregate national product. That is because\\nthe real, inflation-corrected, product of government is obtained by deflat-ing current dollar wage payments by an index of nominal wages perworker. Real government product, therefore, emerges essentially as ameasure of the growth of government employment. The productivity\\nchange, presumably the increase in productivity, of government workers,\\ndisappears, which introduces a downward bias into measures of the pro-ductivity of national rather than private scope.The first section in each table deals with the nineteenth century, thesecond section with the twentieth. The sources and, to some degree, themethods of estimate of the output figures are somewhat different inthe two frames. The tables, therefore, show figures for overlapping periodsaround the turn of the century on both bases. The figures in the first sectionfor the turn of the century are better for comparisons with earlier years;the figures in the second section for the same period are better for com-parisons with later years.The output figures in Table 1.1 and in most later tables represent grossproduct before allowance for depreciation. Net product after depreciationwould, indeed, be a better measure of output relevant to economic welfare.\\nThe long-term growth rates of net and gross output, however, are not sig-nificantly different, and gross output is a better basis for the measurementof productivity.Output, Population, and Output per CapitaTable 1.1 and Tables 1.2 to 1.4 that follow encapsulate the main features\\nof nearly two centuries of American development as it appears in the paceof measured output growth and its proximate sources. These numbers can\\nbe only the beginning of a search for the forces governing growth, but',\n",
       " 'io Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. Davidthey are a useful beginning, a framework that suggests the quantitativeoutlines of the American experience.When we look at the record across the long periods of Table i. i, itappears that the 18oos were a century of 4 percent growth of aggregateproduct. And this was true whether we look at growth in the nationaleconomy (GNP) or in the private domestic economy (GPDP). Beginningaround the turn of the century, however, the pace began to fall off. Fromthe 4 percent growth of the last century, it has gradually declined until in\\nthe most recent quarter-century it was under 3 percent a year. Both the 4percent rate of the 1800s and the gradual slowdown in the 1900s, however,were the outcome of divergent movements in the components of aggre-gate output growth, that is, population growth and per capita output\\ngrowth.Population growth in the first half of the last century was very rapid.With few reversals it has slowed down ever since. The transient baby boom\\nyears of the 1950s and early 1960s were a notable exception. Per capita\\noutput growth, however, speeded up. It did so in two steps, a large one\\nbetween the first and second halves of the last century, a smaller but still\\nsubstantial one between the second half of the nineteenth century and the\\nfirst quarter of the twentieth. The rate of about 1.8 or 1.9 percent a yearthat was achieved in private domestic product per capita between 1890and 1927 was then roughly maintained, when viewed over suitably longperiods, for the rest of the century. It was, indeed, a remarkably rapid pace.\\nSustained so long, it was enough to make the measured level of private\\noutput per head nearly six times as high in 1990 as it had been a century\\nearlier.With population growth declining, the big step-up of per capita growthduring the last century was enough to sustain the pace of growth of theaggregate in the 1800s. With population growth declining still faster inthe 1900s, the smaller step-up in per capita growth across the turn of the\\ncentury, a fortiori its stability since that time, was not. So aggregate outputgrowth measured over long periods, has declined steadily since the begin-ning of the present century.This is the big picture. Within the long periods of Table 1.1, however,\\neconomic growth suffered fluctuations that deserve notice. The moreimportant of these emerge in the measures across long-swing intervals. Forexample, the private per capita growth rate in the cross-Civil War inter-val (1855-71) fell to a pace approaching zero, while in the 1870s and',\n",
       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 111880s, during the rebound from the war, the growth rate was higherthan in any similar interval before or since. There then followed a slow-down, the seriousness of which is perhaps muted by the timing of long-swing intervals. The impact of the Great Depression and World War II,taken together, however, emerges clearly; and so does the rebound thatfollowed.If we look beyond the simple arithmetic of Table 1.1, it is clear thatoutput per capita and population growth interact. The outcome has turned\\non a balance of offsetting influences. On the one side, powerful influencesconnected with the rise of per capita product and productivity and, moreespecially with the technological progress behind it, made for a decline inmortality. The migration to the cities, however, where death rates were rel-\\natively high, at first tended to raise mortality. Beginning around 1870, a\\nmovement to improve sanitation, together with a gradual betterment ofnutrition, served to curb disease and morbidity generally. Still more impor-tant, the advance of knowledge that supports productivity growth includedthe germ theory of disease. It persuaded people to accept the expensive proj-ects needed to bring clean water to the growing cities and to remove theirwastes. Building on the anti-bacterial work of Robert Koch and LouisPasteur in the 1870s and 1880s, growing knowledge also led to the greet\\nreductions of small pox, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and measles made possi-ble by vaccination and the inoculation of anti-toxins. Later in the twenti-\\neth century came the dramatic improvements in the cure of infections with\\nantibiotics. Increasing knowledge also brought valuable ways of detecting\\nand treating cancers and avoiding and curing cardiac disease.3High and rising levels of income and, mainly in the nineteenth century,cheap land attracted immigrants. And a large flow of immigrants did,indeed, account for a considerable part of the total increase of populationfrom early in the nineteenth century to World War I. From the 1840s\\nuntil World War I, approximately a quarter of the growth rate of totalpopulation was attributable directly to immigration. The children ofimmigrants added still more. Between the early 1920s and about 1970,\\nthe flow of immigrants, restricted by federal legislation, was much lessimportant. It made up only some 11 percent of the rate of populationgrowth. In the last 25 years, however, migration, legal and illegal, hasagain risen in importance.3 See Richard Easterlin, chap. 9 in this volume. See also Easterlin, \"Industrial Revolution and Mor-tality Revolution: Two of a Kind?\" Evolutionary Economics, 5 (1995), 393Š408, and Michael R.Haines, chap. 4 in vol. II of this series.',\n",
       " '12 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidIt is the birth rate, however, that has been most weighty in governingchanges in the growth of population. It is true that rising levels of income,taken by themselves, make it easier for young people to marry early and\\nto raise large families. Other circumstances accompanying income growth\\nitself have, nevertheless, worked in the opposite direction and produced\\nthe long-term trend toward lower birth rates and a decline in the rate ofpopulation growth. In the nineteenth century, the intensification of set-tlement gradually raised the price of land and made it difficult to estab-\\nlish numerous children on nearby farms. Industrialization attracted people\\nto the cities where the costs of space were higher and where children were\\nless well able to contribute to family income. It also weakened the eco-\\nnomic bonds between generations that family farms and other family busi-\\nnesses create. So it reduced the economic security that children offered toparents and in that way undercut the attractions of a large family. Itenlarged the opportunities of women for paid work outside the home and\\nso raised the costs of devoting effort and attention to family. Remunera-tive and attractive employment in this century came to depend increas-\\ningly on higher levels and longer years of education, which again raised\\nthe costs of bringing children to adulthood. The technical progress onwhich, as we shall see, per capita output growth largely rests, included\\nprogress in the means of contraception. And the spread of education helpedto diffuse knowledge of contraceptive techniques and made people more\\nready to use them. In sum - the decline in population growth and thus\\nin aggregate output growth stemmed in large part from the rising level\\nof per capita output, or, better, from the forces that support it and the con-ditions of life that go with it.4There are also reverse influences that run from population growth to therise of per capita output. An increase in population, if it presses on scarce\\nresources, tends to reduce output per capita. In the conditions of land and\\nresource abundance characteristic of the United States, however, the chiefeffect of population growth has been to raise the level of aggregate outputby its effect, subject to a lag, on the growth of the labor supply. By itseffect on the size of the domestic market it opened the way to a larger\\nexploitation of the economies of large-scale production and so to higher\\noutput per capita as well. In these circumstances, the declining rate of pop-ulation growth in the present century would have acted to limit the poten-4 Easterlin, chap. 9 in this volume, and his \"The American Population\" in Lance E.

The twentieth century\\'s declining populationgrowth rates may, therefore, have been a constraint on aggregate\\noutput growth, not only because they tended to reduce the growth rate ofthe labor force but also because they held back the growth of labor pro-ductivity. But labor productivity rose for other reasons, and these muststill be explored. We turn first, however, to review the course of labor\\ninput.The Changing Contribution of Labor Input per CapitaPer capita output growth may be viewed as the sum of the growth ratesof the annual number of hours of work per year per head of the popula-tion and of output per hour.During the nineteenth century, per capita labor input rose at a ratesomewhat under one-half percent a year (Table 1.2). This seemingly\\nmodest pace, however, amounted to more than 50 percent of the still low\\ngrowth rate of per capita output in the first half of that century. But evenin the second half, when per capita output growth had risen toward ratesmore familiar now, about a quarter of the advance was still derived fromthe growth of labor input per head.In the twentieth century, by contrast, things were quite different. Theinput of labor hours began to decline on a per capita basis and did so atan accelerating pace. Given the high and steady rate of per capita outputgrowth, this implies that long-term labor productivity growth was accel-erating, at least through the first three quarters of the century\\n(1890Š1966). And then there was a reversal. During the quarter-centurysince 1966, the growth of per capita labor input jumped again to thehigher rates characteristic of the nineteenth century, while laborproductivity growth fell back to a slow pace not seen since the turn ofthe century, perhaps earlier. The two developments were, to some degree,\\nconnected.The growth of labor hours per capita can itself be decomposed, and thisis done in Table 1.3. Here the growth of labor hours per head is viewedas the sum of the growth rates of the labor force per head of the popula-tion, of full-time equivalent persons at work (\"persons engaged\") per\\nmember of the labor force, and of hours of work per person engaged.

       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 15The strong growth of per capita labor input during the nineteenthcentury was due in part to the first of these components, that is to thefaster growth of the labor force than of population. This is traceable partlyto the effect of immigration, which brought in more people of workingage than it did children, women, and old dependents, and partly to themanner in which population growth declined. Because birth rates fell\\nfaster than death rates, the proportion of dependent children and youth\\ndeclined relative to adult groups, and the population of working age rose\\ncompared with the general population.The growth of labor input, especially in the first half of the nineteenthcentury, was bolstered as well by increases in the ratios of employment tolabor force and of hours per person employed. Both developments wereconnected with the shift of population and employment from farming andrural life to the towns and cities and to employment in the growing non-farm sectors. Urban life gave women a better chance for paid (and, there-fore, recorded) employment outside the home. And full-time annual hoursof work on the farms, because of its seasonal nature, were only some 75percent as much as annual hours in the non-farm sector.5As one moves into the twentieth century, the balance offerees changed,producing first a slow, then a very rapid decline in labor input per head,\\nwhich continued into the 1960s. Both long-term and transitory factors\\nwere at work. In the first third of the century, from about 1890 through1929, the same balance of demographic developments, the relative growthof the population of working age, reflecting the decline of birth rates and,therefore, of dependent children, and until World War I, the continued\\nflow of immigrants in large numbers produced a continuing rise in the\\nimportance of the working-age population and in the ratio of labor force\\nto population. This was more than offset, however, by a more rapid drop\\nin non-farm hours of work. The hours decline took place especially rapidlyduring World War I when workers took advantage of tight labor markets\\nto gain shorter hours without a drop in pay. By 1919, this drop in averagenon-farm hours, together with a smaller rise in average annual farm hours,had made annual hours per worker in the two sectors about equal. The\\nfarm-non-farm shift no longer worked to support the growth of labor\\ninput.Apart from these long-term developments, an important feature of theyears since 1929 was a large and protracted fluctuation in labor input per\\' John W. Kendcick, Productivity Trends in the United States (Princeton, 1961), Table A-IX, and PaulA. David, \"Real Income and Economic Welfare Growth in the Early Republic\" (1996).',\n",

The decline, which had begun in the early part of the century, accel-erated between 1929 and 1966 and proceeded at a multiple of its earlierpace.6 And then it turned around; for the last quarter century, it has beenrising almost as fast as it fell during the preceding four decades. Withoutthe decline of labor input per capita in the middle decades of the century,\\nthe rate of advance of per capita output during the post-war growth boomwould have been still more rapid; without the rise in the 1970s and 1980sthe severe slowdown of labor productivity growth would have produced amarked decline in output per capita as well.The sources of the large fluctuation in the growth of labor input percapita in the twentieth century are complex. Some of the considerations\\nare suggested in Table 1.4. Here we view the growth of labor-force per\\n(the labor-force ratio) as the sum of the growth rates of the working-ageratio Š that is, the ratio between the working-age and the total popula-tion Š and the gross participation rate, that is, the ratio between thenumber of persons in the labor force and the working-age population. Wecall it the gross rate because it reflects changes both in the participationrates of specific groups, distinguished by age, sex and other characteris-tics, and in the importance of the groups.In the first period, from 1929 to 1948, the growth of the working-ageratio was modest. This was a direct consequence of the birth rate reversal,from the low and declining rates that prevailed during the late twentiesand the decade of the Great Depression, to the higher fertility levels that\\naccompanied the tightening of labor markets during the forties. The\\ndepressed birth rate cut the fraction of children in the population and sopushed up the working-age ratio, whereas after 1945 the beginnings ofthe baby boom reversed the process.The two decades following World War II saw no reversals of compara-ble magnitude in the fertility of Americans: the birth rate and the generalfertility rate climbed rapidly to a peak at the end of the 1950s, and held\\nat high levels for some years thereafter. Consequently, the proportion ofthe population made up of young dependents rose rapidly and theworking-age ratio dropped sharply over the period 1948Š66, as may be\\nseen from Table 1.4. While this was partially offset by a modest rise inthe participation rate, the net effect was that labor force per capita fell\\nrapidly during that interval.The size of the more severe retardation is uncertain. Comparing 1929Š66 with our own estimatefor 1890Š1927 (shown in Frame I) puts the retardation at 0.5 percent a year. Using Kendrick's esti-mate for 1890-1927 (Frame II) makes the difference even greater.\",\n",

Labor force:Ibid, Table B-30 (Civilian labor force aged 16+.).Toward the close of the 1960s, however, birth rates started their recentdramatic decline and thus ushered in the latest period when the workingage ratio rose almost as rapidly as it had dropped in the two decades afterWorld War II. The turnaround, which raised the growth rate of theworking-age ratio by a full percentage point (from Š0.57 to +0.48 percenta year) accounted for 70 percent of the marked increase in the growth oflabor force per capita.The large fluctuation in birth rates and the accompanying decline andthen increase in the growth rates of the working-age and labor-force ratiohave been well explained by Richard Easterlin.7 On his hypothesis, fluc-tuations in birth rates are caused by changes in the economic circumstancesand prospects of young adults in their most fertile years, taken in con-junction with the expectations they had earlier formed in their parents'households. Given the twenty-year or so lag between birth and entry intolabor force and marriage, a kind of cycle is generated. Thus the cohort whocame of age during the Great Depression, and who carried with themexpectations formed in the prosperous 1920s, married late and had fewchildren. By contrast, the young adults of the 1950s and early 1960s werea much smaller cohort, reflecting the low birth rates of the 1930s and early1940s. This small supply of young workers, meeting the buoyant labormarket of the post-war years, found good jobs and enjoyed early promo-tion and rising wages. And given the modest expectation they had formedin the depressed 1930s, they married early and generated the baby boom.7 See Easterlin's chapter in this volume, and Richard Easterlin, Population, Labor Force, and Long Swingsin Economic Growth: The American Experience (New York, 1968).\",\n",
       " '18 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidThey then spawned the large cohort of young people whose expectationswere consistent with the happy state of their parents\\' households. Andthese then entered the labor force in the 1970s and 1980s where they met\\nthe recent slowdown of productivity growth, the accompanying stagna-\\ntion of real wages, and slower promotion. A rapid decline of birth ratesfollowed.A competing hypothesis lays greater stress on the long-term trendtowards lower birth rates to explain the low rates of recent decades. It sees\\nthe baby boom as an aberration and the more recent decline in the birth\\nrate as primarily a response to the forces controlling the long-term trend.There is, in fact, much to be said about the sources of the long-term trendsthat have helped bring birth rates to their present low levels. The eco-\\nnomic and social conditions of that century have, indeed, made childrenmore expensive to raise and perhaps reduced the benefits that parents mayderive from them. Children can no longer contribute to the ordinary\\nfamily\\'s work and income as they did on the farms of a century ago. They\\noccupy more costly house room in the city. They require long years ofincreasingly expensive medical care and education. They compete for thetime, effort, and income of their mothers when the world of paid employ-ment has been opened to women. As adults they live separated from theirparents by independent employment and often by long distances; theycannot offer the support and care for the elderly that they once did. And\\nthe parental support they used to provide is now far less important when\\nthe elderly can depend on Social Security and private pensions, onMedicare and on retirement communities. Young adults, therefore, are lesslikely to see the benefits and virtues of large families.Still, there are birth rate effects that stem from disjunctures betweenlabor demand and supply. When they occur, they have effects that echo ageneration later. Moreover, they may echo once again, perhaps with dimin-ished force, until a new disjuncture of independent origin occurs and starts\\nthe process once more. The Easterlin echo effects have been an importantcomponent of the growth of labor input in the twentieth century and\\nearlier, and we may see them again.Labor Productivity Growth and Its SourcesBetween the first half of the nineteenth century and the second half (count-ing the years from about 1855 to about 1890 as the \"second half\"), the paceof labor productivity growth more than doubled. Then between the second',\n",
       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 19half of that century and the first third of the twentieth century (1890-1927),it doubled again (Table 1.5). And between the first and second thirds of the\\ntwentieth century, it increased still again, by 26 percent. Counting, there-\\nfore, from the slow rate of the first part of the nineteenth century to the far\\nmore rapid pace of the middle decades of the twentieth, there were more\\nthan a hundred years of accelerating long-term labor-productivity growth.True, this record of unbroken acceleration emerges when growth is mea-sured over the long periods identified in Table 1.5. Within these longperiods, across the \"long swing intervals\" they span, there was a successionof slowdowns and accelerations. And if we broke the record into still shorter\\nintervals, the fluctuations of the labor productivity growth rate would be\\nstill more marked. Wars, depressions, post-war rebounds and booms, thevagaries of the pace of technological progress have all counted. Still, therecord of long-term acceleration is clear enough.Against this accelerating trend of labor productivity growth rates, thequarter-century from 1966 to the end of the twentieth century is some-thing of an anomaly. The occurrence of a slowdown is not in itself strange.As said, there have been many precedents. It is the severity of the currentretardation and its duration which give this latest episode its special char-acter. Compared with the preceding long period between 1929 and 1966,the rate of advance fell 51 percent. Compared with the booming growthof the post-war years (1948-66), the rate declined no less than 60 percent.Not since the second half of the nineteenth century, if we depend on the\\nlong-period measures, has the pace of labor productivity growth been\\nso slow.It is sometimes argued that the slowdown in the years since the late1960s, is not in itself evidence of long-term retardation. In this view, theslowdown may be only a transitory matter, comparable with the declines\\nin productivity growth that accompanied serious depressions in the past.8The slowdown that began after 1966, however, had by the close of the1980s, gone on for almost a quarter-century, which is longer than the fulllong swings of the past, their contractions plus their expansions. Signs ofa faster long-term growth rate in the years since 1989 are still uncertain.\\nThe decline of the labor productivity growth rate between the previouslong swing (1948Š66) and the period of slowdown (1966Š89) is 1.9percentage points. Earlier in the twentieth century, the most drastic\\nslowdown was that between the prosperous twenties and the depressed8 This is the contention of William J.

The averagecivilian unemployment rate from 1966 to 1989 was 6.1 percent; from1929 through 1939, it was nearly 17 percent. The future may well see areturn to the labor productivity growth rates of the earlier twentiethcentury. But even if that does happen, the slow growth from 1966 to 1989and perhaps longer will still remain as an episode of severe retardation that\\npersisted for a significantly long period.What were the elements from which the long acceleration of produc-tivity growth arose and then the recent slowdown followed? The most ele-\\nmentary decomposition of labor productivity growth is one that divides it\\ninto two sources. One is the increase in productivity attributable to theenlargement of the stock of tangible capital that is available to aid each\\nworker per hour of work (Table 1.5, line 2). We sometimes call this the\\ncontribution of the growth of \"capital intensity.\" The other element is theremainder of the increase of labor productivity. We call it the growth of\\n\"crude total factor productivity\" (or \"crude TFP\"). It appears in line (3) ofTable 1.5. We term it \"crude\" because it is a remainder or residual, whichis itself an amalgam of various elements. These are discussed and, to someextent, measured in the lines of the Table 1.5.The formula for carrying out such a decomposition, commonly called a\"growth account\", was presented years ago by Robert Solow. As applied\\nto a decompostition of aggregate output, it reads:Y* = eKK* + GLL*+A*. (1)In the formula, Y stands for output, L for labor hours, and K for tangiblecapital stock (including land). The asterisk (*) denotes the per annum rate\\nof increase over a trend interval; so Y* stands for the growth rate of output\\nover a period of years, and similarly for L* and K*. The coefficient G K isthe elasticity of output with respect to capital and represents the weight\\nto be attached to the growth of capital in contributing to the growth ofoutput. It is measured by the fraction of the value of total output that con-\\nstitutes the compensation of the owners of capital stock for the use of theirproperty: 9K = e K. The \"property income share\" is the sum of before taxinterest, rents, dividends, and the retained profits of corporations plus anallowance for the compensation of capital in non-corporate business. In thegross terms in which we make our output calculations, it also contains\\nan allowance for the depreciation (or retirement) of reproducible capitalgoods.',\n",
       " \"22 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidBecause at any given time, and subject to certain assumptions, the (before-tax) earnings of capital and labor exhaust the total product, the weight tobe attached to the growth of labor is, analogously eL = 8L = (i Š 8K).9Over time, however, the growth of capital and labor inputs weighted as\\nabove does not necessarily exhaust the increase in total product, especiallynot when technological progress is raising the productive efficiency of thecombined bundle of inputs. So the residue of the proportional growth of\\noutput, A*, that is, the part not accounted for by the sum of the weighted\\nfactor inputs, measures the contribution of the proportionate growth in\\ncrude total factor productivity (TFP) Š along with that of any inputs leftout of the accounting altogether, and also the net effect of errors inthe data.Under the same assumptions an alternative formula can be derived bysimply rearranging the terms in Equation (i):10A* = eK(Y*-K*) + (i-eK)(Y*-L*). (2)This equation tells us that A*, that is, crude TFP, is the weighted sumof the growth of output per unit of capital and of output per unit of labor.\\nAnd that is why it is called total factor productivity growth. Technologi-cal progress, the advance of economically useful knowledge actually incor-porated into production, is presumably an important component of totalfactor productivity. But there are other contributors to this remainder.An expression for the growth rate of real output per unit of labor inputcan also be obtained directly from Equation (i):(Y*-L*) = A* + 9K(K*-L*). (3)Since (K* Š L*) represents the growth rate of capital stock per laborunit, Equation (3) gives us a formula for partitioning the proportionategrowth of labor productivity into two components, the contributions ofthe capital intensity growth and those made by the growth of crude TFP.This relationship is applied in making the growth accounting calculationsunderlying Table 1.5.The decomposition of labor productivity growth, that appears in thesecond and third lines of Table 1.5, crude as it is, reveals a strikingdifference between the growth records of the nineteenth and twentieth' See publications by Robert Solow and others cited in the bibliographic essay at the end of thisvolume.10 Under the assumption that aggregate production relations are characterized by constant returns toscale we obtain this by making use of the restriction that the elasticity coefficients sum to unity,and hence: Y = (e k +\",\n",

The twentieth century, for most of its course, not only enjoyeda much faster rate of labor productivity growth than did the nineteenthcentury, but drew its advance from largely different sources. So far asthese measurements can tell us, the labor productivity growth of the nine-teenth century, and particularly its second half, found its source primarilyin an enlargement of the tangible capital stock at the disposal of workers,and it owed its acceleration between the earlier and later parts of thecentury chiefly to a speed-up of such capital accumulation. In the twenti-eth century, on the other hand, the major sources of both labor produc-tivity growth and its period-to-period changes were the elements ofadvance that together account for crude total factor productivity growth.The figures in Table 1.6, derived from Table 1.5, bring out these conclu-sions plainly.The contrast between the two centuries is real, but, to a degree, over-drawn. Crude TFP, which became the predominant part of twentieth-century growth, is less an answer to our search for the sources of growththan a question that presses for answer. The growth account at the levelof lines (2) and (3) in Table 1.5 is, to begin with, incomplete. It leaves outof account the contributions made by changes in the composition of laborinput and capital input which alter the effectiveness of hours of labor orunits of tangible capital.Table 1.6.

       " '24 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidLabor hours are not homogeneous. They differ from one another becauseof differences in three major characteristics of the workers who providethem: their experience, which is a function of their age, their sex, and theirlevel of education. If we may judge marginal productivity by earnings,the productivity of workers rises with length of schooling and, for mostworkers, with their age. By the same test, an average woman is less effec-tive than the average man of the same age and level of education. By clas-sifying worker hours according to the levels of education of the workers\\nwho provide them and weighting the hours of each class by their relative\\naverage earnings, one obtains a measure of labor input that takes account\\nof differences in education. If levels of education have been rising, such\\na weighted measure of labor input will rise faster than the unweightedindex of labor hours, And the difference between the growth rates of theweighted and unweighted indexes is a measure of the growth of labor inputattributable to the rising level of education. By analogous methods, one\\nobtains measures of the growth of labor input due to changes in the age\\nand sex composition of labor hours employed in production. We call the\\nsum of the three growth rates attributable to age, sex, and education theinput growth of labor quality. Weighted by labor\\'s share of total income,\\nlabor quality growth then enters the account as a source of labor produc-\\ntivity growth.The composition of tangible capital per manhour presents similar prob-lems. The annual gross returns to units of capital stock, for example, varyamong assets of different classes. Structures with a long service life carry\\na smaller gross rate of return than does shorter-lived equipment; the depre-\\nciation rate on structures is naturally lower. Nondepreciable assets such asland and inventories have still lower gross returns. Differential tax treat-\\nment causes the gross rate of return before tax to differ according to the\\nlegal form of the organizations employing the capital: corporate business,\\nunincorporated business, households, and so on. Differences in riskproduce differences in gross returns across industrial sectors.

As such, it enters into the growth account subject to capital's shareof total income. It should be understood that when we speak of the growth\\nof capital quality, we do not refer to the important changes in the charac-\\nteristics of capital goods which raise their productivity but are the resultof technological progress. That effect, for which there are no direct mea-sures, remains embedded in the TFP residual.Of the several sources of change in capital's composition, that by assetclass was by far the most important at least since 1948. According to Jor-genson's estimates, the shift of capital among asset classes, principally therelative growth of short-lived, high gross rate-of-return equipment com-pared with structures, accounted for over 80 percent of the total growthof capital quality from all sources between 1948 and 1966.The contributions of labor and capital quality growth were still smallin the early part of the twentieth century.

As for capital quality we argue\\nbelow that its contribution in the nineteenth century was very small and\\nconfined to the years from 1870 to 1900, and the same appears to be truein the early twentieth century because the rapid growth of the relativelyshort-lived equipment fraction of the capital stock does not begin untilthe 1940s.After the 1920s, however, growth in the quality of factor inputs madenotable contributions.

On the other hand, the impact of the slowdown on invest-ment fell more heavily on structures than on equipment, so the pace ofimprovement in capital quality became faster.The figures for quality change in Table 1.5 refer entirely to the twen-tieth century. Yet we believe that contributions to growth because ofchange in the composition of capital input must have been quite smallduring most of the nineteenth century, probably smaller than seems tohave been the case even in the early years of the twentieth century. Theremay, however, have been a modest rise in capital quality between 1870and 1900.We argue as follows, starting with labor quality. In the twentiethcentury, its principal element has been the rise of the educational level ofthe workforce. In the nineteenth century, however, this was growing farmore slowly and making a much smaller contribution to growth. At mid-century, in 1850, the fraction of young people, aged 5Š19, enrolled inschools at some time during the year stood at just under 50 percent, andfor these, the average number of school days per year was still small.The fraction enrolled was probably not a great deal lower in 1800, andhardly rose between 1850 and 1870. There was, indeed, a significantincrease between 1850 and 1870 in the number of days spent in schoolby a student, and this would have raised the effective schooling ofthose workers who as children had attended schools in those years Š essen-tially those who entered the workforce after 1870. There was also a rise inenrollments during the 1870s; by 1880 the fraction enrolled reached 58percent.These developments after 1850 could, indeed, have yielded some con-tribution to productivity growth between 1870 and 1890, but it wouldhave been small. Because an increase of days in attendance took placeonly after 1850 and that of enrollments only after 1870, they could haveaffected only the younger workers of the post-1850 years and then mainlyafter 1870. The bulk of the labor force whose school-age years had beenpassed before mid-century would have been unaffected. Moreover, the risein schooling remained confined to the elementary level.

The average age ofworkers was rising slowly under the influence of falling birth rates; butimmigration, which brought in a disproportionate share of young adults,was an offsetting force. The median age of the whole population, however,\\nwas rising very slowly. To what degree the effect of the rise in age, what-ever it was, may have been offset by an increase in the proportion of womenin paid work is also not clear. Movement off the farm and the rise of non-farm employment surely enlarged women's opportunities for work outsidethe home, and the expense of urban life would have pressed women to takesuch work. The rate of rise of persons engaged per member of the labor\\nforce is consistent with such a development (Table 1.3). Having regard tothese various considerations, we believe that the contributions of laborquality change to productivity growth in the second half of the nineteenth\\ncentury would have been smaller than even the quite low contributions\\nsuggested by our estimates for the early years of the twentieth century.\\n(Table 1.5).Turning to capital quality, it appears that there may have been a smallcontribution from this source in the years between 1870 and 1900. In thefirst half of the century, the total capital stock consisted almost entirely of\\nlong-lived assets, cleared and improved land, houses, and other structures.\\nEquipment made up only a small and stable fraction of all assets - between5 and 7 percent of the total. By 1870, however, the equipment fractionhad become 11 percent of the total, and then grew rapidly to 28 percent\\nin 1900.13The rate of rise in the equipment fraction (in constant prices) from 1870to 1900 was 2.8 percent per year. This was more rapid than the compara-\\nble rate of rise between 1929 and 1948 (1.85 percent)14 when our figuresfor the contribution of capital quality begin. This slower growth applies,however, to an equipment fraction some 39 percent larger than it was in1900. The impact of the relative growth of short-lived capital, therefore,13 This is based on the estimates of Robert E. Gallman. See chapter i in Vol. II, of The CambridgeEconomic History of the United States, Table 1.13.14 The figure for 1919Š48 is from Raymond Goldsmith, A Study of Savings in the United States, vol. 3(Princeton, 1956), Table V-3.\",\n",
       " '28 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. Davidwould have been little different in the two periods. And on this basiswe judge that the contribution from the growth of capital quality tothe growth of labor productivity was of the order of only one-tenth ofone percent a year from 1870 to 1900. Having in mind these con-siderations regarding both labor quality and capital quality, we think it\\nreasonable to regard the nineteenth century estimates of crude TFP as at\\nleast roughly comparable with the more refined figures for the twentiethcentury.What do these estimates of refined TFP growth represent? We regardthem mainly as measures of technological progress actually incorporated\\ninto production together with the gains from economies of scale - insofaras the two can actually be usefully separated. As a residual, however,the figures also include the effects on growth of whatever other factors wemay have failed to identify and measure and which have operated through\\nchannels other than those we have measured. As a residual, moreover,refined TFP is the inheritor of all the errors that may reside in the data orlack of data and in the estimating procedures by which they are puttogether.We observe, finally, that the technological progress that moves refinedTFP is the technological progress (and the economies of scale) that is \"actu-ally incorporated into production.\" Even in a progressive economy such asthe United States, however, the pace of actual incorporation may differfrom the underlying rate of advance in practical knowledge. The mainreason for such a difference in the United States stems from the fact thata portion, probably a major portion, of advances in knowledge must be\\nembodied in tangible equipment and structures and often placed in new\\nlocations. Similar changes are needed to exploit the potential gains from\\neconomies of scale. True, not all advances of knowledge require suchembodiment; some take the form of changes in managerial policies and\\nprocedures that require little or no new capital. Better control of inven-tories may be an example. But new, redesigned, or relocated equipmentis needed to realize a large, presumably the major, share of advancing\\nknowledge.Suppose we take it that the gross capital investment of each year Š atleast in twentieth-century America Š embodies the most advanced tech-nology available to the investing firms of the year. If so, the average levelof technology actually in use during a year depends on whether the capitalstock that has accumulated is made up more or less largely of recent orolder, partly obsolete \"vintages\" of capital and so of embodied technology.',\n",
       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 29In short, it depends on the average age of the capital stock. It followsthat the growth rate of technology actually incorporated into productiondepends on three factors: (1) the fraction of new technology that requires\\nembodiment; (2) the growth rate of \"age-neutral\" embodied technology(that is, the rate at which embodied technology would be incorporatedinto production if the average age of capital stock remained constant); and(3) a \"vintage effect,\" which is the change in the rate of embodimentbecause of the change per year in the average age of the capital stock overa period of time. For any given rate of age-neutral embodied progress, mea-sured progress will be faster if the age of capital is declining, but slower\\nif age is rising. As between two periods, the growth rate of measuredprogress would be retarded if average age rises faster or declines moreslowly in the second period than in the first.The main lesson we draw from our calculations is that the vintage effectmay be of considerable size in comparisons between TFP in particular suc-cessive \"long-swing intervals.\"15 When a combination of Great Depressionand Great War produced a dramatic decline in the growth of the private\\ncapital stock, its average age rose markedly and refined TFP, expressingthe actual rate of incorporation of technological progress, was driven below\\nthe presumptive underlying rate of advance of knowledge. With the returnof peace and prosperity, the growth rate of the capital stock rebounded,the average age of capital fell, and the rate of incorporated progressexceeded the rate of underlying progress. Before allowing for the vintage\\neffect, the rate of refined TFP growth from 1948 to 1966 stands higherthan that from 1929 to 1948. Allowing for the vintage effect, the reverse\\nseems to have been true. But the two intervals offset one another, and thelong-period measure of the vintage effect from 1929 to 1966 is essentiallyzero (Table 1.5). And, for reasons given above, we prefer the figures of thelong period from 1855 to 1890 rather than those for its component shorterperiods, the long-swing interval across the Civil War and the interval ofrebound from 1871 to 1890.What Measured Growth Fails to MeasureReaders were warned early in this chapter that the output growth that is\\nmeasured in the GDP is an imperfect approximation to the growth we\\nreally seek to measure and understand.

These\\nfailures stem from the fact that the price deflators, which transform the\\nvalue of aggregate output in current prices into measures of real output inconstant prices, are themselves measures of the change in the cost over aperiod of a bundle of goods and services of constant composition and\\nquality.16The composition in each period of the priced bundles does, indeed, cor-respond to the proportions in which consumer expenditures were dividedamong the various objects of expenditure in either the initial or terminal\\nyear of each measurement period. In American data, these have beenperiods of ten years or even longer in the earlier data; they are five-year\\nperiods now. Yet, even within these periods, the composition of expen-ditures on the types and qualities included in the standard bundle\\nchanges. More important, the quality of goods within bundles generally\\nrises and new types of goods appear on the market. The improvementin quality has been caught quite inadequately for most of our two cen-turies and the true significance of new goods for consumer satisfaction notat all.Between periods, the composition of the bundles measured is changed.But the growth rates of one period are then linked to those of a preced-ing period in a way that does not recognize the higher capacity of the newor improved products that are represented in the second bundle to meetthe basic needs that consumers seek to satisfy - except insofar as the newgoods have higher base-year prices per unit than those of the products theyreplace. Thus, as said, if a unit of penicillin has the same base-period priceas a mustard plaster, the two count equally. Yet the penicillin can save thelife of a patient with bacterial pneumonia, while the poultice is at best\\nharmless. For the same base-period price per hour of service, electric light\\nbulbs provide more light than the gas mantles, kerosene lamps, and waxcandles they replaced. They eliminated the need to trim wicks, cleanglobes, and maintain the supply of kerosene - and they reduced the fire16 This simple statement exaggerates the difficulty somewhat.

Electric-poweredwashers, dryers, and refrigerators reduced the drudgery and fatigue ofhousework; they freed women for a more varied and interesting life.Together with automobiles and extended hours for marketing, the newhousehold appliances helped women enter paid employment. To thatextent, the growth of measured output is raised. Little of the value of thesenew products or a myriad other examples of new goods and services iscaught by the standard measures of output.Suppose their true value could be captured, how would the growth ratesof output over the two centuries be changed? We can be confident that\\noutput growth rates would look higher in both centuries. But would thetwentieth-century rates be raised more than those for the nineteenth, orvice versa? In the absence of true and comprehensive measures, we cannot\\nsay with assurance, but we can make a tentative judgment. We think thatthe twentieth century saw the appearance and spread of more new and\\nimproved products and services of benefit to consumers than did the\\nnineteenth.A representative consumer of 1800, if transported forward to, say, 1870would have found the composition of consumer expenditures familiarin many ways. About 74 percent of consumer expenditures still went forfood, clothing, and shelter.17 The percentage was still as high as 65 in1890. By 1989, it was only 37. Much of the decline, of course, representsonly the inelasticity of demand for basic necessities as income rises. Butthe point is that it is within the rising margin for expenditure on prod-ucts beyond the provision for these basic necessities that the great changesin the character of goods and services and in the quality of products hastaken place, and these are largely the developments of the twentiethcentury.Major twentieth-century developments in transportation, communica-tions, information, and entertainment and, most important of all, in theprovision of health care and the length of life itself transformed the char-\\nacter and quality of life for people.

With these developments and withthe advances in the treatment of malignancies and of diseases of the liverand heart, death rates have declined rapidly and the length of life has beengreatly extended. The expectation of life had begun lengthening in thesecond half of the nineteenth century as the better provision for pure waterand for sewage systems and waste disposal reduced urban death rates.

And this difference would, of course, register part passu in the esti-mates of labor productivity growth.The effect of more comprehensive measures on the inter-century differ-ence in the growth rate of the output of capital goods is more difficult to18 For these calculations we use the average annual per capita real output growth rates underlyingTable i. i.

If the 1966-89 growth rate of real GNP per manhour is projected intothe future, implicitly assuming that manhours per capita remained constant, they might anticipateexperiencing an average lifetime gain of only 144 percent, or substantially less than that enjoyedby the 1929-31 birth cohort. On the other hand, implicitly assuming that the lowered rate of laborproductivity growth over the 1966Š89 period is transitory and there will be some rebound, the\\n(higher) growth rate of GNP per capita during 1966-89 could be projected forward, indicating again of 237 percent between 1991 and the year 2064.

This meant\\nsuch products as the cotton gin, steam engines for factories and mines,and the belts and shafting that transmitted the power to the new textile\\nand apparel machinery and to wood and metal-working machinery andmachine tools. It meant steam ships, railroad structures and equipment,and the electric telegraph. And all these new capital goods improved in\\nquality over the course of the century. Taken into account, the measuredgrowth rate of capital goods output in the nineteenth century would cer-tainly appear as substantially more rapid than it now is. But would thischange be greater than an analogous reform of the capital goods outputfigures in the twentieth century?That is hard to say, for there were, of course, also important new andimproved capital goods that were introduced during the last hundredyears. Gasoline-powered trucks took over much of the older railroad-freight business; diesel-electric engines replaced steam. Airplanes replacedrailroad passenger trains. Gasoline-powered tractors replaced horse-poweron the farms. Telephone communication became universal in the business\\nworld. Factories were illuminated and air-conditioned, and so were offices\\nand stores. Factory machinery was electrified. Physicians, dentists, and hos-\\npitals were equipped with X-ray equipment, then with the CAT scan andthen with equipment for magnetic resonance imaging. The pain of routine\\ndentistry was greatly reduced by the modern dental drill. Finally, in thelast two decades, the computer has become the most important categoryof new business investment. It would be hard to say whether a more com-\\nprehensive and adequate national accounting system would raise thenineteenth-century growth rate of the real output of capital goods morethan it would do in the twentieth.If we treat this ambiguous result as meaning that the significance ofnew capital goods was about equally great in the two centuries, then thepresumption about the comparative growth rates of output in the two\\ncenturies remains. With a full accounting for the significance of new andimproved products, the twentieth-century growth rate of output wouldexceed that in the nineteenth century Š by an even greater marginthan our present measures suggest.

Better measures, if they could be made, would,therefore, support a judgment that the contribution of the advance ofknowledge to the growth rate of output was, indeed, greater in the last100 years than in the century before.

       " '36 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidA Provisional SummarySix major developments define the profile of growth across the two cen-turies of modern economic growth insofar as this can be drawn from theavailable statistics.19(1) Sustained growth with modern characteristics began in Americaduring the first half of the nineteenth century. It started slowly with anaverage rate of per capita output growth well below one percent a yearover the first half of the century. There was substantial accelerationbetween the first and second halves, and again at the turn of the century.Since then, for a full century (1890-1989), per capita output growthhas risen steadily at a rate hovering around 1.8 percent a year whenmeasured by private output across \"long periods.\" As a result per capitaoutput now stands at a measured level six times as high as a century ago(Table 1.1).(2) The sources of per capita growth have changed dramatically. A firstchange was in the relative importance of labor input per head versus outputper unit of labor input. In the first half of the nineteenth century, theywere of equal importance. In the second half, the labor productivity sharerose to two-thirds. And then for three-quarters of a century (1890-1966),the growth of labor input per capita turned negative, and labor produc-tivity growth has utterly dominated the growth of output per capita (Table1.2). But the period of slowdown since 1966 has seen what is probably atransient reversion to the pattern of the nineteenth century. The coming-of-age of the baby boom cohorts combined with an accelerated entry ofwomen into paid work to make labor input again an important source ofoutput growth (Table 1.3).(3) Other major developments consist of the changes in relative impor-tance that occured among the sources of labor productivity growth (Table1.5). In the nineteenth century taken as a whole, and more particularly inthe second half, the growth of tangible capital per manhour was the mostimportant proximate source of labor productivity growth. It was largelyresponsible for the great speed-up of growth between the first and secondhalves of the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, however, the\" The quantitative picture of U.S. macroeconomic growth in the nineteenth century presented herediffers in some particulars from that in Robert Gallman\\'s chapter in Volume II of The CambridgeEconomic History of the United States. The differences arise largely from differences in the choice ofperiods, our use of gross private domestic product measure of output rather than net domesticproduct, and of manhours rather than worker-years for the measure of labor services.',\n",
       " \"Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 37growth rate of tangible capital per manhour was slower, and its decline inrelative importance was large (Table 1.6).(4) In some part, its decline was offset by the growing twentieth-century contributions of labor and capital quality, essentially by the risingeducational level of the workforce and by the growing importance of short-lived, high gross return capital equipment relative to that of land and\\nlong-lived structures (Table 1.5). The rise of education may be seen as asymptom of a still broader rise of knowledge-carrying intangible assets, a\\ndevelopment that we have still to take fully into this account. But therelative rise of rapidly depreciating capital equipment within fixedreproducible business assets, is another expression (and a tangible one) of\\nthe economy's emergence from an earlier epoch of extensive growth to itspresent dependence on technological progress.(5) Our measures of TFP growth include such gains as derived fromboth technological and organizational innovations proper, improvementsin allocative efficiency of business enterprises and markets, and economiesof scale. Extensive growth, involving rapid population growth and land\\nsettlement, together with its concomitant provision of a great transporta-tion network of local, regional, and national roads, canals, river ways, and\\nrailroads was the material basis for great gains from economies of scale, aswell as the erosion of local monopolies and their attendant inefficiencies.\\nThese may have been a very large element in the TFP growth of the nine-teenth century. In the twentieth century, however, this gave way to more\\nrapid technological progress based on the advance of practical knowledge\\nwith an ever more important scientific base. That progress went on forthree-quarters of the twentieth century at a rapid pace. As measured by\\nrefined TFP (including further gains from the economies of scale) the pacewas more than 3.5 times faster than in the earlier century's second half(Table 1.5).(6) Rising total factor productivity thus became the principal source ofthe present century's rapid growth in both labor productivity and realoutput per capita, but this is only one facet of the more complicated andinterrelated temporal evolution taking place in the configuration of growth\\nsources.

The great rise in the importanceof (refined) TFP growth between the centuries emerges clearly from thistable, and especially dramatically in output per capita than in laborproductivity.We end this section with a question, or, more precisely, a bundle ofrelated questions. Up to a point, the broad profile of inter-century differ-ences we have drawn in sources of growth seems easy to accept. One canwell believe that the growth of labor input per head became weakerand began to decline in the twentieth century when immigration wasrestricted and, when, as incomes rose, workers chose to take part of theirpotential gains in shorter hours and greater leisure. One can well under-stand that land settlement and development came to an end aroundthe turn of the century and that after the very great nineteenth-centuryinvestments in transport and in the provision of the basic infrastructuresof town and city life had been made, the importance of the growth of tan-gible capital should decline. Indeed, the evidence supporting the viewthat such a change occurred is even stronger than these considerationssuggest, as subsequent sections will show. Yet not everything in this his-torical picture is so transparent. Questions arise mainly from our findingsabout the pace of TFP growth itself, the inter-century contrast, and therelations between technological progress and the contribution from capitalaccumulation.On the face of our numbers, TFP growth including both technologicalprogress proper and economies of scale seems very low in the nineteenthcentury and especially in the second half, when it rose at an average rateof only 0.37 percent a year, although per capita output growth was twiceas fast as in the first half, and when the growth account suggests that three-quarters of that increase was attributable to the accelerated growth oftangible capital per manhour. The TFP figure on its face seems smallabsolutely and small relative to its pace in the twentieth century (begin-ning 1890) when the speed of TFP growth from 1890 to 1966 appearedto be at least 3.5 times faster. We may well believe the suggestion thattechnological progress was faster in the twentieth century than in the nine-teenth. But was TFP really so much slower in the nineteenth, when thegreat investments in transportation and the introduction of steam railroadsand the telegraph created local, regional, and national markets and, pre-sumably, large economies of scale, when steel replaced wood and fragile',\n",

Davidiron, when harvesting was mechanized, steam power came to factories, themachine tool industry developed, and the repetitive assembly of inter-changeable parts became common?Turning to the twentieth century, one asks whether a growth accountthat allows only for the growth of tangible capital does not turn a blindeye to the rise of a new source of growth in the form of intangible capital.It is not quite a blind eye since our account makes allowance for the growthof labor quality by formal schooling. That, however, is hardly sufficient.There are other components of intangible capital, accumulated by on-the-job training, organized R&D, and the costly organization of the adminis-trative infrastructure of large-scale business.Having in mind our observations of measured capital accumulation andTFP, we point to a general problem. The growth accounts on which wehave based our description gain their clarity only at a cost. They assumethat the various sources of growth rise or fall and achieve their effects inde-pendently of one another. In the world of the standard growth accounts,capital, whether tangible or intangible, accumulates regardless of the paceof technological progress. The growth accounts assume that technologicalprogress is \"neutral,\" raising the returns and demands for labor and capitalin equal proportion. They pay no attention to changes in the character oftechnological progress that influence the kinds of capital required: land,structures, equipment; tangible capital or intangible. And there are reverseeffects that run from capital accumulation to technological progress.

       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 41we can provide here will necessarily be less than a full \"explanation\" of thesalient features of that dynamic process, and much less than a definitiveaccount. We propose, instead, an historical interpretation whose principalelements can be classified under two main headings, which might bereferred to in an approximate way as subsuming \"global dynamic drivers\"and \"evolving national and regional contexts.\"Under the first heading we include forces having largely to do with thedevelopment and dissemination of scientific, technological and organiza-tional knowledge of an essentially transnational (Northern Atlantic region)character, but which, of course, came to be expressed in particularistic\\nforms in the North American setting. In the second category are influ-\\nences that reflected more uniquely American attributes of the economic\\nenvironment. Among the latter were cultural legacies, social and politicalstyles, institutional habits and routinized commercial and technical prac-tices surviving from the past; learned conditions that were formed by thepeculiar experiences of an immigration society newly colonizing a vast andsparsely settled region that was richly endowed in its natural resource poten-tial; and still others, which reflected particular American nationalresponses to political and social circumstances that unfolded on the worldstage during the twentieth century. We see the historical drama of theU.S. economy\\'s development, and the changing characteristics of itsgrowth-path, as having been shaped by the interplay between those twosets of forces.Technological Progress: Its Critical Role andChanging DirectionAlthough the changing pace and character of technological innovationfigures centrally in our reading of the U.S. historical experience of growth,\\n\"the progress of invention\" Š as it was referred to by economic writers inthe nineteenth century - should not be seen as a wholly independent,autonomous force driving the process of growth. On the contrary, many\\nof the determinants of the generation and diffusion of innovations quite\\nclearly were endogenous to the economic system. At the same time, the\\nmain features of the course of technological and organizational innovationthat so powerfully shaping the economy\\'s growth-path in each century,were neither formed exclusively by the concurrent American economic\\nenvironments, nor were their effects confined to the U.S. domestic productand factor markets.',\n",
       " '42 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidFor the present purposes, then, technological evolution can best beconceptualized as a trans-national, global force whose underlying tenden-cies in regard to pace and direction manifested themselves particularly\\nclearly in the American setting. This was in some part due to the nature\\nof the precocious contributions that inventive activities taking place inthe young Republic had made to the expanding international pool of\\nindustrially useful knowledge. But, perhaps more importantly, inasmuchAmericans were notable borrowers of technologies (and underlying scien-tific principles) from Europe, it also reflected the comparatively greaterplasticity of the economic environment in this region of Europe\\'s NewWorld settlements. The young and undeveloped state of the country leftmuch scope for institutions, capital structures, and cultural attitudes tobecome adapted in ways that were congruent with successful economicexploitation of the productive potentialities created by \"the progress ofinvention.\"There were many channels through which technological advancesdirectly and indirectly shaped the path of U.S. economic development. Of\\ncourse, we see such developments as contributing in a straightforward\\nway to improving the overall efficiency of the economy\\'s use of the factors\\nof production. But the effects of technology changes extend beyond that,\\nand impinged upon the endogenous dynamic processes through which\\nproductive inputs are created. This applies not only to the impact oftechnological change upon the derived demands for stocks of conventionalcapital in the form of reproducible structures, equipment, and livestock.\\nThe ways in which the size and commercial value of the known reserves\\nof nonreproducible (depletable) natural resources are influenced by tech-nologies of exploration, resource extraction, and processing, also areembraced within this view. So too are the shifts in the derived demands\\nfor specific intermediate inputs of natural resources, shifts that may\\nemanate from technologically induced changes in the mix of goods and\\nservices produced by other sectors of the economy. In addition, of course,there were direct and indirect impacts upon the market for labor servicesof different kinds, stemming from the combined effects of technological\\nchange and the alteration of the nature and extent of available capital\\nequipment.Another way of putting the foregoing propositions is to say that ourreading of both the macroeconomic and the microeconomic evidence fromU.S. economy\\'s experience over the past two centuries leads us to viewtechnological change (broadly conceived) as having not been \"neutral\" in',\n",
       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 43its effects upon growth. The specific meaning of \"non-neutrality\" in thiscontext is that technical and organizational innovation had effects uponthe derived demands for factors of production, and thereby affected therelative prices and the composition of the heterogeneous array of produc-\\ntive assets in the economy. But, significantly for our interpretation, thesize of the respective asset stocks also was affected in the process. By\\ndirectly and indirectly impinging on structure of real rates of remunera-tion established in the markets for particular types of human labor andskill, and for the services of specific tangible and intangible capital, the\\ncourse of technological and organizational innovation altered key condi-\\ntions governing the growth rates of the various macroeconomic factors of\\nproduction.Two main motifs therefore will recur in the following discussion. Thefirst theme lays stress on the non-neutrality of the impacts of innovationson the demand side of the markets for productive inputs, and the conse-\\nquent necessity of recognizing technological change as contributing to\\ncomplex interactions among all the proximate \"sources of growth.\" It wasvalid for us to present total factor productivity growth as a separate\\nelement, additively entering the growth accounts (shown above) as a\\ncomponent of the growth rate of labor productivity and, hence the pace\\nof increase in per capita real output. Yet, the non-neutral character oftechnological progress invalidates simplistic identification of the latterwith the growth of even refined measures of total factor productivity.\\nThe second theme is an extension and elaboration upon the first: it con-\\ncerns the differences between the twentieth and the nineteenth century\\nin regard to the predominant patterns of bias in those \"non-neutral\"\\ntechnological impacts. We argue that as a consequence of the altered natureof the \"bias\" of innovation, the twentieth century witnessed shifts amongthe relative demands for productive assets. The new tendencies led awayfrom the accumulation of stocks of tangible reproducible capital and\\ntowards the formation of intangible productive assets by investments ineducation, training, and the search for new scientific and technological\\nknowledge.A Narrative OverviewTo provide a narrative overview of our interpretative account, we maybegin by taking notice of those powerful forces of temporal developmentthat can best be viewed as generic, \"global\" tendencies: they are interna-',\n",
       " '44 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. Davidtionally shared advances in science and technology, considering the latterof those changes broadly to embrace knowledge pertaining to the organi-zation and management of economic activities as well as to the industrialarts. The emergence of the logic of knowledge-based economic develop-ment in the United States during the twentieth century, and many of theinstitutional adaptations that have supported and reinforced that process,is thus not to be understood as a unique, national phenomenon. This wasinstead the manifestation of a broader and more global process, which tookparticular forms in the U.S. setting.The era ushered in by the Industrial Revolution of the late eighteenthcentury in Britain saw a definite and increasingly pronounced movementin the direction of what we today think of as conventional \"capital-deepening\" economic development - the accumulation of stocks of fixedtangible reproducible assets that rose in relationship to the concurrentflow of real output. Part of this tendency involved the growing relativeimportance of fixed capital vis-a-vis working capital inventories, reflect-ing the development of tighter technological complementarities betweennew, inanimately powered production facilities and natural resourceinputs, including capital-energy input complementarities; there were\\nrelative labor-saving advances, stemming from the creation and extension\\nof the possibilities of substituting machinery and non-human powersources for human effort and skill, but which turned out also to be lessconserving in their usage of the raw materials that were being mechani-cally processed. Although the exploitation of these new technologicalpossibilities became palpable first in the British economy of the lateeighteenth century, they began to manifest themselves with increasingforce in the United States even within the first half of the nineteenthcentury.THE AMERICAN ECONOMY S DEVELOPMENT PATHIN THE NINETEENTH CENTURYIn the United States, the period stretching from the 1830s through the1880s saw manufacturing in general follow the path of transformation ofproduction systems that had already been blazed in the textile sector. Butthe transition from the artisanal shop to the factory in this period wasneither equally swift nor uniform in what was entailed across the range ofindustries, as the work of Jeremy Atack and Kenneth Sokoloff has pointed',\n",
       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 45out.20 Even as late as 1870, a substantial portion (albeit the minot part)of value added in a number of consumer goods industries (such as bootsand shoes, clothing, furniture, meat-packing and tobacco) came from\\nestablishments employing fewer than seven workers, and using no inani-mate power sources; and there were still some branches of production inwhich artisanal shops remained the norm. The growth in the scale of pro-\\nduction units, and their accompanying transition to greater use of water-\\npowered and steam-driven machinery, entailed changes in the technology\\nof manufacturing processes, and in the organization of work, materials pro-\\ncurement, and marketing. But the success of the new factory regime was\\nespecially dependent upon the reduction of transportation costs andincreasing access to reliable, \"all-weather\" transportation facilities.These developments were accompanied by increasing \"roundaboutness\"of production, and the substitution of tangible capital for artisanal laborin a widening range of industries that came to cater to and encourage theformation of mass markets for their output. The transformations thus\\nentailed increases in the ratio of tangible capital to output at the macro-\\neconomic level, and expansions in the scale of productive plant Š withcorresponding resource savings and increasing capital and raw materialintensity of production Š at the microeconomic level. The new possibili-ties for profitably substituting capital for labor emerged through processesof experienced-based learning, and trajectories of deliberate inventiveexploration. The latter paths of innovation had been historically selectedby the conditions of relative labor scarcity, and relative natural resourceabundance under which early manufacturing activities were established inthe United States. These were characteristically \"biased\" in a direction thatwas increasingly \"labor-saving\" and \"capital-using\". The overall impact ofthis bias in nineteenth-century industrial innovation, therefore, was\\ntowards raising the ratios of tangible reproducible capital to labor, and to\\nreal output. Indeed, those ratios in the economy rose more than wouldhave been called for merely by the inducement that changing relative\\nfactor prices provided to substitute capital for labor, within the constraints\\nof an unchanging set of technological possibilities.20 Jeremy Atack, \"Economies of Scale and Efficiency Gains in the Rise of the Factory in America,1820-1900,\" in Peter Kilby (ed.), Quantity and Quiddity: Essays in U.S. Economic History (Middle-town, CT, 1987), 286-335, and Kenneth L.

       " '46 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidWhile these tendencies toward \"biased\" technological change werebroadly evident elsewhere in the nineteenth-century industrializing world,we see them as having come to be realized most fully and most promi-nently in the setting of the United States. The reasons for this, andits implications for the comparative international performance of theAmerican economy both before and after the 1890-1913 era (duringwhich U.S. industries ascended to a position of world leadership), arematters that will occupy us in the final section. There we will bring ourinterpretation to bear upon the question of international convergence andcatchup in levels of productivity and per capita real income that occurredin the second half of the twentieth century.A second key aspect of the mid-nineteenth-century transformation,which scarcely can be held to have been a uniquely American development,was the extension of an increasingly dense railroad network, and the ensuingreductions in transport charges and transit times that underlay the shiftfrom waterborne carriage and overland freight and passenger haulage bywagon and stage-coach. These were improvements to which not only greatercoverage of the continent with trackage, but increasing train speeds andcapacities, and the elimination of gauge-breaks and the growth of \"through-freight\" service were contributing, especially after the Civil War.21 Theirimpacts in the restructuring and regional economic integration of theeconomy, and their further ramifications in the re-organization of industrialand commercial enterprises, were both far-reaching and profound.Internal transport improvements contributed to breaking down the\"protective tariff-walls\" of distance, frozen lakes and rivers, and muddyroads that previously had sheltered inefficiently small local manufacturersand wholesalers. Expanded market access, by the same token, continuedto increase the economic viability of ever-larger, fixed-capital intensiveindustrial establishments and thereby contributed to the aggregatecapital-intensity of the manufacturing sector. Thus, over the period from1870 to 1900, according to Robert Gallman\\'s (1986) estimates, the aggre-gate ratio of reproducible capital to value added (in constant prices) roseby 81 percent in the manufacturing and mining sectors, whereas it hadrisen by 57 percent over the previous thirty-year interval.2221 See Albert Fishlow, \"Productivity and Technological Growth in the Railroad Sector, 1840-1910,\"in Dorothy S. Brady (ed.), Output Employment and Productivity in the United States after 1800, Studiesin Income and Wealth, vol. 30 (New York, 1966), and his chapter in vol. II of The Cambridge Eco-nomic History of the United States.22 See Robert Gallman, \"The United States Capital Stock in the Nineteenth Century,\" in Engermanand GaJlman (eds.), Long-term Factors, Table 4.8.',\n",
       " \"Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 47This picture just sketched of industrial transformation as the new andsignificant tendency of the post-bellum decades (1870-1900), however,must be tempered by a recognition of that sector's comparative situationvis-a-vis the rest of the U.S. economy. The level of the aggregate miningand manufacturing capital-net output ratio (in current prices) remainedbelow the corresponding ratio of the comprehensively defined agriculturalbusiness sector, even though it was moving upwards towards it duringthese decades. Although, by the same measure for the industrial sector, the\\nroundaboutness of the industrial commodity-producing sectors wellexceeded that characteristic of commerce and other private business, themanufacturing and mining capital-output ratio was only approximately\\none-fourth of that prevailing in the transportation and public utilitiessectors. Thus the growth of the demand for transportation, and the latter'sconnection with the public utilities infrastructure requirements of anincreasingly urbanized population, were the powerful proximate drivingforces in the economy-wide rise of the capital-output ratio.Technology, Natural Resources, and Human Resources inthe Twentieth CenturyCONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN THE TRAJECTORYOF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONSNew and contrasting tendencies in the progress of technologically relevantknowledge became evident for the closing decades of the nineteenthcentury onwards. A further step in the progression of industrial develop-ment, following on from the supplanting of the artisan shop by steam-powered factories, saw the beginnings of assembly line methods of massproduction. This was a movement that may be said to have sprung fromthe fusion of two manufacturing principles. The first of these derived from\\nthe continuous flow transfer techniques (for the disassembly of animal car-casses) that were being implemented and elaborated in Chicago's largemeat-packing plants during the late 1870s and 1880s; the second involved\\nthe methods of production by interchangeable parts that during thesame period had been brought to full practical realization in the manu-facture of the Singer Co.'s sewing machines, and McCormick harvestingmachinery.Yet, more than two more decades passed before the culmination ofdevelopments along this characteristically American trajectory of techno-\",\n",
       " '48 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. Davidlogical evolution, in 1913, when the Model T automobiles began rollingoff the assembly line of Henry Ford\\'s Highland Park factory on the north-ern edge of Detroit. Great advances of production engineering had beenmade by the Ford Motor Co. during 1908Š13, involving the integration\\nof machine shop, mechanized foundry and sub-assembly operations,the automated conveyor slide, and the accompanying implementation of\\nFrederick Taylor\\'s ideas in the standardization of work routines and estab-\\nlishment of \"work standards\" at Highland Park.But those developments went beyond merely revolutionizing the busi-ness of building motor cars, which hitherto had been essentially an arti-sanal shop product. As David Hounshell rightly has observed: \"The Ford\\nMotor Company educated the American technical community in the ways\\nof mass production.\"23 A deliberate policy of openness was embracedduring the design and construction of the Highland Park plant, and this,along with the subsequent publicity that Ford himself gave to the idea of\"mass production,\" contributed to the rapid diffusion of these new tech-\\nniques throughout American manufacturing. They were quickly imitated\\nby other automobile producers, even those producing far smaller runs ofcars. Within a decade, conveyor systems were being applied to the assem-bly of many other new and complex durable goods, including vacuum\\nsweepers and radios, among the range of electrically powered household\\nappliances that were gaining popularity in the 1920s. In 1926, Henry Fordhimself described the generic principles of mass production as \"the focus-\\ning upon a manufacturing project of the principles of power, accuracy,economy, system, continuity, and speed.\"Accompanying the dawn of the \"Fordist\" stage in the evolution of man-ufacturing, the opening decades of the twentieth century saw the fruition\\nof earlier departures in the inorganic and organic chemicals industries, andin electrical manufacturing and supply industries. These heralded the\\nrising importance of science-based industry and organized industrial inno-vation. Ultimately, the late-nineteenth-century developments in those two\\nparticular fields Š associated with the work of Haber, Solvay, and Du Pont,and that of Edison, Ferranti, and Siemens Š greatly expanded the sphereof new industrial applications of organic chemistry, telecommunications,\\navionics and the commercial exploitation of biological knowledge in agri-culture, animal husbandry, and medicine.An increasing ability to control, and hence to predict the experimental23 David Hounshell, From the American System to Mass Production, 1800Š1932 (Baltimore, 1984), 261.',\n",
       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 49process, and the movement of essentially trial-and-error learning activitiesfrom semi-controlled industrial environments into the laboratory, speededthe organized search for technologically exploitable knowledge. The reduc-tion of the expected costs and uncertainties surrounding the inventiveprocess, in turn, worked to increase the rate of return on R&D investment,and hence increased the readiness of firms to commit resources to newprocess and product research on a regular basis. Integration of R&D as acompetitive strategy within the orbit of business management planningwas thereby encouraged, as was the extension of the R&D approach to the\\narea of production engineering - particularly in those industries (such asheavy chemicals) where the production of new products entailed radical\\nredesign of manufacturing processes.Two further consequences may be seen to have been entailed by the fore-going developments. First was an increasing demand for scientists andengineers and supporting personnel, who could carry on the necessary\\nknowledge-generating and knowledge-applications activities. That creatednew incentives for individuals to seek (and invest in) the necessary uni-versity training. The prospective demand from industrial employers alsostimulated efforts on the part of colleges and universities to adapt exist-ing curricula, or establish entirely new areas of instruction that would be\\nbetter attuned to those needs. This was a movement that around the turnof the century was already beginning to carry the land grant collegesbeyond an initial commitment to responding to the vocational needs offarmers, and into the realms of mechanical and mining engineering.\\nSecond, and somewhat analogously, the development of organized researchin corporate laboratories brought both growing company financing ofR&D expenditures, and political interest in the expansion of public andprivate charitable patronage of research to create a basic knowledge infra-structure that would further raise the private rate of return on applica-tions-oriented R&D. Most of the developments just cited, however,\\nremained nascent, or very limited in quantitative importance at the dawnof the twentieth century. They were harbingers of the coming morphol-\\nogy of growth that would assume full-blown form in the United States\\nafter World War II.It is important for our story, however, to re-emphasize that the U.S.economy did not pioneer single-handedly in the fundamental advances of\\nscientific and engineering knowledge that formed the basis for the rise ofits newest forms of industrial activity.

       " \"50 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. Davidof new contributions to the technologies emerging in the fields of machinetools, chemicals, electricity, and automotive engineering, already was quitestriking in the period 1870-1913. Yet, in being quick to move towardsexploiting the commercialization opportunities that had been created bythe advances of the underlying knowledge base, the industrial sector of theAmerican economy already had achieved a particularly advantageous long-run position in this regard when the nineteenth century drew to its closeŠ the recurringly depressed macroeconomic conditions and financial insta-bilities of the 1890Š1907 era notwithstanding. The start that had beenmade towards the creation of a whole group of new industries came on topof the solid foundations laid in the post-Civil War decades: a heavy indus-trial, mining, and minerals processing sector, which was served by anextensive network of railroads that gave all-weather access to a nationalmarket of continental dimensions.THE EXPLOITATION OF NATURAL RESOURCEABUNDANCEMany features of the industrial structure that at this time was undergoingconsolidation and reorganization reflected specifically American conditionsthat in the preceding century had shaped the path of the country's eco-nomic development. These were first, the great abundance, variety andcheapness of natural resources and primary materials; second, the emer-gence in the course of that century of the largest-scale domestic market inthe industrializing world. Both conditions favored a fuller exploration andexploitation of that century's dominant trajectory of technological progressthan was possible in European circumstances. The technological path wasmaterials-intensive and tangible capital-using but scale-dependent, andAmerican conditions were especially congruent with it. Large market scaleencouraged the invention and use of expensive machinery whose costscould be spread over large sales to a wide market. Abundant and cheapmaterial facilitated the invention of relatively crude and simple forms oftools and power-driven machinery. These made extensive and seeminglyextravagant use of natural resources. Yet, because the latter were comple-mentary with greater use of sophisticated machinery and animate powersources, this profligacy was more apparent than real; it reduced overallproduction costs by allowing firms to dispense with relatively expensiveworkers, and especially with higher skilled craft labor. At the outset of itsindustrial development America possessed abundant virgin forests and\",\n",
       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 51brushlands, and, in the Age of Wood that preceded the Age of Iron, thisprofusion of forest resources generated strong incentives to improvemethods of production that facilitated their exploitation, to use themextravagantly in the manufacture of finished products (such as sawnlumber and musket-stocks), and to lower the costs of goods comple-\\nmentary to wood (such as iron nails, to take an humble example). Indescribing America\\'s rise to woodworking leadership during the period1800-1850, Nathan Rosenberg aptly writes:[I]t would be difficult to exaggerate the extent of early American dependence uponthis natural resource: it was the major source of fuel, it was the primary building\\nmaterial, it was a critical source of chemical inputs (potash and pearlash), and itwas an industrial raw material par excellence.24Beyond that stage, the industrial technology that had emerged by thedecades at the close of the nineteenth century and the beginning of thetwentieth century was based firmly on the exploitation of the continent\\'sendowment of minerals: on coal for steam power, on coal and iron ore forsteel, and on copper and other nonferrous metal for still other purposes.American enterprise, reprising its early nineteenth-century performance inrising to \"industrial woodworking leadership\" by combining technologi-\\ncal borrowing from abroad with the induced contributions of indigenous\\ninventors, now embarked upon the exploration of another technologicaltrajectory: the new path was premised upon, and in turn fostered the rapidand in some respects environmentally destructive exploitation of the\\ncountry\\'s vast mineral deposits, just as in the preceding era wastefullyimpatient use had been made of the nation\\'s virgin forest resources.During the second half of the nineteenth century and continuing intothe early twentieth century, the dominant path of technological progressand labor productivity advance continued to be naturally resource-intensive, but made increasingly heavy use of mineral resource inputs, aswell as being more markedly tangible-capital-using. This particularpath of innovation was, moreover, scale-dependent in its elaboration ofmass-production techniques and high-throughput operating strategies for\\nbusiness organizations. Although the characteristic features of this tech-nological trajectory individually can be traced back to industrial initia-\\ntives in both Britain and the United States earlier in the nineteenthcentury, the ensemble found fullest development in the environment pro-\\nvided by the North American continent.Nathan Rosenberg, Perspectives on Technology (Cambridge, England, 1976), chap. 2.',\n",
       " '52 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidAs has been indicated, one source of the country\\'s advantage in follow-ing this particular trajectory of biased innovation stemmed from the con-gruence between its pattern of input complementarities and the NorthAmerican continent\\'s abundant and cheap supplies of primary materials.The new methods of production substituted tangible capital equipmentfor labor, while making more intensive use of raw materials and energy.Their profitability was therefore enhanced where the relative prices of thelatter inputs were lower in the mid-nineteenth century phases of this evo-lution, the costs of coal as a source of steam power, of coal and iron ore forsteel-making, and of copper and still other nonferrous metals, bulkedlarger in the total costs of finished goods than subsequently has come to\\nbe the case. Those economic circumstances, from the middle of the nine-\\nteenth century onward, had acted as a stimulus for programs of public andprivate investment aimed at discovering, developing, and intensifying thecommercial exploitation of these mineral resources. Ultimately, as the\\nresults of state and federal programs of geological exploration bore fruit,those earlier historical conditions became the foundations for America\\'sgrowing comparative advantage as an exporter of natural resource-intensive manufactures during the period 1880Š1929.25Of course, there were also powerful commercial incentives for privateinvestment in minerals exploration and development. These derivedlargely from the perceived growth of demand, as American manufactur-\\ning shifted away from heavy concentration on the processing of agricul-\\ntural and forestry products, and towards the production of minerals-based\\ncapital and consumer goods. There was, therefore, a fruitful interaction\\nbetween the development of primary materials supply, the advance ofAmerican technology, and the growth of manufacturing, construction, andtransportation activities serving the large domestic market.Thus, the twentieth century\\'s opening quarter saw the continued influ-ence of some of the same features of the U.S. resource endowment. There-after, for a variety of reasons that we discuss below, natural resourceabundance in general, and mineral resource abundance specifically, becameof smaller importance over the broad spectrum of American economicactivity. In special ways, however, it remained a potent influence. A notableinstance is the continuing discoveries and advances in the exploitation of25 See Gavin Wright, \"The Origin of American Industrial Success, 1879-1940,\" American EconomicReview, 80 (1990), 651-68, especially chart 5 and table 6.',\n",

Still more directly, the abundance of domestic petroleum sup-plies yielded by exploitation of the oil fields of West Texas, Oklahoma,and southern California contributed to the creation of a wide group of newpetrochemical-based manufacturing industries in which America took atechnological lead.28Another important set of region-specific influences was linked to thedevelopment of an economically large national economy that was inte-grated by transport and communications systems of continental reach, andwhich, in comparison with other contemporaneous societies, would soonbecome remarkably homogeneous in its political and social structures.From an early point in its history, the United States was among the pio-neers in the elaboration and replication of large, spatially distributed tech-nological systems, including systems of business organization and publicservice provision. Like airline systems, the multi-divisional and multi-plant corporations, and the public school and university systems, the elec-tricity supply and telephone systems first developed locally and regionallyto achieve conventional economies of scale. They were then replicatedacross localities and regions to form dense and extended networks (withcorresponding network externalities) that differentiated the Americaneconomy from all but a few others by the mid-twentieth century.26 See H. F. Williamson and A. R. Daum, The American Petroleum Industry (Evanston, 1959); H. F.Williamson et al., The American Petroleum Industry: The Age of Energy, 1899-15^59 (Evanston, 1963);Paul A.

DavidRISING INTANGIBLE INVESTMENTS AND THETRANSFORMATION OF HUMAN RESOURCESFormation of these large production organizations and systems of distrib-ution that were complex and intricate created new demands for manpower,with needs for novel skills emerging as old ones were rendered obsolete orredundant. The absorption of European immigrants into the Americanworkforce in the post Civil War decades was facilitated by the substitu-tion of mass production technologies that reduced artisanal skill and train-ing requirements for production workers, while raising demands fornon-production workers in clerical and managerial positions. Yet, over thecourse of the twentieth century the overall demand-side impact has beenquite unambiguously that of supporting a rise in the minimum levelof educational attainment in the population, while expanding the propor-tion of the workforce that had undergone prolonged periods of formaleducation.The twentieth century has witnessed two distinct waves of humancapital formation. The first of these was centered in the first quarter ofthe century and involved the extension of high school education to a largesegment of the population, whereas the \"college education\" movement,which formed the second wave, gathered momentum after the mid-point\\nof the century. In the closing decade of the nineteenth century, onlyrather less than half of the population in the age range from 5 to 24years was enrolled in some regular educational institution. From thatlow base circa 1890, the pace of progress began to quicken: this wasreflected two decades later by the accelerating rise of the average numberof school years completed by all males in the age group 25 and older: itrose by 6.4 percent in the decade 1910Š20, by 7.6 percent in the follow-ing decade, and so on, until the decadal rate of advance topped 10 percentduring the 1940s.29 The average number of years of schooling amongAmerican males was thereby raised from 7.56 to 11.46 between thebirth cohort of 1886-90 and that of 1926-30, and the average annual29 The figures for 1910Š40 are based on Edward F. Denison, The Sources of Growth in the United Statesand the Alternatives before Us (New York, 1962), table 4, col. 2. These estimates were made usingthe cohort method, subject to an upward adjustment of 0.2 percentage points per annum to allowfor a suspected reporting error.

High schoolthus became part of the system of mass education in America during thisera, whereas previously it was typically either the final stage of the train-ing of school teachers, or a requirement for the tiny minority of the pop-ulation who sought a bachelor\\'s degree (or the professional equivalentthereof)- Whereas almost one-half (49 percent) of the high school gradu-ates of the mid-1880s went on to receive a bachelor\\'s degree from anAmerican institution of higher education, the widespread extension ofhigh school education in the following decades brought that fraction downto 30 percent by 1906, and to 22 percent by 1926.Although the stock of graduates from U.S. institutions of higher edu-cation was rising very rapidly early in the century, it was still negligiblysmall, and its formation was neither a significant claimant upon nationalresources nor a noticeable influence upon the quality of the workforce. To\\nthe extent that investments in education beyond the common school levelcould be rated as important on either count during the first quarter of thetwentieth century, they were entailed in the public high school movement.\\nThe latter took root first in the Midwest during the 1880s, spread quicklyto other regions in the North before 1914, and by the 1930s had largely\\nbeen completed Š with the widespread achievement of generally highattendance rates, a significantly lengthened average school year, and\\nsubstantial graduation rates - everywhere in the country save for the stilllargely agricultural South.The early phases of this movement, however, cannot properly be under-stood as merely an automatic, market-induced adjustment of the nation\\'slabor supply, in response to occupational demand shifts driven by techno-\\nlogical and organizational innovations in industry. It seems only reason-able to suppose that an important impetus for this movement derived fromthe increasingly widespread public awareness of the developing statisticalassociation between high school attendance and subsequent access to30 See Claudia Goldin, \"America\\'s Graduation from High School,\" Journal of Economic History, 58(1998), 345-74.',\n",

By workingbackward from the comprehensive schooling data presented in the 1940census, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz have been able to show thatthe percolation of high school graduates throughout the manufacturingsector initially was extremely uneven; that those industries which had beenbuilt upon on the newly emergent science-based technologies - such asaircraft, electrical machinery, and petroleum refining - employed largenumbers of high school graduates in both blue- and white-collar jobs, andit appears that this pattern goes back at least as far as the 1910s.31 Detailedjob descriptions and qualifications, developed by the Bureau of LaborStatistics between 1918 and 1921, reflected the increasing role of school-ing-based skills, such as \"knowledge of weights and measures,\" \"record-keeping and computations,\" \"knowledge of how to set machines and testresults,\" \"special ability to interpret drawings,\" and so forth. Yet, thesewere quite atypical among the mass of manufacturing pursuits, and in theolder, staple industries such as meat-packing and cotton manufactures, vir-tually no jobs are listed as having any required level of schooling at all;even a \"loom fixer,\" the most important and skilled worker in the weavingroom, was not expected to have more than a common school education.Furthermore, even in the newer industries drawing on newer technologies,\\nthe job descriptions of this era suggest that very limited levels of cogni-tive mastery actually were expected. Actual command of scientific knowl-\\nedge as a job requirement was limited to a tiny fraction of the overall work\\nforce, and these positions typically required post-secondary training if notprofessional degrees.The new and more rapidly growing industries, nonetheless, had amplereasons for adapting their hiring criteria and job descriptions to match thecurriculum of high school education. Another recent reading of the evi-dence from the pre-1929 era, by David and Wright (1999), suggests thatin setting hiring standards certain personality traits, such as patience, reli-ability, and general amenability to instruction, were given equal if notgreater prominence than were the more strictly academic cognitive qual-ifications.

High school attendance and highschool completion appear to have constituted signals of these attributes,and of the motivation to respond to experience-based wages and job pro-motion incentives that were designed to stabilize and upgrade the quality\\nof the workforce in the leading manufacturing firms during this era. Thus,it was in their interest both to advocate and to exploit the public\\'s subsi-dization of the secondary education system as a screening mechanism,through which \"signals\" of those desirable qualities could more readilybe acquired by workers who also would be willing to enter blue-collaroccupations.32But, there were other social, political considerations that came into playin America\\'s precocious initiation of mass secondary education. Middle-\\nclass support for public education beyond the grade school level, especiallyin preparation for the \"genteel,\" nonmanual pursuits, was increasinglyvocal during the decades immediately surrounding 1900, and this impetus\\nwas reinforced by political concerns to promote \"Americanization\" amongfirst-generation citizens.

These influential currents of opinion, which issued in the pro-vision of tax-funding for state and local programs of mass secondary edu-cation, may be seen as part of the response evoked by the heavy influx of\"new\" immigrants from southern and eastern Europe in the period.

Of course, the pace at which the schooling level of the work-\\nforce as a whole could rise during 1886-1926 was slower than the speedat which high school completion was diffusing through the population.\\nAs the more schooled males were the last to enter the workforce, the full\\neffect of the increase in years of schooling had to wait for the retirement\\nof successive cohorts of older workers since so few of them had as much as\\na year of high school attendance.Indeed, according to Goldin, of the cohort of males born in 1886-1890who survived to report their educational attainment to the 1930 censustakers (when they were 40-44 years old), 72.5 percent had fewer than eightyears of formal schooling, and only 17 percent had 12 or more years.33Among the entire U.S. male population aged 25-34 years old at the timeof the 1930 census, 24.4 percent reported having had four years of high\\nschool education and beyond, whereas the corresponding figure among the25-34 vear olds m 1910 had been only 15.7 percent.

The seventeenth- and\\neighteenth-century origins of institutions such as Harvard College,\\nColumbia College, and Yale notwithstanding, it was not until the 1860s\\nthat Americans first began hearing about the \"business colleges\" and \"stateteachers\\' colleges\" that eventually would bring higher education within\\nthe grasp of the common citizen. By 1880, however, some 811 higher edu-cation institutions (HEI\\'s) were already in existence, haying a combinedfaculty of roughly 11,500 and awarding something in the order of 13,000\\nbachelors\\' degrees annually, though it was not until 1888 that the total\\nnumber of academic doctorates awarded annually in the whole country\\nmoved past the 100 mark.35 While it took more than a half-century forthe number of HEI\\'s to double from the level that had been reached in1880, the average number of faculties per institution had undergone a 3.5-fold expansion during those 50 years, and the annual number of bachelor\\'sdegree recipients per institution had increased 5-fold. Still, only 2 percentof America\\'s 23-year-olds received a bachelor\\'s (or equivalent professionaldegree) in 1910, and in 1930 the corresponding figure remained below 6percent.The major period of advance in the college and university education ofthe labor force, therefore, had been a feature of the post-1929 era, and itonly began to make a large impact on the quality of the workforce duringthe late 1960s and 1970s when the large birth cohorts of the post-WorldWar II \"baby boom\" were moving through the universities. Between 1930and 1948 the number of college graduates expressed as a proportion of allthose who had graduated from high school four years before was raisedfrom 22 percent to 27 percent, a level that was maintained through to themid-1960s.

With the resumption of rising realwages following World War I,36 capital-labor substitution continued to beencouraged, but there also were opportunities to reduce unit costs ofproduction by developing ways of intensifying the utilization of fixedfacilities. This was a strategy that was first implemented in the late-nine-teenth- and early-twentieth-century consolidation of railroads, and thetechnological innovations designed to increase train speeds and power uti-lization. Its roots can also be found, as Alfred Chandler has pointed out,in the high throughput manufacturing regimes that appeared after 1870,when production and direct-selling were extended to serve increasinglywide markets.37Along with the new managerial focus and increasing expertise devotedto increasing the throughput rate of production and marketing enterprises,there came savings on the costs of inventories of goods in process and stocksof finished products, all of which worked in the direction of lowering themarginal capital-output ratio in the nation\\'s manufacturing sector.38 Withthe coming of enhanced transportation and communications facilities, italso was feasible to achieve high stock turnover rates, and narrowedmargins in the distribution trades; the late nineteenth century thus sawthe appearing of the pioneers of that strategy among the large-scale retail36 On the altered industrial labor market conditions that emerged after 1917, and behavior of realwages, see David and Wright, \"Early Twentieth Century Productivity Growth Dynamics,\" esp.19-25.37 See Alfred D.

Butthroughout the next half-century, in the distribution sector small, low-turnover and high-markup firms managed to co-exist with the highvolume enterprises to a much greater degree than was feasible in manu-facturing. Local market power, arising from locational convenience, cer-tainly afforded small stores a measure of protection from the competitionof supermarket chain-stores, and other high-turnover retailers. But thepersistence of the share of the market throughout the interwar era andearly post-World War II years, also owed something to the imposition of\\ndifferential taxation of chain-stores by state legislatures early in the twen-tieth century, and the introduction of \"price maintenance laws\" (startingwith the passage of the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936).39The technological developments that expanded the scope for continu-ous process industries, such as the reorganization of batch productionsystems to move them towards an around-the-clock shift-working basis,and the managerial changes that were required to coordinate the flows ofmen and materials in these high-throughput operations represented inno-vations of the \"tangible fixed-capital augmenting\" kind. These contributedto the turn-around in the trend of the real tangible capital-output ratio,which in the first decade of the twentieth century commenced a secularfall not only in the manufacturing sector, but in the private business\\neconomy at large.A marked acceleration of total factor productivity (TFP) growth tookplace in the U.S. manufacturing sector following World War I. This surgesaw the annual growth rate jump fully 5 percentage points between thesecond and third decades of the century, and it contributed substantiallyto the absolute and relative rise of the TFP residual that we observe (see\\nabove) when the \"growth accounts\" for the first quarter of the twentiethcentury and those for the latter half of the nineteenth are compared.40Annual measures of TFP in U.S. manufacturing are not available for thisera, but it seems nonetheless clear that the discontinuity revealed by com-parison of the decadal average rate of growth for 1919-29 with that for59 For further discussion, see, e.g., Alexander J.

The recent statistical analysis byDavid and Wright41 of the available annual figures for labor productivity(real gross product originating per full-time equivalent manhour in man-\\nufacturing) confirm the upward shift in the trend rate of growth from 1.5percentage points per annum during 1899-1914, to 5.1 during the period1919-1929.While this historical break in the productivity trend was not a phe-nomenon unique to the manufacturing sector, it was heavily concentratedthere. John Kendrick\\'s (1961) estimates of the decadal increase in totalfactor productivity (TFP) during 1919-29 at approximately 22 percent for\\nthe whole of the private domestic economy, whereas the corresponding\\nfigure for manufacturing was 76 percent, and for mining 41 percent. Theproportionate increase of TFP in transportation, communications, and\\npublic utilities exceeded the average for the U.S. private domestic economyas a whole by lesser amounts, while the farm sector was in last position\\nwith a relatively low gain of 14 percent.At the heart of the story, then, was manufacturing, where the accelera-tion was particularly pronounced and pervasive among the main industrialgroups. The movements of the partial productivity indexes for these sameindustry groups over the course of the 1919-29 interval show a strikingpositive correlation, which was a departure from the tendency in thepreceding decades. For industrial labor productivity increases to beassociated with decreasing capital productivity, rather than capital-deepening, reflected in a rise in real capital inputs per unit of real output,\\nmanufacturing industries both in aggregate and at the industry grouplevel were undergoing \"capital-shallowing\" or rising captial productivityafter 1919.A long period of stasis in the real unit costs of industrial labor during1890-1914 came to an end with the outbreak of World War I, and theensuing rapid rise in the price of labor inputs vis-a-vis the prices of both\\ncapital inputs and gross output was sustained during the post-war decade.\\nThe change in relative factor prices thus was in a direction that would beexpected to induce the substitution of capital for labor within the pre-existing set of production technologies. Therefore, it is particularly strik-ing that after 1919 the rise of captial-intensity in U.S. manufacturingproceeded at a greatly retarded pace. Between the 1889 and 1909 census41 Paul A.

But, asJohn Kendrick\\'s (1961) figures show, despite the upsurge of real wagegrowth, during the 1920s the growth in capital-intensity slowed to 1.2percentage points per annum, well below half its previous pace. Thischange, and the emergence of tangible \"capital-shallowing\" tendencieswith which it was linked represented a new departure, which one of us(David 1990, 1991) has connected to the concurrent diffusion of a newfactory regime in which the productive potentialities of the electricdynamo were, at last, fully exploited by the \"unit drive\" system in which\\nindependent motors were placed on each machine.42It is also worth noticing that there was an easing of another previoussource of upward pressure on the aggregate capital-output ratio. That pres-sure had come from the demand to create urban infrastructures - in theform of housing, streets, sewers, and local transportation facilities - to\\nserve the commercial distribution and industrial centers of new regions ofthe country that were being opened up for population-intensive forms of\\neconomic exploitation. James Duesenberry long ago observed that the suc-\\ncessive waves of internal migration, which had carried the \"urban frontier\"westward during the nineteenth century, had the effect of increasing the\\ndemand for fixed capital in new locations, yet did not cause an offsetting,\\ncommensurately rapid run-down of the corresponding capital stock com-ponents in the older cities of the Eastern seaboard.43 Of course, the urbaninfrastructure of the latter region was coming to be more intensely uti-lized to accommodate the large influx of immigrants arriving from Europe\\nin the period 1880-1914. But, until late in the century, the balance of\\nthose forces, working in combination with the related demands forexpanded transport infrastructure in the West, was operating in a way that\\nheld the marginal capital-output ratio above the average capital-output\\nratio in the economy as a whole. With the closing of the frontier and thechoking off of European immigration (by World War I, and the subse-\\nquent imposition of legislative restrictions in the United States), the\\nformer demographic mechanism no longer functioned to sustain a secu-larly high ratio between the level of the desired fixed tangible capital stockand the level of the real gross domestic product.This explanation recently has been elaborated upon by David and Wright, \"Early Twentieth-Century Growth Dynamics.\"43 James Duesenberry, Business Cycles and Economic Growth (New York, 1958).',\n",

The economies we hold up for historical comparison with theUnited States are mainly a sample of those that also began a process ofindustrialization during the nineteenth century. These are the United\\nKingdom and the continental countries of Western Europe. We also paysome attention to a larger group that includes not only Western Europebut also Canada, Australia, and Japan. 8If we look back to the situation prevailing early in the nineteenthcentury, the U.S. level of real GDP per capita was somewhat below that\\nof the United Kingdom, the pioneer of modern economic growth, andthe still commercially prosperous Low Countries (the Netherlands and\\nBelgium). But the young republic\\'s citizens already enjoyed some appre-\\nciable margin of material advantage over the inhabitants of the long-\\nsettled region of Western Europe taken as a whole.49 The estimates for thisperiod are surrounded by particularly wide margins of uncertainty,however, so we begin our statistical comparisons in 1870 when better, ifstill not wholly reliable comparative data become available. At that time,it was still true that the U.S. per capita real output level lagged behindU.K.\\'s, but America appears already to have established a substantial leadover the Western European average and, with some exceptions such as\\nSwitzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands, over all the other individual\\ncountries in the Western European group.There then followed a long wave in the relative position of the UnitedStates. For eight decades, American per capita output grew faster than thatof both the United Kingdom and Western Europe. By 1913, America hadgained the lead over the United Kingdom in per capita output andwidened its lead over Western Europe. And then, in an era marked by two48 This part draws heavily upon Moses Abramovitz and Paul A.

By 1950, the U.K. level of output per capita was only three-quarters that of the United States and the Western European average levelwas only 56 percent as high. Since 1950, the relative position of Europe\\nand the United States has moved the other way. Western Europe hasbeen catching up; by 1992, its average level was up to 81 percent of theAmerican. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, has only held itsown since 1950.All this is succinctly displayed by the figures in Table 1.9. They arebased upon the work of Angus Maddison, whose compilation of interna-\\ntionally comparable estimates of real output, population, manhours, andso forth provides the most widely accepted figures that trace such data overlong periods of time.50 The underlying figures derive from nationalestimates of GDP, which are first rendered comparable across countries byconverting estimates in national currency into a common currency using\\nthe purchasing power parity ratios of a base year. This is 1990 in the case\\nof the most recent Maddison estimates. From that base, comparable figures\\nfor each country are obtained for earlier, as well as later, dates by extrap-olating its converted national output value in the base year by the move-\\nment of its own deflated GDP. This procedure for rendering real outputlevels in different countries comparable is acceptable if the measures areunderstood in those terms; to read them as indicating relative levels of real\\nincome per capita, to which an economic welfare interpretation can beattached, however, would entail accepting stong assumptions about sta-bilities in the structure of international prices. And, indeed, those assump-tions clearly are suspect. The resulting estimates, therefore, must be\\nhandled with a degree of caution that transcends the norm expected in his-\\ntorical reconstructions of this sort, and we rely on them only insofar asthey provide some broad indications of relative levels of real output andAlthough the discussion here tests on Maddison\\'s (Monitoring) estimates, it should be evident fromthe description of their method of derivation in the text that considerable difficulties surround theinterpretation of the level comparisons as reflecting standards of material welfare at various pointsin time reaching back for well more than a century. Part of the problem is the usual index numberproblems that are present in the various underlying national series of real output per capita for each\\nof the countries involved. But, there is the additional difficulty of attaching a welfare interpreta-\\ntion to comparisons of the per capita level of output expressed in the purchasing power parity equiv-alents based upon the structure of prices in the United States circa 1990. The recent work of LeandroPrados de la Escosura [\"International Comparisons of Real Product, 1820-1990: An AlternativeData Set,\" Explorations in Economic History 37 (2000), 1-41, undertakes to express GDP for a widerange of countries in terms of the purchasing power parities that prevailed contemporaneously.These show that the U.S. per capita GDP level already closely matched that of the United Kingdom\\nduring the first half of the nineteenth century.',\n",

       " \"Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 69viewed in comparison with that of other countries, and it is the major focusof the rest of this section.We believe that the trend reversal in America's relative per capita realoutput position is best approached by an analysis of its comparative laborproductivity growth. It is true that the growth rate of output per capita isgoverned by that of labor input per capita as well as that of labor produc-tivity. Relative labor productivity growth rates, however, have been thedominant component. Their movements have been larger than those of laborinput, and they have conformed consistently with those of per capita outputgrowth. Labor input, on the other hand, has sometimes moved in agree-ment with per capita output and sometimes not. We believe, therefore, thatit is the relative growth rates of labor productivity that have been the con-sistent source of national differences in per capita output growth, and the\\nremainder of this section deals with labor productivity.The Theory of Catch-up and Convergence Versusthe Record of GrowthThe growth records of Europe and America during the long periodbetween 1870 and 1950 present a particular problem for explanation\\nbecause they fit awkwardly into, and, in some respects, run counter to thepredictions of a theory now widely accepted by economists, economic his-torians, and students of growth. This is the idea that countries that at any\\ntime find themselves behind a leading country in their levels of produc-tivity have a greater potential for future growth than does the leader. Until1870, the leader was the United Kingdom; in the following decades, thecountries of Western Europe did, indeed, gain on the United Kingdom.But in these same decades, the United States was visibly forging ahead. Itnot only overtook but surpassed the United Kingdom, and it widened alead over Western Europe that was already substantial in 1870. In this\\nrespect, the record is at odds with the theory.The perception that being behind carries a potential for future produc-tivity growth faster than a leader's has been rationalized in the theory ofcatch-up and convergence. Stated in its most elemental form, the theoryrefers to countries that differ only in their initial levels of productivity. By\\nthis we mean that they face no persistent obstacles in exploiting the advan-tages that backwardness is held to present.The potential advantages of laggard countries have at least four sources:(1) They can modernize their capital stock by replacing their technologi-\",\n",
       " '-jo Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. Davidcally obsolete equipment with state-of-the-art assets by imitating or pur-chasing the new state-of-the art instruments produced in leading coun-tries. (2) Because their low levels of capital per worker tend to producehigh marginal rates of return, laggards tend to have high rates of capitalaccumulation - all the more since the new capital can embody advanced\\ntechnology. (3) Because they often have large numbers of redundant\\nworkers in farming and petty trade, they can gain more from labor trans-fers from farm to nonfarm occupations and from small shops to larger scalefirms. (4) As the gains from the first three sources produce a growth inaggregate output and in the size of the domestic market, a wider horizonof gains from the economies of scale presents itself.These foregoing considerations lead one to expect that, in the ideal cir-cumstances envisaged by the theory, countries whose productivity levels\\nwere at any time low relative to that of a leading country would tend tocatch up. And, the rate at which catch-up would take place would varywith the size of the initial gaps.These expectations actually were well met in the experience of theadvanced, capitalist countries during the period following World War II,\\nas may be seen from Table 1.10. When the period opened, the productiv-ity gaps separating America from the Western European countries stood at\\na historically high level. They had been enlarged by the relatively rapidgrowth of the United States during the years from 1870 to 1929 and thenfurther enlarged by the severe impact of World War II on Europe and Japan.\\nBeginning after the war, however, there began a period of rapid catch-up,which has now gone on for over four decades. It had brought the averagelevel of productivity in Western Europe to 87 percent of the U.S. level by1992. Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands have reached pro-ductivity relatives of 95 percent or better. And, as expected, when by 1973the average productivity gap had narrowed substantially, the rate of catch-up declined. The Japanese record since 1950 was qualitatively similar.Moreover, since the Japanese level in 1950 stood much lower than the Euro-\\npean, its more rapid growth since also conforms to expectation.The record of general convergence within the group was also consistentwith the predictions of the theory. The advanced countries had converged\\nonly slowly from 1870 to 1913, and then World War II had caused the\\nvariance of productivity levels to rise. But after 1950 rates of convergencewere rapid, and, as the level of dispersion declined, the rates of conver-gence slowed down.This record of conformity with the predictions of catch-up and conver-gence theory after 1950 stands in sharp contrast with experience before',\n",

Although the productivity levels of these European countriesstood well below those of the United States as early as 1870, they did notcatch up. Nor did Japan, except between 1913 and 1938.The contrast between the experiences of the years before 1950 and thosethat followed clearly demands explanation. One may well think, as we do,that in the period, 1913 to 1950, the forces making for catch-up werequite overwhelmed by two general wars, by the territorial, political, com-\\nmercial, and financial disturbances that followed World War I, and by thevariant impacts of the Great Depression. Such difficulties, however, cannotexplain the failure of Europe to reduce its productivity lag behind the\\nUnited States during the more than four decades of peaceful developmentand widening commerce between 1870 and 1913. Nor do they accountfor the developments that released the forces of catch-up and convergenceafter World War II. We go on to outline a framework within which to\\nconsider these questions.The Elements of Catch-up Potential and Its RealizationWe may group the conditions that govern the abilities of countries toachieve relatively rapid rates of productivity growth into two broad classes:those that govern the potential of countries to raise their productivitylevels, and those that influence their abilities to realize that potential.',\n",
       " '72 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidThe simple catch-up hypothesis would have it that the one element gov-erning a country\\'s relative growth potential is the size of the productivitydifferential that separates it from the leader. Manifestly, however, therecord of growth does not conform consistently to the predictions of thisunconditional convergence hypothesis. The assumption that countries are\"otherwise similar\" is not fulfilled. There are often persistent conditionsthat have restricted countries\\' past growth and that continue to limit theirability to make the technological and organizational leaps that the hypoth-esis envisages. We divide constraints on the growth potential of laggardcountries into two categories.One constraint consists of the limitations of \"technological congruence.\"Such limitations arise because the frontiers of technology do not advanceevenly in all dimensions; that is, with equiproportional impact on the pro-ductivities of labor, capital, and natural resource endowments and withequal effect on the demands for the several factors of production and onthe effectiveness of different scales of output. They advance, rather, in anunbalanced, biased fashion, reflecting the direct influence of past scienceand technology on the evolution of practical knowledge and the complexadaptation of that evolution to factor availabilities, as well as to the scaleof markets, consumer demands and technical capabilities of those relativelyadvanced countries operating at or near the frontiers of technology.52It can easily occur that the resource availabilities, factor supplies, tech-nical capabilities, market scales, and consumer demands in laggard coun-tries do not conform well to those required by the technologies andorganizational arrangements that have emerged in the leading country orcountries. These may render it extremely difficult if not prohibitivelycostly, for firms, industries, and economies to switch quickly from analready established technological regime, with its associated trajectory oftechnical development, to exploit a quite distinct technological regimethat had emerged elsewhere, under a different constellation of economicand social conditions.The second class of constraints on the potential productivity of coun-tries concerns a more vaguely defined set of matters that has been labeled\"social capability.\" This term was coined by Kazushi Ohkawa and Henry52 See Paul A. David, Technical Choice, Innovation, and Economic Growth (Cambridge, England, 1975),chap. 1, for an introduction to the theory of \"localized\" technological progress and its relation tothe global bias of factor-augmenting technical change and for a synthesis of some of the pertinenthistorical evidence.

In the short run, a country\\'s ability to exploit\\nthe opportunities afforded by currently prevailing best-practice techniqueswill remain limited by its current social capabilities. Over the longer term,however, social capabilities tend to undergo transformations that render\\nthem more complementary to the more salient among the emerging tech-\\nnological trajectories.

New concepts of business man-\\nagement, including methods of managing personnel and organizing work,supplant traditional approaches. Corporate and financial institutions areestablished, and people learn their modes of action. Legal codes and eventhe very concepts of property can be modified. Moreover, experience gainedin the practical implementation of a production technique enhances the\\ntechnical and managerial competencies that serve it and thus supportsfurther advances along the same path. Such mutually reinforcing interac-tions impart \"positive feedback\" to the dynamics of technological evolu-\\ntion. They may for a time solidify a leader\\'s position or, in the case offollowers, serve to counter the tendency for their relative growth rates to\\ndecline as catch-up proceeds.On the other hand, the adjustments and adaptations of existing culturalattitudes, social norms, organizational forms, and institutional rules andprocedures is neither necessarily automatic nor smooth. Lack of plasticityin such social structures may retard and even block an otherwise techno-logically progressive economy\\'s passage to the full exploitation of a par-\\nticular emergent technology.

Davidmay long circumscribe the opportunities for any sustained catch-upmovement.Taken together, the foregoing elements determine a country's effectivepotential for productivity growth. Yet another distinct group of factorsgoverns the ability of countries to realize their respective potentials. Oneset of issues here involves the extent to which followers can gain access to\\ncomplete and reliable information about more advanced methods, appraise\\nthem, and acquire the artifacts and rights needed to implement that\\nknowledge for commercial purposes. A second set of issues arise because\\nlong-term, aggregate productivity growth almost always entails changes\\nin industrial and occupational structure.

On the other side was America\\'s rich naturalendowment and its success in developing it rapidly. And because trans-port costs were then also high, this translated into a substantial advantageover other countries in the costs of primary materials and of the final costsof many industrial products Š a superiority evidenced by America\\'sgrowing comparative advantage as an exporter of natural resource-intensive manufactures from 1880 to 1929.This helps account for the fact that it was the era of the 1880-1913\"minerals economy\" boom that saw American labor productivity risingfaster than that of the other advanced industrial countries and eventuallysurpassing the level of Britain, the former world leader. With the passingof time, however, the importance of these inter-country differencesdeclined - for at least six reasons:First, technological progress reduced the unit labor input requirementsin the mineral mining, gas, and oil industries both absolutely and relativeto the costs of processing. Second, mineral resources were discovered anddeveloped in many parts of the world where their existence had remainedunknown at the end of the nineteenth century, so costs of materials atpoints of origin and use outside the United States would have tended tofall. Furthermore, technological advance increased the commercial valueof mineral resource deposits that previously were neglected and added newmetals and synthetic materials to the available range of primary materialsand agricultural products. Third, petroleum came to be of increasingimportance as a source of power for industry and transportation and alsoas feedstock for the chemicals industry. This reduced the disadvantage toEurope of its well-worked mines and the lack of coal resources in Japan.',\n",
       " \"-/6 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidFourth, transportation costs both by land and sea declined markedly, whichreduced the cost advantages enjoyed by exporters of primary products inthe further processing of such materials. Fifth, crude materials came to beprocessed more elaborately and, on this account, primary products becamea smaller fraction of the final cost of finished goods. Sixth, and finally, ser-vices in which the materials component is small have become more impor-tant, compared with foods and manufactures in which the materialscomponent is larger. For all these reasons, differences in developed naturalresource endowments have counted for less in recent decades than they haddone earlier.TECHNOLOGICAL CONGRUENCE: CAPITAL-USINGAND SCALE-INTENSIVE TECHNOLOGYThe technology that emerged in the nineteenth and that persisted into theearly twentieth century was not only resource-intensive, it was tangiblecapital-using and scale-dependent. Exploiting the technical advances ofthe time demanded heavier use of machinery per worker, especially power-driven machinery in ever more specialized forms. But it required opera-tion on an ever-larger scale to make the use of such expensive structuresand equipment economical. Furthermore, it required steam-poweredtransport by rail and ship, itself a capital-intensive and scale-intensiveactivity, to assemble materials and to distribute the growing output towider markets.34Tangible capital-using and scale-dependent methods again offered atechnological path along which the American economy was drawn morestrongly, and which American producers could follow more easily than\\ntheir European counterparts during the late nineteenth and early twenti-\\neth centuries. The early sparse settlement of America's virgin lands and itsabundant forest resources made American wages relatively high and locallabor supplies inelastic. And high wages in turn encouraged the develop-ment of the era's capital-intensive mechanical technologies. American land\\nabundance, and the level unobstructed terrain of the Midwest and trans-Mississippi prairies, especially was well suited to the extensive cultivationof grain and livestock under climatic and topographical conditions very\\nfavorable to the mechanization of field operations. None of these develop-54 With some amendment, much of this section and the next follows the argument and evidence ofseveral earlier writers, particularly Rosenberg, Wright, David and Wright, Nelson and Wright, andprevious work published individually and jointly by the present writers.\",\n",
       " \"Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 77ments could be replicated on anything approaching the same comparativescale within European agriculture at the time.The heavy use of power-driven capital equipment was further supportedby the relatively large, rich, and homogeneous domestic market open to\\nAmerican firms. By 1870 the United States already had a larger aggregatedomestic economy than any of its advanced competitors. By 1913 the size\\nof the American economy was almost two and one-half times that of the\\nUnited Kingdom and three and one-half times as large as France or\\nGermany. America's per capita GDP also topped the other industrialnations in 1913, exceeding that of the United Kingdom by 5 percent,\\nFrance by 59 percent, and Germany by 38 percent.These differences indicate the advantage that the United States enjoyedin markets for automobiles and for the other new, relatively expensivedurable goods, to which the techniques of a scale-dependent, capital-usingtechnology (like mass production) especially applied. The Americandomestic market was both large and well unified by an extensive trans-\\nportation network. And it was unified in other ways that Europe at thetime could not match. The rapid settlement of the country from a common\\ncultural base in the Northeastern and Middle Atlantic seaboard closely cir-cumscribed any regional differences in language, legal systems, local leg-islation, and popular tastes. In fact, Americans sought consumer goods of\\nunpretentious and functional design in preference to products that tried\\nto emulate the more differentiated, elaborate, and custom-finished look ofthe old European luxury crafts. This taste structure, which was commentedon repeatedly at international expositions where American manufactures\\nwere displayed alongside the top-quality wares of the Europeans, owedmuch to the spirit of democratic egalitarianism that prevailed over large\\nsections of American society and to the young nation's freedom from a her-itage of feudal and aristocratic traditions and aesthetic values. It fostered\\nthe entrepreneurial strategy of catering to and actively creating largemarkets for the standardized products of large-scale production.The American development of mass production methods was alsoencouraged by the country's higher and more widely diffused incomes,\\nwhich supported an ample domestic market for the new metals-baseddurable goods. By contrast, Europe's lower and less equally distributedincomes initially restricted the market for such goods to its well-to-doclasses, for whom standardized commodities had less appeal in any event,and thereby delayed the full application of American mass production\\nmethods.\",\n",
       " '78 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidYet, with the passage of time these American advantages graduallywaned in importance. As aggregate output expanded in Europe, themarkets for more industries and products approached the scale requiredfor most efficient production, with plants embodying technologies thathad been developed to suit American conditions. Furthermore, the decline\\nin transportation costs and the more liberal regime of international tradeand finance that emerged between 1880 and 1913 encouraged producersto use international markets to achieve the scale required. From 1870 to1913, the average growth rate of exports in continental Europe was 43percent greater than GDP growth.55 Of course, there was a still greaterexpansion of trade during the 1950s and 1960s, when the growth of Euro-pean exports exceeded the growth of their collective GDP (both in con-stant prices) by 89 percent. In this era, rising per capita incomes alsohelped assure that scale requirements in the newer mass-production indus-tries producing consumer and producer durables would be satisfied for awidening range of commodities. As larger domestic and foreign marketsappeared, laggard countries could begin to switch in a thoroughgoing wayto exploit the capital-using and scale-dependent techniques alreadyexplored by the United States. This was a path toward catch-up that wouldprove to be especially important after World War II, even though it hadbegun to be followed by some large industrial enterprises in Europe andJapan during the interwar period.56Still another significant cause of the decline in American advantagewas a gradual alteration in the nature of technological progress itself.The former bias in the direction of tangible reproducible capital-using,\\nscale-dependent innovations became less pronounced toward the end of\\nthe nineteenth century. And in the new century, the direction of innova-\\ntion, driven in part by the advance of science, began to favor investment\\nin intangible assets. In short, the new bias of technological and organiza-tional progress tended to raise the rate of return on investment in the dis-covery and development of more advanced technology and in the creationof the more highly educated workforce and citizenry needed to makeuse of it.These were trends with global dimensions. Europe and Japan exhibitedthem though with some lag. But it was only with the return of peace after\" See Angus Maddison, Dynamic Forces of Capitalist Development (Oxford, 1991), tables 3.2 and 3.15.* See Edward F. Denison, Why Growth Rates Differ (Washington, D.C., 1967), chap. 17; Edward F.Denison and William Chung, How Japan\\'s Economy Grew So Fast (Washington, D.C., 1976),chap. 10.',\n",

Indoing so, they positioned themselves to soon be able to keep pace with,and, indeed, contribute to the further extension of those globally sharedtechnological trajectories contemporaneously.SOCIAL CAPABILITYEven in the later nineteenth century, all of the presently advanced grouphad certain similar features. All had substantially independent nationalgovernments at least as early as 1871. Broadly speaking, all the countriesexcept Japan shared much of the older culture of Western Europe. Mostimportant, all the countries, again excepting Japan, have lived during theentire period under basically stable economic constitutions that providefor a system operated mainly by business enterprises coordinated bymarkets for goods, labor, capital, and land. In Japan, although a middleclass of merchants had arisen even under the Shogunate, the countryretained much of its older feudal character until the Meiji Restoration of1868. Thereafter, however, it was rapidly transformed, and by the turnof the century had established its own form of private enterprise, marketeconomy.57Beyond their economic constitutions, however, noteworthy differencesworked to impair the ability of European countries to catch up to theUnited States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Nineteenth-century America presented a contrast with Western Europe inits social structure, its people\\'s outlook, and their standards of behavior.In America, plentiful land offered a widespread opportunity to achieve asatisfactory income by the standards of the time. It fostered a relativelyequal distribution of income and wealth and an egalitarian spirit.America\\'s Puritan strain in religion tolerated and even encouraged thepursuit of wealth. The older European class structure and feeling did notsurvive America\\'s wider dispersion of property and opportunity. Ameri-cans judged each other more largely on merit, and, lacking other signs ofmerit, wealth became the main badge of distinction. America\\'s social andeconomic circumstances encouraged effort, saving, and enterprise and gavetrade and the commercial life in general a status as high or higher thanthat of other occupations.\" See, e.g., Henry Rosovsky, Capital Formation in Japan, 1868Š1940 (New York, 1961); Ohkawa andRosovsky, Japanese Economic Growth.',\n",
       " \"80 Moses Abramovitz and Paul A. DavidWhile the social background of economic life in the countries ofnineteenth-century Europe was of course not uniform, there were certaincommonalities in their divergence from American conditions of the time.In all the European countries, a traditional class structure - which sepa-rated a nobility and gentry from the peasantry, the tradesmen, and anexpanding middle class Š survived into the nineteenth century. Social dis-tinction rested more on birth and the class status it conveyed than onwealth. Insofar as social distinction did turn on wealth, inherited wealth\\nand income counted for more than earned income or the wealth gained by\\ncommerce, and landed wealth stood higher than financial wealth and stillhigher than industrial or commercial. The middle class who aspired to\\nmembership in the gentry or nobility bought rural seats and adopted\\nupper-class standards of conspicuous consumption. In short, the social\\norder of Western Europe diluted the characteristic American preoccupa-tion with material success.These differences in the bases of social distinction Š and therefore in thepriority assigned to economic attainment Š influenced many kinds ofbehavior that matter for productivity growth. They shaped the occupa-\\ntional choices of both the European gentry and bourgeoisie. When family\\nincome was adequate, sons were pointed towards the occupations that the\\nupper classes regarded as gentlemanly or honorific: the military, the civil\\nservice, the church and, well behind, the professions. Even in the sphereof business, finance held pride of place, all to the detriment of commerce\\nand industry.In Europe, a related tradition from pre-industrial times influenced edu-cation in a way that reinforced these preexisting patterns of occupationalchoice. The curricula in the secondary schools continued to emphasize thetime-honored subjects of the classics and mathematics; the faculties ofEurope's ancient and most prestigious universities dwelt upon these and\\nalso theology, law, and medicine. Throughout Europe, university curric-\\nula emphasized what was regarded as proper for gentlemen destined forthe clergy, the civil service, and the liberal professions.58 Although train-ing in engineering did win a place for itself in both France and Germanyearly in the nineteenth century, its character in both countries was theo-retical, concerned with preparing an elite cadre of engineer-candidates toserve the state in administrative and regulatory capacities. In contrast, bySee, e.g., Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America (1840; reprint, New York, 1945), vol. II, FirstBook, chap. X.\",\n",
       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 81the late nineteenth century, engineering schools in America clearly hadevolved a more practical, commercial, and industrial bent.The striving for honorific status also helped to limit the size of firmsbecause families were eager to confine ownership and control withinthe circle of close kin. Moreover, aristocratic standards of quality and\\nindividuality in consumption worked to inhibit the development ofstandardized goods and mass production, and they supported an extreme\\nfragmentation of retail trade. Similarly, a business ethos that can be tracedback to the medieval guilds discouraged aggressive innovation and pricecompetition in favor of maintaining a high standard of quality in tradi-tional product lines. In some countries too Š England is a prominentexample Š class feeling delayed the spread of mass education even at theprimary level.Neither social structure nor outlook, however, remained frozen in theirnineteenth-century forms. As economic development proceeded, the social\\nstatus and political power of European business rose. The occupational\\ntargets of middle-class youth gradually shifted. Business and the pursuitof wealth as a road to social distinction (as well as material satisfaction)became more appealing. Entrepreneurs became more familiar with publiccorporations, more receptive to outside capital as a vehicle for expansion,\\nand more experienced in the organization, finance, and administration of\\nlarge-scale business. The small, specialized retail shop retained much of\\nits old importance into the 1930s. But after World War II, the big, fixed-price chain stores expanded beyond the beachhead that companies such asWoolworth, and Marks and Spencer, previously had established in Britain.The American-style supermarket, aided by the automobile and the homerefrigerator, began to transform European retail food distribution.The timing of this change around World War II is not accidental; thewar itself had a profound impact on social structure and outlook. Inthe aftermath of the war, great steps were taken to democratize educa-\\ntion. State-supported secondary schooling and universities were rapidlyexpanded, literally hundreds of new university campuses were constructed\\nand staffed, and public support for the maintenance of university students\\nwas initiated. For virtually all the new students, careers in industry, trade,banking, and finance became the mecca, not the traditional honorific occu-pations. In France, even the polytechniciens joined industrial firms. Curric-ula were modified to fit the more practical concerns of this much-expandedstudent population. Schools of engineering and business administration\\nwere founded or enlarged. Even Britain, the perennial laggard in educa-',\n",

Davidtional reform, responded by opening its new system of comprehensivesecondary schools and its new redbrick universities and polytechnicalcolleges.The most important change of outlook was in the public attitudetowards economic growth itself. In the first half of the century, and par-ticularly in the interwar years, the major concerns had been income dis-tribution, trade protection, and unemployment. After the war, it wasgrowth that gripped people's imagination, and growth became the premier\\ngoal of public policy. Throughout Europe and in Japan, programs of publicinvestment were undertaken to modernize and expand the infrastructureof roads, harbors, railroads, electric power, and communications. The\\ndemand for output and employment was supported by monetary and fiscal\\npolicy. The supply of labor was enlarged by opening borders to immigrants\\nand guest workers. Productivity growth was pursued by enlarging mass\\nand technical education, by encouraging R&D, and by state support forlarge-scale firms in newer lines of industry. The expansion of internationaltrade, with all its significance for industrial specialization, the equaliza-\\ntion of factor prices, and the transmission of technology, was promoted bysuccessive General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rounds, andby the organization of the Common Market and the European Free TradeAssociation (EFTA).We hold, therefore, that many features of European (and Japanese) socialstructure and outlook had tended to delay catch-up in the nineteenthcentury. But these inhibitions weakened in the early twentieth century,\\nand, in the new social and political milieu of postwar reconstruction, crum-bled altogether. In the aftermath of World War II, these developments\\njoined to reinforce the vigorous catch-up process that had been released by\\nthe new concordance between the requirements of the forms of technol-ogy and organization that had appeared in America and the economic char-\\nacteristics that now obtained in Western Europe and Japan.CONDITIONS PROMOTING THE REALIZATIONOF POTENTIALFollowing the severe disturbance of production and commerce caused by\\ntwo world conflicts, the post-World War I barriers to commerce, and by\\nthe Great Depression, the return of peace in 1945 proved the beginningof a time when advances in technology and better political policy sup-ported the rapid realization of potential growth.\",\n",
       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 83New conditions favored the diffusion of technology. Transport, com-munications, and travel became faster and cheaper. Multinational cor-porate operations expanded, creating new channels for the inter-national transfer of technology, management practices, and modes ofconducting R&D. Heavier investment in R&D was encouraged by a\\ncloser connection between basic science and technological applications,\\nwhile the open, international character of much of the basic scienceresearch community fostered the rapid dissemination of information\\nabout new and more powerful research techniques and instruments that\\nwere equally applicable for the purposes pursued in corporate R&D\\nlaboratories.Industry was able to satisfy a growing demand for labor without creat-ing the tight labor markets that might otherwise have driven up wages\\nunduly and promoted price inflation. Some key factors here were that\\nunions had been weakened by war, unprecedentedly rapid labor produc-tivity growth in agriculture was freeing up workers from that sector, and\\nEurope\\'s borders were opened wider to immigrants and guest workers. U.S.\\nimmigration restrictions themselves helped to create more flexible labor-market conditions in Europe.Governmental policies at both the national and international levelsfavored investment, trade, and the spread of technology. The dollar-\\nexchange standard established at Bretton Woods, together with U.S. mon-\\netary and fiscal policy and U.S. capital exports, overcame the initial\\nconcentration of gold and other monetary reserves in this country.

Nonetheless, it is important toremember that the rapid and systematic productivity convergence of thepostwar years rested on a fortunate historical conjuncture of strong poten-\" For further discussion, see Moses Abramovitz, \"Rapid Growth Potential and Its Realization: theExperience of Capitalist Economies in the Postwar Period,\" in Edmond Malinvaud, ed., EconomicGrowth and Resources, vol. i, The Major Issues (London, 1979) (Reprinted in Moses Abramovitz,Thinking About Growth [New York, 1989], chap. 6).',\n",

Davidtial for catching-up with the emergence of international and domestic eco-nomic conditions that supported its rapid realization.Many of the elements forming that conjuncture have now weakened ordisappeared; most plainly the large productivity gaps that had separatedlaggards from the leader have now become very much smaller. The break-up of that favorable constellation of forces has slowed both the rate of\\ncatch-up and of convergence within the group of advanced countries. Thegreat opportunities for rapid growth by modernization now belong to thenations of Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America- provided they can overcome the deep-rooted political obstacles and theconstraints imposed by their still-deficient levels of social capability.Among the presently advanced capitalist nations, the question iswhether the present substantial equality in productivity levels will long\\npersist. Will a new bend in the path of technical advance again create acondition of superior technological congruence and social capability for\\none country? Or will conditions that support the diffusion and applica-tion of technical knowledge become even more favorable? And will tech-nology continue to pose demands for political and social readjustment andrehabilitation that many countries can meet? For the foreseeable future,convergent tendencies appear to be dominant. But the full potential of thestill-emergent age of information and communication and biological andbiomedical progress is yet to be revealed. The industrialization of the hugepopulations of South and Southeast Asia may change the worlds of indus-try and commerce in ways that are now still hidden.STATISTICAL APPENDIXSources and Procedures for Nineteenth-CenturyData (Frame I)With some minor revision, the following description first appeared as anAppendix to a paper by Moses Abramovitz, \"The Search for the Sources of\\nGrowth: Areas of Ignorance, Old and New.\" This was published in theJournal of Economic History, 53 (1993). A more detailed description ofsources and procedures behind the output and labor input data for theperiod 1800-60 is provided in David, \"Real Income and EconomicWelfare in the Early Republic\" (1996). These estimates can be comparedwith the alternative figures available from Robert Gallman\\'s chapter inVolume II of The Cambridge Economic History of the United States.',\n",
       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 85The tables in Frame I include a period (1890-1927 in the long periodmeasures based on 1890-1905 and 1905-27 in the long-swing measures),which provides an overlap between Frames I and II. The estimates pre-sented in Frame I rest on the Abramovitz-David figures first published inMoses Abramovitz and Paul A. David, \"Reinterpreting Economic Growth:Parables and Realities,\" American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings 63(1973), and, after minor revision, in David, \"Invention and Accumulationin America\\'s Economic Growth: A Nineteenth-Century Parable,\" Journalof Monetary Economics 6 (1977), Supplement. Those estimates, which in theearlier papers referred to the domestic economy, are now revised to referto the private domestic economy; and other revisions have been made sincethen as well.REAL GROSS PRIVATE DOMESTIC PRODUCT (RGPDP)The growth rates were computed from an underlying constant dollar series,expressed alternatively in i860 dollars, which was formed from chainedLaspeyres output indices, using 1840 (census year) price weights for theperiod 1800/40, i860 (census year) price weights for 1840/1909, and1929 price weights for 1909/29.RGPDP was estimated by subtracting estimates of real governmentproduct (in corresponding constant prices) from estimates of real grossdomestic product (RGDP). The latter series consists of the 1977 vintageAbramovitz-David estimates, on a comprehensive scope (so-called VariantII) basis, which includes the estimated value of home manufactures andimprovements made to farmland. The latter series are those that underliethe tables in David, \"Invention and Accumulation.\" They differ notablyin the 1800 to 1834/36 interval from the estimates reported for real grossdomestic product earlier by the authors due to revisions in the method ofconstructing estimates for the pre-1840 era Š principally the substitutionof estimates of labor inputs on a full-time equivalent manhours basis forthose on a gainful worker basis.Estimates of real government product, expressed in i960 constantdollars, were derived from a chained Laspeyres index. The constituentseries for the period 1890/1929, in 1929 prices, is from Kendrick, Pro-ductivity Trends in the United States, Table A-III, col. 5 (\"Government Pur-chases\"). These were extrapolated from 1890 to 1840 on estimates ofconstant dollar government expenditures, in i860 (census year) prices. Thelatter series was derived by deflating the sum of current dollar estimated',\n",

Parker et al., Amer-ican Economic Growth, tables 17.1, 17.2. The deflator used for this was theDavid-Solar Consumer Price Index (from Table 5 .A in P. A. David and P.Solar, \"A Bicentenary Contribution to the History of the Cost of Livingin America\" in Research in Economics History, 2(1977), 1-80. The resultingseries was extrapolated from 1840 to 1800 on estimates of constant dollargross purchases of the federal government, derived by employing theDavid-Solar CPI as a deflator for current dollar estimates from Paul M.Trescott (\"The U.S. Government and National Income, 1790-1860,\") inWilliam N. Parker (ed.), Trends in the American Economy in the NineteenthCentury, table 2, 339.FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT (FTE) MANHOURS INPRIVATE DOMESTIC ECONOMYEstimates of FTE manhours of labor input have been derived by subtract-\\ning estimated manhour employment estimates for government, military,and education sectors from the FTE manhours estimates underlying thetables in Abramovitz and David, \"Reinterpreting\". The latter estimateswere obtained from estimates of the distribution of the gainfully occupied\\nwork force among ten one-digit standard industrial classification sectors,assuming that constant within-sector ratios between FTE manhours andgainful workers were maintained between 1800 and 1900. The level of theresulting series for the total national (also domestic) economy was linkedin 1900 to the FTE manhours estimates in Kendrick, Productivity TrendsTable A-X.The underlying Abramovitz-David sectoral estimates of the gainfulwork force, which were built on the earlier estimates of Lebergott and ofGallman and Weiss contain adjustments designed to reduce the noncom-parability between census observations up to i860 and those afteri860. The adjustments were needed due to the U.S. convention of notincluding free married women as part of the farm work force, whichresulted in the elimination of female former slaves from the agriculturalwork force counts. For dates from 1869 onward, estimates of black femaleworkers on farms were added to the agricultural work force figures. Forthe period before 1840 only three major occupational sectors could be dis-tinguished on a gainful worker basis: farm, nonfarm commodity produc-tion (with estimated interval weights for forestry and fishing, mining,',\n",
       " 'Growth in the Era of Knowledge-Based Progress 87construction, and manufacturing), and noncommodity production. Themanhours per gainful worker coefficients for those aggregates in 1840 wereapplied in extrapolating the estimates backward to 1800. To obtain man-hours estimates for the private economy for the pre-1840 period, the dif-ference in the national and private economy manhours trend over theinterval 1840/60 was assumed to have applied in the entire 1800/60period.REAL REPRODUCIBLE AND NONREPRODUCIBLECAPITAL STOCK INDEX (c)Indices of the constant dollar net stock of reproducible tangible capital(inclusive of improvements to farmland), K, and of the constant dollarnonreproducible stock (unimproved farmland), R, were aggregated to forma weighted geometric index of real capital inputs for each trend period.The factor share weights used were the imputed returns to each type ofproperty as a fraction of the gross income from all (domestic) tangibleassets. The weights, and the per annum growth rates of K and R, respec-tively, are those given in Abramovitz and David, \"Reinterpreting,\" Table2, 31. The growth rate of the resulting aggregate index, C, is equivalentto a Divisia index, as the weights change each subperiod. The entriesfor C in Table 1.5 were obtained by the following operation: 1 + C =antiln{,QR{ln(i + R)} + 9K{ln(i + K)}]; they differ slightly from thoseshown for the same variable in Abramovitz and David, \"Reinterpreting,\"where the percentage growth rates were erroneously directly aggregatedusing the indicated weights.GROSS INCOME SHARE OF TANGIBLE PROPERTYAverage gross factor shares for reproducible tangible capital inclusive offarm improvements (net stock basis), K, and for land exclusive of farmimprovements (R), from Abramovitz and David, \"Reinterpreting\", table2, were summed to obtain the gross share of tangible property in grossdomestic income. Trend period averages were computed as geometricmeans of gross factor share estimates for the terminal dates. The estimatescited here were made by imputation, using average real net rates of returnand depreciation rates for private reproducible assets, and real net rates ofreturn on private nonreproducible assets, multiplying each by the corre-sponding ratio of the real net stock of capital to gross private domestic',\n",

They are, therefore, entirely consistent with the GPDP basis forthe computations reported in Tables 1.5 and 1.6.These estimates for the nineteenth century described here are clearly notthe only treatments of the available evidence that deserve consideration.Others are cited in the bibliographic essay at the end of this volume.The periods for which measures were originally calculated are those usedin the measures over long swing intervals. They are meant to be measures\\nbetween comparable phases of successive \"long swings.\" The earliest date,1800, is simply the initial year of our data. For the rest of Frame 1, withone exception, growth rates were based on the average standing of each series\\nduring the five years immediately preceding the onset of major business\\ndepressions. Thus \"1855\" refers to the midyear of the five-year period from1853 to 1857, 1871 stands for 1869 to 1873, and so on. 1835, however,represents a three-year period, from 1834 to 1836. The same system was\\nfollowed through 1927 (1925 to 1929). The growth rates over the \"long\\nswings\" were then combined to form the measures over long periods. The\\nlong-swing estimates will be presented in a subsequent publication.Sources and Procedures for the Twentieth CenturyData (Frame II)The twentieth-century tables contain a period (1890Š1927 in the long-\\nperiod measures based on 1890-190 5 and 1905-27 in the measures overlong swings), which provides an overlap between Frames I and II. The ter-minal dates of periods beginning 1929 are based on single-year data forthe peaks of the business cycles that mark the termini of long-swing expan-sions and, in the measures over long periods, the termini of long periods.In the twentieth century, the major decision involved in combininggrowth rates over long-swings into long-period measures is set forth inthe text. In addition, we view the long period from 1890 to 1927 as theera of electrification. It combines an early subperiod (1890 to 1905), whenthe potentials of electric power and internal combustion were only being\\nslowly realized and applied, with a later subperiod (1905 to 1927), when\\nAmerican manufacturing was being rapidly electrified and when gasoline-powered tractors, automobiles, and trucks came into their own. Finally,there are the years since 1966, the years of productivity slowdown. It\\nremains to be seen whether these years were also a time of backloggedpotential, like ,1929 to 1948, to be followed again by a sustained periodof rapid realization of potential productivity growth.',\n",
