0,"Bearing witness to this shocking act of brutality was twenty-two-year-old colonel George Washington, entrusted by the colonial Virginia legislature to lead a military expedition to the strategically critical Forks of the Ohio, meeting point of the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers, in order to blunt further French encroachment on lands claimed by Virginia. The expedition had departed from Alexandria, Virginia, in early May 1754, marching through the dense forests of the mountains of western Maryland and Pennsylvania along an Indian path known as Nemacolin’s Trail in honor of the Delaware chief said to be its originator. Washington encamped at a clearing in southwestern Pennsylvania known as Great Meadows, a small island of open space in a vast ocean of forest. There he rendezvoused with Tanaghrisson, whom he first had met on an expedition to the Ohio Country the previous November. On that journey Washington had warned the French – who had recently evicted a small British force from the forks of the Ohio and who had begun construction of an outpost on that spot they would name Fort Duquesne – against remaining in the Ohio Country. Returning the following spring, he had enlisted Tanaghrisson – an ambitious Seneca leader of dubious authority – and his followers in a campaign against the French.","['twenty-two-year-old', 'early May 1754', 'the previous November', '–']",bear witness shocking act brutality year old colonel george washington entrust colonial virginia legislature lead military expedition strategically critical fork ohio meeting point allegheny monongahela ohio river order blunt french encroachment land claim virginia expedition depart alexandria virginia early 1754 march dense forest mountain western maryland pennsylvania indian path know nemacolin ’s trail honor delaware chief say originator washington encamp clearing southwestern pennsylvania know great meadow small island open space vast ocean forest rendezvous tanaghrisson meet expedition ohio country previous november journey washington warn french – recently evict small british force fork ohio begin construction outpost spot fort duquesne – remain ohio country return follow spring enlist tanaghrisson – ambitious seneca leader dubious authority – follower campaign french,118,[1754],1754,1,1775,1800
1,"Washington had a personal as well as patriotic interest in wresting the Ohio Country from the French and their Indian allies. After his brother Lawrence’s early death in 1752, Washington had inherited a substantial share of the Ohio Company, a joint stock company of elite Northern Virginia gentry who saw in the western country the next great speculative real estate bonanza. These men, among them Virginia lieutenant governor William Dinwiddie, had been agitating London for some time to assert more strongly Virginia’s claim to the Ohio Country, only one part of a more than half-century-long confrontation between Britain and France for imperial control of North America. Washington’s own claim to Virginia’s western lands, which he had received from his late brother, was itself based on a 1609 document extending the colony’s reach westward to the South Sea, and north and west to the Great Lakes and beyond.1 Washington had mapped and surveyed the Ohio Country for the shareholders at age sixteen, taking care to note for future personal reference what constituted its most valuable lands. As a young and physically robust member of the Virginia gentry, Washington was a natural participant in the imperial thrust west.","['1752', 'age sixteen']",washington personal patriotic interest wrest ohio country french indian ally brother lawrence ’s early death 1752 washington inherit substantial share ohio company joint stock company elite northern virginia gentry see western country great speculative real estate bonanza man virginia lieutenant governor william dinwiddie agitate london time assert strongly virginia ’s claim ohio country half century long confrontation britain france imperial control north america washington ’s claim virginia ’s western land receive late brother base 1609 document extend colony ’s reach westward south sea north west great lake beyond.1 washington map survey ohio country shareholder age sixteen take care note future personal reference constitute valuable land young physically robust member virginia gentry washington natural participant imperial thrust west,117,[1752],1752,1,1775,1800
2,"Although Washington eagerly sought new wealth in the western lands, he hardly was impoverished before that endeavor. He had inherited approximately two hundred slaves and ten thousand acres of land in Virginia along the Potomac River after his father’s death in 1743. Yet the diminished fertility of the soil, exhausted by a century of tobacco cultivation, meant that Washington would need to find new sources of wealth if he hoped to realize his ambition to rise to the top of the Virginia economic and cultural elite. The defeat of the French and Indians in the name of Virginia and the British Empire would redound immensely to his personal benefit. Like his late father and brother, Washington saw military service, notwithstanding its hazards, as the surest path to political and economic success.","['1743', 'a century']",washington eagerly seek new wealth western land hardly impoverished endeavor inherit approximately slave thousand acre land virginia potomac river father ’s death 1743 diminished fertility soil exhaust century tobacco cultivation mean washington need find new source wealth hop realize ambition rise virginia economic cultural elite defeat french indians virginia british empire redound immensely personal benefit like late father brother washington see military service notwithstanding hazard sure path political economic success,70,[1743],1743,1,1750,1750
3,"Knowing that the attack on Lieutenant Jumonville’s force would generate a strong response, Washington and his force dug in at Great Meadows. There he ordered his men to build a small stockade, which he named Fort Necessity, chiefly as protection for his gunpowder supplies. Refusing to assume a position exposed to enemy fire from the surrounding forest, Tanaghrisson and his followers soon departed, leaving Washington and several dozen largely inexperienced Virginia conscripts to confront a few French-Canadians and a much larger number of their Native American allies. On July 3 the enemy attacked, hiding behind the trees as they fired down on Washington’s troops, who made easy targets in the shallow rifle pits surrounding the stockade. Making matters worse, rising streams from torrential summer rains soon flooded the low-lying fort and its trenches, making the soldiers’ flintlock muskets inoperable and resistance thereby impossible. After the deaths of about thirty of his men, Washington surrendered on July 3, 1754. In the aftermath, the French commander (and brother of the slain Jumonville) graciously spared Washington’s life, allowing him and his men to return to Virginia after Washington signed a confession acknowledging his responsibility for the “assassination” of Jumonville and swearing never to return.","['July 3', 'torrential summer', 'July 3, 1754']",know attack lieutenant jumonville ’s force generate strong response washington force dig great meadow order man build small stockade name fort necessity chiefly protection gunpowder supply refuse assume position expose enemy fire surround forest tanaghrisson follower soon depart leave washington dozen largely inexperienced virginia conscript confront french canadians large number native ally july 3 enemy attack hide tree fire washington ’s troop easy target shallow rifle pit surround stockade make matter bad rise stream torrential summer rain soon flood low lie fort trench make soldiers’ flintlock musket inoperable resistance impossible death thirty man washington surrender july 3 1754 aftermath french commander brother slay jumonville graciously spar washington ’s life allow man return virginia washington sign confession acknowledge responsibility “ assassination ” jumonville swear return,124,[1754],1754,1,1775,1800
4," George Washington’s botched mission to western Pennsylvania provided the spark that reignited the Anglo-French-Indian war in North America, which by 1756 had become a global conflagration known internationally as the Great War for the Empire. By any measure, it was an inauspicious beginning to a military career. Through his experience with Tanaghrisson he had learned of the hazards of entangling alliances. In spite of his failure, Washington emerged from the incident with undiminished confidence in his abilities. In a letter to his brother Jack, he wrote of the assault on Fort Necessity in rapturous terms, noting that he had “heard bulletts [sic] whistle … and there was something charming in the sound.”2 Paradoxically, Washington’s reputation soared in the wake of the failed expedition, thanks in large part to the publication in June 1754 of a stirring memoir of his trip to the Ohio Country the previous winter. Washington later repudiated his signed confession to the execution of Jumonville, blaming his interpreter for a faulty translation of the French in the original document.","['1756', 'June 1754', 'the previous winter']",george washington ’s botched mission western pennsylvania provide spark reignite anglo french indian war north america 1756 global conflagration know internationally great war empire measure inauspicious beginning military career experience tanaghrisson learn hazard entangle alliance spite failure washington emerge incident undiminished confidence ability letter brother jack write assault fort necessity rapturous term note “ hear bullett sic whistle … charming sound.”2 paradoxically washington ’s reputation soar wake fail expedition thank large publication june 1754 stirring memoir trip ohio country previous winter washington later repudiate sign confession execution jumonville blame interpreter faulty translation french original document,95,"[1756, 1754]",1755,2,1775,1800
5,"The defeat of the Virginia regiment on the Ohio frontier provoked a strong response from the British government. It had desired to reescalate the ongoing war with France, and yet the humiliation of the Virginians seemed to require a strong response lest the power and prestige of the whole British Empire be called into question. At the instigation of the duke of Cumberland – son of George II and architect of the scorched earth policy that had laid waste to Scotland after the defeat of Bonnie Prince Charlie and his Scots rebels at Culloden in 1742 – an imposing invasion force was gathered. In May 1755, General Edward Braddock and two regiments of the elite Coldstream Guards marched into a newly constructed stockade built on a bluff on the Potomac River near Will’s Creek that Braddock named Fort Cumberland, in honor of his patron the duke of Cumberland. There Braddock and his troops, aided by colonial militias and Native American allies, prepared for an assault on the French forces and their Native American allies at Fort Duquesne, about one hundred miles to the west. Brushing off the failures of the Virginia militiamen, British officials confidently expected that a few French soldiers and their Indian allies would be no match for battle-hardened British regular troops.","['1742 –', 'May 1755']",defeat virginia regiment ohio frontier provoke strong response british government desire reescalate ongoing war france humiliation virginians require strong response lest power prestige british empire call question instigation duke cumberland – son george ii architect scorched earth policy lay waste scotland defeat bonnie prince charlie scots rebel culloden 1742 – impose invasion force gather 1755 general edward braddock regiment elite coldstream guard march newly construct stockade build bluff potomac river near ’s creek braddock name fort cumberland honor patron duke cumberland braddock troop aid colonial militia native ally prepare assault french force native ally fort duquesne mile west brush failure virginia militiaman british official confidently expect french soldier indian ally match battle harden british regular troop,116,"[1742, 1755]",1748,2,1750,1750
6,"Washington eagerly embraced another attempt to expand the Anglo-American Empire into the Ohio Country, notwithstanding his signed pledge not to return there. He had a substantial personal stake in the outcome of the battle to control the region. He envisioned an all-water route to Ohio via the Potomac River, conveniently passing by his Virginia estate at Alexandria, which he anticipated would become a key entrepôt for goods moving both upriver and down. Later in life he would become a vigorous proponent of the construction of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, a waterway running parallel to the Potomac River designed to transport goods upriver in the days before steam power. (Remnants of that canal survive today, repurposed as a hiking and walking trail.) Washington speculated in western lands, eventually owning more than sixty thousand acres west of the mountains, making him one of the largest absentee landowners of his time.3 He keenly understood that “[l]and is the most permanent estate and the most likely to increase in value.”4Thus in 1755 he joined Braddock’s expedition as an adjutant and guide, anticipating the advantages a successful expansionist thrust west would give to the British Empire, his home colony of Virginia, and to his own personal reputation and fortune. In this regard, Fred Anderson notes that Washington was “an advocate of empire long before he became the hero of a revolution.”5","['the days', 'today', '1755']",washington eagerly embrace attempt expand anglo empire ohio country notwithstanding sign pledge return substantial personal stake outcome battle control region envision water route ohio potomac river conveniently pass virginia estate alexandria anticipate key entrepôt good move upriver later life vigorous proponent construction chesapeake ohio canal waterway run parallel potomac river design transport good upriver day steam power remnant canal survive today repurpos hiking walking trail washington speculate western land eventually own thousand acre west mountain make large absentee landowner time.3 keenly understand “ l]and permanent estate likely increase value.”4thus 1755 join braddock ’s expedition adjutant guide anticipate advantage successful expansionist thrust west british empire home colony virginia personal reputation fortune regard fred anderson note washington “ advocate empire long hero revolution.”5,121,[1755],1755,1,1775,1800
7,"Joining Washington in Braddock’s imperial enterprise was Benjamin Franklin, marking the first time that the trajectories of the two men crossed. Like Washington, Franklin was a zealous imperialist who aimed to remove the Native American and French enemies blocking the migration of Pennsylvanians, Virginians, New Yorkers, and other Anglo-Americans into the seemingly limitless territories west of the Appalachian Mountains. Since the late 1740s Franklin had devoted a substantial portion of his considerable energies to the cause of colonial union, which he believed essential for westward expansion, colonial security, colonial prosperity, and his own speculative success in western lands. The previous summer at Albany he had almost single-handedly turned a congress of northern colonies aimed at strengthening the fraying Anglo-American alliance with the Six Nations of the Iroquois confederacy into a de facto constitutional convention, securing passage of a colonial Plan of Union that created a central governing authority with the power to tax and entrusted with handling expansion and security concerns. The congregants resolved unanimously “[t]hat an [sic] union of the colonies is absolutely necessary for their preservation.”6 Yet the colonial legislatures, lacking the looming threat of Indian attacks that had helped to spur passage of the plan in Albany, were much less eager to join a colonial union. The absence of an immediate security threat, combined with intracolonial rivalries and a zealous determination of local elites not to give up one iota of local autonomy to a distant central government, doomed the plan to defeat. Indeed, in most of the colonies it was never formally considered. In London, where Franklin hoped that Parliament would impose the plan of union on the colonists, the scheme was received skeptically and quietly shelved. Long-standing British fears of creating a colonial union that might someday slip the leash of imperial control prevented consideration of what might have been a transformative move for the history of the British Empire.","['the late 1740s', 'The previous summer']",join washington braddock ’s imperial enterprise benjamin franklin mark time trajectory man cross like washington franklin zealous imperialist aim remove native french enemy block migration pennsylvanian virginian new yorker anglo american seemingly limitless territory west appalachian mountain late 1740 franklin devote substantial portion considerable energy because colonial union believe essential westward expansion colonial security colonial prosperity speculative success western land previous summer albany single handedly turn congress northern colony aim strengthen fray anglo alliance nation iroquois confederacy de facto constitutional convention secure passage colonial plan union create central governing authority power tax entrust handle expansion security concern congregant resolve unanimously “ t]hat sic union colony absolutely necessary preservation.”6 colonial legislature lack loom threat indian attack help spur passage plan albany eager join colonial union absence immediate security threat combine intracolonial rivalry zealous determination local elite iota local autonomy distant central government doom plan defeat colony formally consider london franklin hop parliament impose plan union colonist scheme receive skeptically quietly shelve long stand british fear create colonial union someday slip leash imperial control prevent consideration transformative history british empire,178,[1740],1740,1,1750,1750
8,"Rejection by both colonial legislatures and by Parliament did not quash Franklin’s dream of union. He had first conceived of it in the 1740s. After making himself independently wealthy via his various printing and publishing enterprises, Franklin retired from active participation in private business and devoted himself to two main tasks: first, gaining a better understanding of the mysterious force known as electricity and, second, facilitating the expansion of British North America west of the Appalachian Mountains. In a series of published works, Franklin began to evolve a powerful vision regarding the future both of the North American colonies and of the British Empire. He first gave expression to this vision in “Plain Truth, or Serious Considerations on the Present State of the City of Philadelphia and Province of Pennsylvania” (1747). In it, he voiced concerns that Philadelphia was isolated and vulnerable to attack. The solution was for the colonies to unite for common defense. “At present we are like the separate Filaments of Flax before the Thread is form’d, without Strength, because without Connection; but UNION would make us strong, and even formidable.”7","['the 1740s', '1747']",rejection colonial legislature parliament quash franklin ’s dream union conceive 1740s make independently wealthy printing publishing enterprise franklin retire active participation private business devote main task gain good understanding mysterious force know electricity second facilitate expansion british north america west appalachian mountain series publish work franklin begin evolve powerful vision future north colony british empire give expression vision “ plain truth consideration present state city philadelphia province pennsylvania ” 1747 voice concern philadelphia isolate vulnerable attack solution colony unite common defense “ present like separate filament flax thread form’d strength connection union strong formidable.”7,94,"[1740, 1747]",1744,2,1750,1750
9,"A more famous statement of his vision appeared in “Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind,” written in 1751 but not published until 1754. In it, he imagined the British North American colonies formed into one imposing union along a rapidly expanding western frontier. Franklin’s awareness of the opportunities available as a result of North America’s favorable geography is at the heart of his argument. The abundance of land and other forms of economic opportunity in North America would lead to the proliferation of large families and a consequent doubling of the population approximately every twenty years, something Franklin termed “the American multiplication table.” Access to the lands west of the mountains and the limitless opportunity it represented would result in earlier marriages and larger families than was the case in England, where a shortage of tillable soil limited growth. Only with sufficient living room could the prosperity of the coastal regions be maintained and extended. Franklin conceived a vision of a fast-growing, rapidly expanding domain that would be the embodiment of human freedom, political justice, and material progress. “Observations on the Increase of Mankind” remains, in the words of Gerald Stourzh, “the first conscious and comprehensive formulation of ‘Manifest Destiny.’”8","['1751', '1754', 'approximately every twenty years']",famous statement vision appear “ observation concern increase mankind ” write 1751 publish 1754 imagine british north colony form impose union rapidly expand western frontier franklin ’s awareness opportunity available result north america ’s favorable geography heart argument abundance land form economic opportunity north america lead proliferation large family consequent doubling population approximately year franklin term “ multiplication table ” access land west mountain limitless opportunity represent result early marriage large family case england shortage tillable soil limited growth sufficient living room prosperity coastal region maintain extend franklin conceive vision fast grow rapidly expand domain embodiment human freedom political justice material progress “ observation increase mankind ” remain word gerald stourzh “ conscious comprehensive formulation ‘ manifest destiny.’”8,118,"[1751, 1754]",1752,2,1775,1800
10,"Franklin further elaborated his vision regarding the advantages of colonial union in “Plan for Settling Two Western Colonies,” written apparently sometime in 1754 and forwarded to the duke of Cumberland in 1756. In it, Franklin described the Ohio Country as being well known as “one of the finest in North America” and absolutely essential for the future prosperity of the colonies in that “our people … cannot much more increase in number” east of the mountains, a startling claim when one recalls there were only about 2.5 million white colonists at that time. The future was found in Ohio, and if the French were to win it permanently, it would block westward expansion, thereby “preventing our obtaining new subsistence by cultivating new lands … discourag[ing] our marriages, and keep[ing] our people from increasing; thus (if the expression may be allowed) killing thousands of our children before they are born.” He argued, “If two strong colonies of English” were settled in the Ohio Country they would provide security from attack and check the “dreaded junction of the French settlements in Canada, with those in Louisiana …”9 In short, Franklin envisioned western expansion as a way for the colonies to escape being encircled by the Gallic menace. As was stated at the Albany Congress, “[I]t seems absolutely necessary that Speedy and Effectual measures be taken to Secure the Colonies from the Slavery they are threatened with.”10 Significant, too, is Franklin’s recommendation that the western land claims of the colonies (some of which extended to the Pacific Ocean) be curtailed in the name of practicality: “A single old colony does not seem strong enough to extend itself…. it cannot venture a settlement far distant from the main body, being unable to support it. But if the colonies were united … they might easily, by their joint force, establish one or more new colonies, whenever they should judge it necessary or advantageous to the interests of the whole.”11 As Gerald Stourzh observes regarding the text, “Expansion for defense and expansion for its own sake are merged into one powerful case for the immediate settlement of the western country.”12","['1754', '1756']",franklin elaborate vision advantage colonial union “ plan settle western colony ” write apparently 1754 forward duke cumberland 1756 franklin describe ohio country know “ fine north america ” absolutely essential future prosperity colony people … increase number ” east mountain startling claim recall 2.5 million white colonist time future find ohio french win permanently block westward expansion “ prevent obtain new subsistence cultivate new land … discourag[ marriage keep[ing people increase expression allow kill thousand child bear argue “ strong colony english ” settle ohio country provide security attack check “ dread junction french settlement canada louisiana … ” 9 short franklin envision western expansion way colony escape encircle gallic menace state albany congress “ i]t absolutely necessary speedy effectual measure take secure colony slavery threaten with.”10 significant franklin ’s recommendation western land claim colony extend pacific ocean curtail practicality “ single old colony strong extend … venture settlement far distant main body unable support colony united … easily joint force establish new colony judge necessary advantageous interest whole.”11 gerald stourzh observe text “ expansion defense expansion sake merge powerful case immediate settlement western country.”12,186,"[1754, 1756]",1755,2,1775,1800
11,"To be realized, Franklin’s vision of an expanding British North American empire required a colonial union. This seemed so crystal clear to Franklin that he could not grasp why many colonists resisted it. Such is the fate of the visionary. This sentiment found its most famous expression in a letter he wrote to fellow unionist James Parker in 1751, in which Franklin laments the resistance of the colonists to the idea of union while noting the effectiveness and longevity of the Six Nations Confederacy: “It would be a very strange Thing, if six Nations of ignorant Savages should be capable of forming a Scheme for such an Union, and be able to execute it in such a Manner, as that it has subsisted Ages, and appears indissoluble; and yet that a like Union should be impracticable for ten or a dozen English Colonies, to whom it is more necessary, and must be more advantageous; and who cannot be supposed to want an equal understanding of their Interests.”13 The lesson Franklin learned from the example of the Six Nations Confederacy was not about “democracy,” as is sometimes asserted by contemporary scholars, but rather about the importance of union to the establishment of the imperial control of North America.",['1751'],realize franklin ’s vision expand british north empire require colonial union crystal clear franklin grasp colonist resist fate visionary sentiment find famous expression letter write fellow unionist jame parker 1751 franklin lament resistance colonist idea union note effectiveness longevity nation confederacy “ strange thing nation ignorant savage capable form scheme union able execute manner subsist age appear indissoluble like union impracticable dozen english colony necessary advantageous suppose want equal understanding interests.”13 lesson franklin learn example nation confederacy “ democracy ” assert contemporary scholar importance union establishment imperial control north america,90,[1751],1751,1,1775,1800
12,"Perhaps the most radical aspect of Franklin’s vision was his conception of an emerging parity between England and the colonies. He proposed that the colonists be treated as equals to citizens of the mother country, candidly admitting in a letter to Peter Collinson in May 1754, “May I presume to whisper my Sentiments in a private Letter? Britain and her Colonies should be considered as one Whole, and not as different States with separate interests.”14 Over time, Franklin saw the colonies not only as a source of raw materials and agricultural products, as had been the case until then, but also as a burgeoning market for British manufactures. In 1760, he wrote to the Scottish philosopher Lord Kames, “I have long been of the opinion that the foundations of the future grandeur and stability of the British Empire lie in America.”15 He would spend nearly twenty years trying to realize this vision of Anglo-American equality, only to find his plea for equality of treatment rejected as it concerned both the colonists and him personally.","['May 1754', 'May', '1760', 'nearly twenty years']",radical aspect franklin ’s vision conception emerge parity england colony propose colonist treat equal citizen mother country candidly admit letter peter collinson 1754 presume whisper sentiment private letter britain colony consider different state separate interests.”14 time franklin see colony source raw material agricultural product case burgeon market british manufacture 1760 write scottish philosopher lord kame “ long opinion foundation future grandeur stability british empire lie america.”15 spend nearly year try realize vision anglo equality find plea equality treatment reject concern colonist personally,82,"[1754, 1760]",1757,2,1775,1800
13,"Educating and guiding public opinion were crucial to gaining that support. One of his most famous efforts in this regard occurred in May 1754, the same month that Washington made his foray into western Pennsylvania. In response to news of the French capture of a British garrison on the Forks of the Ohio, Franklin published in his newspaper the Pennsylvania Gazette the woodcut image of a snake, chopped into multiple pieces, each with the name of a colony on it, under the caption “Join or Die.” Reputed to be the first political cartoon in American history, it remains one of the most famous. Widely circulated at the time, the image and its pointed caption is one of the first to connect the concept of colonial union with collective security. Some colonial papers suggested another advantage of union by bracketing the motto “Join or Die” with another: “Unite and Conquer.”","['May 1754', 'the same month']",educate guide public opinion crucial gain support famous effort regard occur 1754 month washington foray western pennsylvania response news french capture british garrison fork ohio franklin publish newspaper pennsylvania gazette woodcut image snake chop multiple piece colony caption “ join die ” repute political cartoon history remain famous widely circulate time image pointed caption connect concept colonial union collective security colonial paper suggest advantage union bracket motto “ join die ” “ unite conquer,74,[1754],1754,1,1775,1800
14,"Washington’s and Franklin’s efforts to spur unity suggest that the move toward the creation of an American union is best understood as a “grasstips” movement, conceived and implemented by an elite group of patriarchs appropriately known as the Founding Fathers. Franklin and Washington loomed above all others in this group, one a medicine-man prophet, the second a charismatic war chief who reveled in battle and who believed that bullets could not kill him. In Franklin, the incipient union had a visionary who, struck by lightning once during his kite experiments of 1749, was struck by lightning a second time in the form of a persistent vision of the boundless possibilities represented by colonial union: the creation of a new society unlike any that had preceded it, and of the vast western domain he offered a limitless lebensraum for what he anticipated would be the union’s rapidly multiplying millions. Franklin grasped better than anyone else that if the enormous energies, enormous wealth, and enormous potential of the thirteen colonies could be harnessed and directed toward a common end by a strong central authority, there would be no foreseeable limit as to what they might accomplish. If Franklin’s dream of colonial unity in the name of collective security and collective advantage bore some similarity to a quixotic attempt to catch lightning in a bottle, it also was analogous to a major innovation of its time, the steam engine. For a political union, in a steam engine–like fashion, aimed to harness and direct the enormous potential energies of the British North American colonies, promising to transform the political world in much the same way as the steam engine would transform the economic world. Gerald Stourzh concludes, “Franklin strove for the security, prosperity, and expansion of the British Empire. This was his concept of America’s interest.”16 Security, prosperity, and expansion also were the chief motives behind Franklin’s subsequent efforts to create a union; indeed, they served as the prime motives for virtually all who came to advocate colonial union. But for most colonists, the costs of autonomy within a union outweighed the practical advantages it offered.",['1749'],washington ’s franklin ’s effort spur unity suggest creation union best understand “ grasstip ” movement conceive implement elite group patriarch appropriately know found father franklin washington loom group medicine man prophet second charismatic war chief revel battle believe bullet kill franklin incipient union visionary strike lightning kite experiment 1749 strike lightn second time form persistent vision boundless possibility represent colonial union creation new society unlike precede vast western domain offer limitless lebensraum anticipate union ’s rapidly multiply million franklin grasp better enormous energy enormous wealth enormous potential thirteen colony harness direct common end strong central authority foreseeable limit accomplish franklin ’s dream colonial unity collective security collective advantage bear similarity quixotic attempt catch lightning bottle analogous major innovation time steam engine political union steam engine – like fashion aim harness direct enormous potential energy british north colony promise transform political world way steam engine transform economic world gerald stourzh conclude franklin strove security prosperity expansion british empire concept america ’s interest.”16 security prosperity expansion chief motif franklin ’s subsequent effort create union serve prime motif virtually come advocate colonial union colonist cost autonomy union outweigh practical advantage offer,189,[1749],1749,1,1750,1750
15,"Braddock’s expedition ended in catastrophic defeat for his forces and in his own death; he was a victim of the Indians and their French allies, his army’s inexperience, and his own arrogance. British Redcoats in classic combat formation proved no match for his foes’ guerrilla tactics. In a chaotic engagement on July 9, 1755, approximately eight hundred of the twelve hundred soldiers in Braddock’s command fell dead or wounded, most of them mistakenly shot by their own side. Braddock’s debacle in western Pennsylvania proved to be one of worst defeats in British history in North America. Yet for George Washington the battle proved crucial in establishing his credentials as the warrior-leader of the North American colonies. He was the only British officer – whose obvious symbols of rank made them conspicuous targets – to escape being killed or wounded. Once again he had been exposed to sustained deadly fire at close range and had emerged unscathed, later recounting that he “had one horse killed and two wounded under him – a ball through his hat – and several through his clothes, but escaped unhurt.”17 It was this trial by fire and others to follow that twenty years later would make him the undisputed choice to lead the Continental army. For Franklin, the defeat of a force comprised primarily of British regulars further confirmed the necessity of a centralized colonial government responsible for security and expansion on the western frontier, in particular the making of a uniform Indian policy. For both men, the Braddock disaster marked the beginning and not the end, or, more precisely, the end of the beginning, of their efforts to create a colonial union.","['July 9, 1755', 'twenty years later']",braddock ’s expedition end catastrophic defeat force death victim indians french ally army ’s inexperience arrogance british redcoat classic combat formation prove match foes’ guerrilla tactic chaotic engagement july 9 1755 approximately soldier braddock ’s command fall dead wound mistakenly shoot braddock ’s debacle western pennsylvania prove bad defeat british history north america george washington battle prove crucial establish credential warrior leader north colony british officer – obvious symbol rank conspicuous target – escape kill wound expose sustained deadly fire close range emerge unscathed later recount “ horse kill wound – ball hat – clothe escape unhurt.”17 trial fire follow year later undisputed choice lead continental army franklin defeat force comprise primarily british regular confirm necessity centralized colonial government responsible security expansion western frontier particular making uniform indian policy man braddock disaster mark beginning end precisely end beginning effort create colonial union,142,[1755],1755,1,1775,1800
16,"Had the colonies adopted the Albany Plan of Union as Franklin urged, the Indian assault might have been blunted. Certainly it offered the hope of a more coordinated colonial response. Only with the arrival of more British regular troops in 1758, and, more importantly, the adoption of a strategy to pacify and divide the Indians of the Ohio Country, was the onslaught stopped. Crafted by General Henry Bouquet, this approach aimed not so much to defeat the Indian resistance as to remove the causes of it. For a while, this brought peace to the frontier, until the blundering policies of Bouquet’s successor, Sir Jeffrey Amherst, helped precipitate in 1763 what became known as Pontiac’s Conspiracy, a pan-Indian resistance movement aimed at rejecting European ways and trade goods and expelling the British from North America. The movement is named for its war leader, an Ottawa war chief, but it was inspired by Neolin, the Delaware prophet, who, after experiencing a vision of an alternative way of being in 1760, began to call for Indian people to reject the white people’s trade goods, firearms, alcohol, and sexual license and return to their traditional ways of living. Neolin’s prophecy, inscribed in pictograph form on a hide, soon was carried to tribes all across the Ohio Country, and it was put most dramatically into effect by Pontiac and is followers, who sought to evict the British colonists and the soldiers who protected them.","['1758', '1763', '1760']",colony adopt albany plan union franklin urge indian assault blunt certainly offer hope coordinated colonial response arrival british regular troop 1758 importantly adoption strategy pacify divide indian ohio country onslaught stop craft general henry bouquet approach aim defeat indian resistance remove cause bring peace frontier blunder policy bouquet ’s successor sir jeffrey amherst help precipitate 1763 know pontiac ’s conspiracy pan indian resistance movement aim reject european way trade good expel british north america movement name war leader ottawa war chief inspire neolin delaware prophet experience vision alternative way 1760 begin indian people reject white people ’s trade good firearm alcohol sexual license return traditional way living neolin ’s prophecy inscribe pictograph form hide soon carry tribe ohio country dramatically effect pontiac follower seek evict british colonist soldier protect,129,"[1758, 1763, 1760]",1760,3,1775,1800
17,"By 1763, France had been defeated. The treaty ending the war transferred Canada and all other French claims in North America to Great Britain. But the inability of the British army to secure the area west of the mountains from Indian attacks led to the creation of the Proclamation Line of 1763. Running in a north-south direction roughly along the Appalachian crest (and extended in 1768 to the Ohio River), the Proclamation Line signified the limits of British imperial control if not the limits of their imperial claims. In the name of maintaining peace and security on the frontier, colonists were prohibited from entering the very country over which the war had been started. Yet the British government did not understand that in the name of maintaining peace with their Indian enemies they were kindling a conflict with their own colonists, who were outraged to find their expansionist ambitions now blocked by the Mother Country.","['1763', '1763', '1768']",1763 france defeat treaty end war transfer canada french claim north america great britain inability british army secure area west mountain indian attack lead creation proclamation line 1763 run north south direction roughly appalachian crest extend 1768 ohio river proclamation line signify limit british imperial control limit imperial claim maintain peace security frontier colonist prohibit enter country war start british government understand maintain peace indian enemy kindle conflict colonist outraged find expansionist ambition block mother country,76,"[1763, 1763, 1768]",1765,3,1775,1800
18,"Given the crucial role the North American colonists had played in the start and conduct of the Seven Years War, it is ironic to consider how intensely some of them denied responsibility for causing the war and for shouldering the cost of posting 10,000 British regulars in North America after the war for colonial defense. Franklin is notable in this regard. With blatant disregard for the facts of history, in 1765 he asserted to the House of Commons that the colonists had lived “in perfect peace with the French and Indians” until Braddock’s expedition, undertaken “for the profit of British merchants and manufacturers,” had provoked a crisis. Rather disingenuously, Franklin characterized the entire conflict as “really a British war.”19",['1765'],"give crucial role north colonist play start conduct seven year war ironic consider intensely deny responsibility cause war shoulder cost post 10,000 british regular north america war colonial defense franklin notable regard blatant disregard fact history 1765 assert house common colonist live “ perfect peace french indians ” braddock ’s expedition undertake “ profit british merchant manufacturer ” provoke crisis disingenuously franklin characterize entire conflict “ british war.”19",68,[1765],1765,1,1775,1800
19,"British efforts to compel obedience backfired in almost every case. The Quebec Act of 1774 placed the Ohio Country even further out of the reach of Virginia and Pennsylvania speculators by making it a part of Canada. The act also cracked down on smuggling in an attempt to reestablish and reenforce mercantile restrictions and thereby limit the commercial freedom to which the colonists had become accustomed. Given Britain’s dire financial condition in the years after the war, and considering the cost of maintaining regular troops in North America for the colonists’ protection, from today’s perspective, it does not seem outrageous that the Crown would seek to tax them. After all, the colonists had gladly received the protection of the British regulars, notwithstanding their status of being unrepresented in Parliament. Yet rational discussion of the question soon proved impossible, as the rhetoric of rights overshadowed any consideration of responsibilities when it came to colonial defense.","['1774', 'the years', 'today']",british effort compel obedience backfire case quebec act 1774 place ohio country reach virginia pennsylvania speculator make canada act crack smuggling attempt reestablish reenforce mercantile restriction limit commercial freedom colonist accustomed give britain ’s dire financial condition year war consider cost maintain regular troop north america colonists’ protection today ’s perspective outrageous crown seek tax colonist gladly receive protection british regular notwithstanding status unrepresented parliament rational discussion question soon prove impossible rhetoric right overshadow consideration responsibility come colonial defense,79,[1774],1774,1,1775,1800
20,"The financial burden of empire created a conflict over the equitable sharing of that burden, a conflict that morphed into a heated debate about the rights of man and, more fundamentally, about the role of the North American colonists in the British Empire. These were true causes of war, although it must be remembered that independence was not the only possible solution nor the one desired by a majority of the people. Yet the radicals – people such as the Adamses, Franklin, and the like – pushed for a formal separation, in the face of moderates such as Joseph Galloway of Pennsylvania, who sought a less drastic solution to the controversy. Amid rising tensions, in November 1775 the Second Continental Congress formed a Committee of Secret Correspondence to communicate with foreign governments.

21,"Franklin’s exalted place in the pantheon of American patriots sometimes obscures his circuitous route to becoming a revolutionary. He had returned to Great Britain in 1758, where he lobbied well-connected friends and members of Parliament for the imposition of a colonial union, possibly with him as its head. For years he agitated for new ways of conceiving of the North American colonies, all the while retaining a personal interest in the western lands, including a share of the so-called Walpole Company, a scheme to obtain a royal charter to 20 million acres of land – “one of the biggest land grabs in history,” as Gordon Wood terms it.20 Franklin pushed for a New World colonial union on a par with Great Britain, one imposed by Parliament once it was clear that the colonies were too fractious and too parochial to do it themselves. He went to great lengths to preserve Anglo-American unity during the building crisis, even going so far as to betray the confidence of Thomas Hutchinson, one of his best friends. Franklin was a determined unionist from 1754 onward but within the context of the British Empire. He finally joined the cause of independence in 1774, when he had run out of options and run out of credibility in Great Britain. Only then did he realize that neither he nor any American would ever be treated as equals by British society.","['1758', 'years', '1754', '1774']",franklin ’s exalted place pantheon patriot obscure circuitous route revolutionary return great britain 1758 lobby connect friend member parliament imposition colonial union possibly head year agitate new way conceive north colony retain personal interest western land include share call walpole company scheme obtain royal charter 20 million acre land – “ big land grab history ” gordon wood term it.20 franklin push new world colonial union par great britain impose parliament clear colony fractious parochial go great length preserve anglo unity building crisis go far betray confidence thomas hutchinson good friend franklin determined unionist 1754 onward context british empire finally join because independence 1774 run option run credibility great britain realize treat equal british society,115,"[1758, 1754, 1774]",1762,3,1775,1800
22,"A sense of being oppressed by a common foe began to drive the colonies closer together. Yet even as late as early 1775, the idea of a formal revolt against the British Crown was unthinkable to most colonists; indeed, it was never accepted by a majority of them. The radical faction pushing for independence – chief among them John Adams – still needed to make their case to a skeptical public, who, though opposed to arbitrary taxation, did not necessarily see a revolutionary struggle as the way to address the problem. One of the most influential voices in building support for this path was Thomas Paine and his bombshell pamphlet “Common Sense.” Arriving for the first time in America in 1774 with a letter of introduction from Franklin, whom he had known in London, Paine injected himself into the brewing political controversy with gusto. Throughout his life, he never compromised his ideals in the service of the various causes he joined. Later he would become an outspoken champion of the French Revolution (and at one point its prisoner) and an outspoken critic of organized religion. Like Franklin, Paine was a man of many talents, including the design and construction of the first steel suspension bridge. He also displayed a keen ear for the drift of popular sentiment of the time and had the ability to reflect this sentiment back in what was, for its time, a plainspoken, unadorned style. Within a year of its publication in January 1776, “Common Sense” had sold an estimated 300,000 copies, a massive figure considering that the total white population was only around three million. The pamphlet played well in the taverns and inns that functioned as local outlets in embryonic form of an emerging national news and information network. As much as and perhaps more so than his mentor Franklin, Paine was a powerful shaper of public opinion.","['early 1775', '–', '1774', 'a year', 'January 1776']","sense oppress common foe begin drive colony closer late early 1775 idea formal revolt british crown unthinkable colonist accept majority radical faction push independence – chief john adams – need case skeptical public oppose arbitrary taxation necessarily revolutionary struggle way address problem influential voice building support path thomas paine bombshell pamphlet “ common sense ” arrive time america 1774 letter introduction franklin know london paine inject brewing political controversy gusto life compromise ideal service cause join later outspoken champion french revolution point prisoner outspoken critic organized religion like franklin paine man talent include design construction steel suspension bridge display keen ear drift popular sentiment time ability reflect sentiment time plainspoken unadorned style year publication january 1776 “ common sense ” sell estimate 300,000 copy massive figure consider total white population million pamphlet play tavern inn function local outlet embryonic form emerge national news information network mentor franklin paine powerful shaper public opinion",152,"[1775, 1774, 1776]",1775,3,1800,1800
23,"The bloody battles at Lexington and Concord in April 1775 marked the beginning of a de facto war of independence for the colonies. Yet reconciliation short of a total break remained a possibility, and moderates such as Joseph Galloway of Pennsylvania worked hard for this outcome. He and others like him were opposed by the radicals, such as Paine, Franklin, and John Adams, who saw efforts at reconciliation as the enemy of their ultimate goal of independence from Great Britain. To them, Lord North’s heavy-handed response to the insurgency was a blessing because it encouraged more fence-sitters to join the cause of independence. The formal declaration of an independent “United States of America” in July 1776 was both an announcement to a “candid world” (that is to say, an unbiased one) of the new political entity as well as an internal political triumph over those who opposed a revolutionary break with Britain and a union of the colonies. Certainly the Declaration was a sort of a collective leap off a cliff, a public statement of treason that would now bind into a union the signers and the colonies in whose name they acted if only to avoid the gallows.","['April 1775', 'July 1776']",bloody battle lexington concord april 1775 mark beginning de facto war independence colony reconciliation short total break remain possibility moderate joseph galloway pennsylvania work hard outcome like oppose radical paine franklin john adams see effort reconciliation enemy ultimate goal independence great britain lord north ’s heavy handed response insurgency blessing encourage fence sitter join because independence formal declaration independent “ united state america ” july 1776 announcement “ candid world unbiased new political entity internal political triumph oppose revolutionary break britain union colony certainly declaration sort collective leap cliff public statement treason bind union signer colony act avoid gallow,99,"[1775, 1776]",1776,2,1800,1800
24,"So the Declaration announced to the world the existence of a new state having the power to make and conduct its own foreign policy. In this respect, historians are right to understand it as the cornerstone document in the history of U.S. foreign relations. However, if originally a foreign policy statement, it also constituted a manifesto of national identity that Americans would feel compelled to live up to in later years or suffer charges of hypocrisy. Its scheme of self-government based on the principle of human equality had revolutionary implications, both at home and abroad. Even before independence was declared, perceptive observers saw through the rebels’ supercharged language of liberty. The prominent English Methodist clergyman John Wesley noted this inconsistency in 1775 when he observed, “[T]he Negroes in America are slaves, the whites enjoy liberty … Is not all this outcry about liberty and slavery mere cant, and playing upon words?”27","['later years', '1775']",declaration announce world existence new state have power conduct foreign policy respect historian right understand cornerstone document history u.s foreign relation originally foreign policy statement constitute manifesto national identity american feel compel live later year suffer charge hypocrisy scheme self government base principle human equality revolutionary implication home abroad independence declare perceptive observer see rebels’ supercharged language liberty prominent english methodist clergyman john wesley note inconsistency 1775 observe “ t]he negro america slave white enjoy liberty … outcry liberty slavery mere not play words?”27,84,[1775],1775,1,1800,1800
25,"Even as the revolutionaries agitated for independence they drafted plans to engage the world as an independent state, or at least a confederation of states. Chief among these plans was the so-called Plan of Treaties (also known as the Model Treaty), printed in September 1776.

26,"John Adams, though lacking the military experience of Washington or the private sector success or scientific achievement of Franklin, nonetheless is rightfully understood as ranking very high on the list of Founding Fathers of the Union. Like Washington and Franklin, Adams early on became an advocate of colonial union and, unlike Franklin, from the start envisioned that union as a fully independent state. In 1755, at age twenty, Adams wrote to a friend that the Puritan migration of the seventeenth century might eventually “transfer the great seat of empire into America … for if we remove the turbulent Gallicks, our people … will in another century become more numerous than England itself … since we have I may say all the naval stores of the nation in our hands, it will be easy to obtain the mastery of the seas, and then the united force of all Europe will not be able to subdue us.”28","['1755', 'age twenty', 'the seventeenth century', 'another century']",john adams lack military experience washington private sector success scientific achievement franklin nonetheless rightfully understand rank high list found father union like washington franklin adam early advocate colonial union unlike franklin start envision union fully independent state 1755 age adams write friend puritan migration seventeenth century eventually “ transfer great seat empire america … remove turbulent gallick people … century numerous england … naval store nation hand easy obtain mastery sea united force europe able subdue us.”28,77,[1755],1755,1,1775,1800
27," By 1776, Adams was a committed revolutionary, and when the Continental Congress resolved in June that a draft treaty be written to serve as a template for American diplomats in the negotiation of commercial treaties with foreign states, he eagerly agreed to participate in its creation. Nominally the work of a committee of five and modified by the input of the Continental Congress, the Plan of Treaties mostly is attributable to Adams. First, Adams argued for making only commercial connections with other states and avoiding military and political ties, all in the name of avoiding foreign entanglements. Although not a formal part of the Model Treaty and disregarded in the making of the French alliance, Adams’s call for the United States to maintain only commercial ties with foreign states became a guiding assumption of American foreign relations until the 1940s. The Model Treaty did not call for “free trade” in the modern sense of removing all barriers to trade but rather aimed to challenge directly the closed mercantile system in the name of opening the markets of the world to all states. Its bold recommendations were based on the idea that the fledgling United States had cards to play in international negotiations, both as a source of raw materials and foodstuffs and as a crucial makeweight in the balance of power. Its most important aspect concerned the vision it had of U.S. commercial interests as a neutral carrier of goods on the high seas. It articulated five basic principles:","['1776', 'June', 'the 1940s']",1776 adams committed revolutionary continental congress resolve june draft treaty write serve template diplomat negotiation commercial treaty foreign state eagerly agree participate creation nominally work committee modify input continental congress plan treaty attributable adam adam argue make commercial connection state avoid military political tie avoid foreign entanglement formal model treaty disregard making french alliance adams ’s united state maintain commercial tie foreign state guide assumption foreign relation 1940 model treaty “ free trade ” modern sense remove barrier trade aim challenge directly closed mercantile system open market world state bold recommendation base idea fledgling united state card play international negotiation source raw material foodstuff crucial makeweight balance power important aspect concern vision u.s commercial interest neutral carrier good high sea articulate basic principle,123,"[1776, 1940]",1858,2,1875,1900
28,"The French government watched the American quarrel with Great Britain with great interest. Beginning in the 1760s they began to anticipate a colonial rebellion against the Mother Country and assess the benefits it might bring. By April 1776, Charles Gravier de Vergennes, minister of foreign affairs, argued for aiding the Americans in his “Considerations” presented to the king. Like all French diplomats, he burned with a desire for revenge against the British. Supplying the Americans with arms and ammunition seemed to offer the possibility of splitting the British Empire and making its former North American colonies dependent on France. He counseled the king to provide secret aid to the Americans. Finance Minister Turgot, citing France’s tenuous economic condition, argued against this, but in the end, the desire for revenge trumped the need for fiscal responsibility. The task of coordinating the transfer of this secret aid fell to the famous playwright Caron de Beaumarchais, a prominent champion of the Patriot cause. He soon began to coordinate the transfer of weapons critical to the revolution via a dummy trading company he established as a front. The British, though soon aware of this secret aid to the rebels, did not desire to force the hand of the French by publicly acknowledging it and therefore lodged no formal protest.","['the 1760s', 'April 1776']",french government watch quarrel great britain great interest begin 1760s begin anticipate colonial rebellion mother country assess benefit bring april 1776 charles gravier de vergenne minister foreign affair argue aid american “ consideration ” present king like french diplomat burn desire revenge british supply american arm ammunition offer possibility split british empire make north colony dependent france counsel king provide secret aid american finance minister turgot cite france ’s tenuous economic condition argue end desire revenge trump need fiscal responsibility task coordinate transfer secret aid fall famous playwright caron de beaumarchais prominent champion patriot because soon begin coordinate transfer weapon critical revolution dummy trading company establish british soon aware secret aid rebel desire force hand french publicly acknowledge lodge formal protest,121,"[1760, 1776]",1768,2,1775,1800
29,"In the early days of the war, the French government was not interested in a formal alliance with the rebels. The chances for the failure of the revolution were too great, with potentially negative consequences for those who had aided the insurgents. Thus when the Continental Congress dispatched Franklin in 1777 to secure a treaty of commerce and perhaps an alliance, French diplomats responded coolly and cautiously. France’s motives in supplying secret aid were clear: to weaken Great Britain. Yet at the same time, many French aristocrats and intellectuals (often one and the same) held enormous sympathy for the revolutionary cause, a sentiment Franklin artfully played to by appearing to be the archetypal New World natural man. Franklin particularly, and the Americans generally, appeared to be the perfect New World antidote to the corruptions of the ancien regime, a pastoral agricultural people without large cities and the corrosive influence of enervating luxury. Franklin, ever the master of surfaces, famously played to these sympathies by, among other things, wearing a coonskin cap at court and affecting a simplicity of manner quite at odds with the reality of his existence.","['the early days', '1777']",early day war french government interested formal alliance rebel chance failure revolution great potentially negative consequence aid insurgent continental congress dispatch franklin 1777 secure treaty commerce alliance french diplomat respond coolly cautiously france ’s motif supply secret aid clear weaken great britain time french aristocrat intellectual hold enormous sympathy revolutionary because sentiment franklin artfully play appear archetypal new world natural man franklin particularly american generally appear perfect new world antidote corruption ancien regime pastoral agricultural people large city corrosive influence enervating luxury franklin master surface famously play sympathy thing wear coonskin cap court affect simplicity manner odd reality existence,99,[1777],1777,1,1800,1800

The astounding victory at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777, where 5,000 British regulars surrendered to a patriot army under Nathanael Greene, made it clear that it was now or never. By February 1778, two agreements had been made: a Treaty of Amity and Commerce establishing trade relations between the two states; and a military alliance, to take effect in the event of formal hostilities breaking out between France and Great Britain. The Treaty of Amity and Commerce was immensely favorable to U.S. interests, containing nearly all the neutral rights clauses called for in the Model Treaty, and as such represented a spectacular diplomatic victory.","['October 1777', 'February 1778']","event ground soon force france ’s hand astounding victory battle saratoga october 1777 5,000 british regular surrender patriot army nathanael greene clear february 1778 agreement treaty amity commerce establish trade relation state military alliance effect event formal hostility break france great britain treaty amity commerce immensely favorable u.s interest contain nearly neutral right clause call model treaty represent spectacular diplomatic victory",61,"[1777, 1778]",1778,2,1800,1800
31,"The Treaty of Alliance, though essential to America’s hopes for victory, entangled the United States in European rivalries. The ink had barely dried on the treaty when France undertook to widen the conflict in an effort to limit the dimensions of the American victory, especially in the west. Notwithstanding the republican sentiments of the philosophes, the French motives in making the alliance were entirely self-interested. They hoped to break up the British North American Empire and make the fledgling United States dependent on France. Although France agreed not to reclaim any its lost territories in North America, each of the two nations pledged not to make a separate peace with the British. This became a major problem for the United States in early 1779, when, after hostilities between France and Great Britain had commenced, the French negotiated the Treaty of Aranjuez (1779) with Spain. In that pact, Spain entered the struggle in exchange for France’s commitment not to make peace until freeing Gibraltar from Great Britain and restoring it to Spain, its previous owner.

The United States found itself in the middle of a conflict involving all the major European powers, essentially a sequel to the struggle that ended in 1763, a struggle that, as we have seen, also started in North America. Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Spain all anticipated advantages from the changed geopolitical situation that would emerge at the war’s end, however it might turn out. The United States was bound by treaty to its former enemy France, which sought to limit the extent of any victory it might achieve even as it supplied large quantities of essential troops, materiel, and ships to the Patriot cause. The new union found itself deeply enmeshed in the larger geopolitical struggle. Americans generally perceived themselves as better than they generally perceived Europeans, whom they saw as politically corrupted by monarchical governments and morally dissipated by luxury. Americans were committed, in theory at least, to a new way of conducting foreign affairs, without recourse to war and secret treaties. Yet the importance of North America as perhaps the most crucial site of imperial rivalries in the world at that time rendered absurd its often-repeated desire to remain unentangled in European affairs.","['1779', 'less than thirty years', '1763']",1779 spanish effort mediate conflict break global war begin second thirty year cause north controversy united state find middle conflict involve major european power essentially sequel struggle end 1763 struggle see start north america austria prussia russia spain anticipate advantage change geopolitical situation emerge war ’s end turn united state bind treaty enemy france seek limit extent victory achieve supply large quantity essential troop materiel ship patriot because new union find deeply enmeshed large geopolitical struggle americans generally perceive good generally perceive europeans see politically corrupt monarchical government morally dissipate luxury american commit theory new way conduct foreign affair recourse war secret treaty importance north america crucial site imperial rivalry world time render absurd repeat desire remain unentangled european affair,120,"[1779, 1763]",1771,2,1775,1800

Adams’s brusque manner and uncompromising belief that America owed nothing to France for its indispensable assistance grated on the French, who soon pleaded with Congress for Adams to be replaced with someone of a more diplomatic temperament. His instructions required that before any talks could begin, Great Britain must agree to treat with the United States as a sovereign, free, and independent state.

34,"The crucial victory at Yorktown in October 1781 – made possible not only by the French army and navy on the scene but also by the French military presence in the Caribbean, which drew off British forces that might otherwise have provided reinforcements for Lord Cornwallis’s army – broke the diplomatic stalemate. In the aftermath of the capture of another British army, public and governmental opinion turned decisively against the war. Victory, even if obtainable, now seemed too costly to justify continuing the struggle. King George III, still not reconciled to submitting to the insolent colonists, nonetheless replaced Lord North and his war policy in January 1782 with Lord Rockingham, who was committed to bringing the war to a peaceful resolution even while lacking a definite plan to do so. Fortuitously for the Americans, Rockingham soon died, to be replaced as prime minister in July by Lord Shelburne, a former supporter of the war, who now, inspired by the economic theories of Adam Smith, sought both to recognize American independence and to split the United States off from its French allies by offering a generous peace. Shelburne, much like Franklin thirty years earlier, saw an expansive and populous United States as a huge potential market for British goods so long as the bad feelings engendered by the war could be put aside. His accession to power in such a timely fashion was an astounding bit of good luck for the Americans.","['October 1781 –', 'January 1782', 'July', 'thirty years earlier']",crucial victory yorktown october 1781 – possible french army navy scene french military presence caribbean draw british force provide reinforcement lord cornwallis ’s army – break diplomatic stalemate aftermath capture british army public governmental opinion turn decisively war victory obtainable costly justify continue struggle king george iii reconcile submit insolent colonist nonetheless replace lord north war policy january 1782 lord rockingham commit bring war peaceful resolution lack definite plan fortuitously american rockingham soon die replace prime minister july lord shelburne supporter war inspire economic theory adam smith seek recognize independence split united state french ally offer generous peace shelburne like franklin thirty year earlier see expansive populous united state huge potential market british good long bad feeling engender war aside accession power timely fashion astounding bit good luck american,129,"[1781, 1782]",1782,2,1800,1800
35,"Meanwhile, Franklin had begun private talks with British emissary Richard Oswald, an old friend of his sent by Rockingham to thaw the Anglo-American diplomatic deep-freeze. It soon became clear that a treaty could be made quite favorable to U.S. interests, provided Franklin was willing to disregard Congress’s instructions of June 1782, which had given Vergennes full power to make a comprehensive settlement on any terms he chose so long as they guaranteed American independence. American diplomats at this crucial time proved far more adept than one might have thought given their relative inexperience. Philosophically opposed to the concepts of Machiavelli as a guide to conduct, in practice the team of Franklin, Jay, and Adams applied these principles expertly. They did not allow a false sentimentality or unyielding devotion to principle to interfere with getting what they wanted for the United States. As was the case in the negotiation of the French alliance, the key to the U.S. diplomatic success in ending the war was remaining steadfast in favor of independence, even though they had mortgaged that independence via the negotiation of the Treaty of Alliance with France. They had pledged not to make a separate peace with Britain, as a loyal and grateful ally. Yet the American negotiators (perhaps Franklin somewhat less so) understood that French motives were entirely self-interested and therefore could not fully be trusted to act in a manner befitting an ally. For if the French wanted the colonies split off from Great Britain, they also desired that they remain geographically hemmed in and politically reliant upon France.

36,"Franklin’s terms for a settlement fell into two categories. “Necessary” conditions included (1) unconditional acknowledgment of American independence, (2) evacuation of British troops and forts along the Canadian frontier, and (3) boundaries according to Congress’s instructions of 1779, with the western limit along the Mississippi River. Conditions deemed “desirable” included (1) indemnities for destruction of Patriot property, including the liberation of slaves, (2) an Anglo-American treaty of commerce, and (3) the cession of British Canada to the United States. Given the relative weakness of the United States, Franklin’s demands, especially the desire for Canada, seem unrealistic to say the least. However, the desire of the Shelburne ministry both to end the war and to entice the Americans away from too great a reliance upon France opened the door to an astounding outcome. Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, the United States gained recognition of its independence, a western boundary along the Mississippi River from the Canadian border to the thirty-first parallel, and the right of Americans to fish the waters of the Grand Banks, the most productive fishery in the world at that time. In return, the United States (for the time being) gave up the demand for Canada, agreed not to interfere in the collection of debts owed to its British subjects, and pledged to compensate Loyalists for property seized during the war. It was an astounding achievement for a revolutionary movement whose very survival seemed doubtful as late as 1778. In the 1920s the eminent historian Samuel Flagg Bemis characterized the 1783 Treaty of Paris as “the greatest victory in the annals of American diplomacy,” an assessment that still holds true.31 Vergennes and the French were privately appalled by the way the Americans had played them, but circumstances were such as to force them into tight-lipped acquiescence with its terms. After all, they could not publicly be too disappointed at the success of their American allies.","['1779', 'as late as 1778', 'the 1920s']",franklin ’s term settlement fall category “ necessary ” condition include 1 unconditional acknowledgment independence 2 evacuation british troop fort canadian frontier 3 boundary accord congress ’s instruction 1779 western limit mississippi river condition deem “ desirable ” include 1 indemnity destruction patriot property include liberation slave 2 anglo treaty commerce 3 cession british canada united state give relative weakness united state franklin ’s demand especially desire canada unrealistic desire shelburne ministry end war entice american away great reliance france open door astounding outcome term treaty paris united state gain recognition independence western boundary mississippi river canadian border thirty parallel right american fish water grand bank productive fishery world time return united state time give demand canada agree interfere collection debt owe british subject pledge compensate loyalist property seize war astounding achievement revolutionary movement survival doubtful late 1778 1920s eminent historian samuel flagg bemis characterize 1783 treaty paris “ great victory annal diplomacy ” assessment hold true.31 vergenne french privately appal way american play circumstance force tight lipped acquiescence term publicly disappointed success ally,174,"[1779, 1778, 1920]",1826,3,1850,1850
37,"The War of Independence had dire consequences for Native Americans of the trans-Appalachian frontier. The revolt against Britain did not start the hostilities with Native Americans in the west. Violent conflicts between white settlers and Indians had been going on continually since at least 1755. However, it did greatly fan the flames of the struggle, making it difficult for Indians to remain neutral, as was the initial impulse of most of the tribes. Instead, pressure from multiple sources forced Indians to choose sides, and given the historic tension between Native American land claims and the rapacity of the settlers, it is not surprising that most tribes ultimately opposed the rebels. Since at least 1763, the British government had attempted, not always successfully, to regulate the tide and conduct of the settlers. Indeed the effort to control western immigration was one of the major causes of the breakup. Seeking to gain the loyalty of the settlers, in 1775 the Continental Congress began supplying them with soldiers and supplies for use against the British and their Indian allies.","['at least 1755', '1775']",war independence dire consequence native american trans appalachian frontier revolt britain start hostility native american west violent conflict white settler indians go continually 1755 greatly fan flame struggle make difficult indian remain neutral initial impulse tribe instead pressure multiple source force indians choose side give historic tension native land claim rapacity settler surprising tribe ultimately oppose rebel 1763 british government attempt successfully regulate tide conduct settler effort control western immigration major cause breakup seek gain loyalty settler 1775 continental congress begin supply soldier supply use british indian ally,88,"[1755, 1775]",1765,2,1775,1800

39,"The revolutionary faction led by Washington well understood that Indians could play a decisive role in the war with Great Britain and sought to guarantee their neutrality if not garner their active support. Nonetheless, attacks on British frontier outposts inevitably threatened the interests of their Indian allies, and therefore it is not surprising that by 1777 the United States was at war with most of the Indian tribes west of the mountains. As early as 1776, the Continental Congress had authorized a three-pronged, 5,000-man assault on the Cherokees of western North Carolina, who, at British instigation, had launched attacks on Patriot settlements in the early days of the war. In 1778, Colonel George Rogers Clark led 200 Virginia rangers on a campaign to attack Illinois, clear evidence that the revolution was about expansion as well as independence.","['1777', 'early as 1776', 'the early days', '1778']","revolutionary faction lead washington understand indians play decisive role war great britain seek guarantee neutrality garner active support nonetheless attack british frontier outpost inevitably threaten interest indian ally surprising 1777 united state war indian tribe west mountain early 1776 continental congress authorize pronged 5,000-man assault cherokee western north carolina british instigation launch attack patriot settlement early day war 1778 colonel george rogers clark lead 200 virginia ranger campaign attack illinois clear evidence revolution expansion independence",75,"[1777, 1776, 1778]",1777,3,1800,1800
40,"But the most important campaign of the war occurred in upstate New York in late 1779, after coordinated British-Loyalist-Iroquois attacks on Patriot settlements threatened to cut the united colonies in half. In an effort to smash the military might of the Six Nations (especially that of the Seneca) forever, Washington took a lead role in coordinating a three-pronged assault (the so-called Sullivan-Clinton campaign) on Seneca lands. Although the Seneca war parties retreated in the face of the American force of almost 5,000 troops, the unopposed Patriot force destroyed dozens of Indian towns and thousands of acres of crops in a systematic effort to starve the tribes into submission. The Continental army demonstrated an early and particularly brutal example of what John Grenier terms “the first way of war,” a manner of American warmaking that for the most part did not distinguish between warrior and noncombatant, young and old, or male and female, and that sought to destroy the enemy’s ability both to resist and to subsist. The ferocity of the 1779 American military campaign against the Seneca ironically legitimated a nickname given to George Washington more than a quarter-century earlier: Caunotaucarius, roughly translated as “destroyer of villages.” The term had first been applied to Washington’s great-grandfather John nearly a century earlier for his relentless assaults upon the Iroquois. Sensing a warrior lineage in the young officer whom he served as a guide, Seneca half-king Tanaghrisson had bestowed the title upon Washington as a sort of inheritance during their exploits in the Ohio Country in the 1750s.32 Now, as architect of the devastating assault on the Iroquois led by Major General John Sullivan, Washington earned his terrible sobriquet. Retreating to Canada to avoid annihilation, the tribes of the Six Nations in 1780 joined with a British/Loyalist force to invade the Mohawk Valley, laying waste to much of it, including the villages of the Oneidas, a member of the Six Nations aligned with the United States.33","['late 1779', '1779', 'nearly a century earlier', '1780']","important campaign war occur upstate new york late 1779 coordinated british loyalist iroquois attack patriot settlement threaten cut united colony half effort smash military nation especially seneca forever washington take lead role coordinate pronged assault call sullivan clinton campaign seneca land seneca war party retreat face force 5,000 troop unopposed patriot force destroy dozen indian town thousand acre crop systematic effort starve tribe submission continental army demonstrate early particularly brutal example john grenier term “ way war ” manner warmaking distinguish warrior noncombatant young old male female seek destroy enemy ’s ability resist subsist ferocity 1779 military campaign seneca ironically legitimate nickname give george washington quarter century earlier caunotaucarius roughly translate “ destroyer village ” term apply washington ’s great grandfather john nearly century earlier relentless assault iroquois sense warrior lineage young officer serve guide seneca half king tanaghrisson bestow title washington sort inheritance exploit ohio country 1750s.32 architect devastating assault iroquois lead major general john sullivan washington earn terrible sobriquet retreat canada avoid annihilation tribe nation 1780 join british loyalist force invade mohawk valley lay waste include village oneidas member nation align united states.33",185,"[1779, 1779, 1780]",1779,3,1800,1800
41,"By 1779, most of the Indian tribes from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico had united in opposition to the United States. Since at least the 1740s, intertribal unity had been the key factor in countering the expansion of the Anglo-Americans. Prior to 1775, it was the Indians who had used the advantages of unity to blunt the advance of the Anglo-Americans. This period of unity peaked during the revolution and after: Gregory Dowd writes, “From the final years of the Revolution through the critical engagements of 1794, the Indians of the trans-Appalachian borderlands trained their guns with more consistency, more unity, and more consequence than did any other Indians in the history of the United States.”34 Yet this courageous attempt by Native Americans to unify in the name of maintaining their independence now confronted an even more imposing unity, the new United States of America, inspired by a visionary prophet and led by a charismatic war chief. This new, more powerful North American Union would spell the Indians’ doom in only a few years’ time.","['1779', 'at least the 1740s', 'Prior to 1775', 'the final years of the Revolution', '1794']",1779 indian tribe great lake gulf mexico unite opposition united state 1740s intertribal unity key factor counter expansion anglo american prior 1775 indians advantage unity blunt advance anglo american period unity peak revolution gregory dowd write “ final year revolution critical engagement 1794 indian trans appalachian borderland train gun consistency unity consequence indian history united states.”34 courageous attempt native american unify maintain independence confront imposing unity new united state america inspire visionary prophet lead charismatic war chief new powerful north union spell indians’ doom years’ time,86,"[1779, 1740, 1775, 1794]",1772,4,1775,1800
42,"During the years prior to the revolution, religious and scholarly opinion often argued for a special role for the emerging American state. The 1771 poem “America,” by Yale graduate Timothy Dwight, mapped a trajectory of national greatness, originating in Columbus’s arrival in the New World and evolving into a blessed freedom destined to expand a Christian imperium to the far corners of the world – “the last and brightest empire of time.” Similarly, Philip Freneau’s Princeton commencement poem “The Rising Glory of America” (1771) predicted that a “new Jerusalem sent down from heav’n” would emerge in North America. In their work, both Dwight and Freneau presumed to see the hand of God in the inevitable westward movement of civilization and the destiny of the British North American colonies as the future center of world civilization.","['the years', '1771', '1771']",year prior revolution religious scholarly opinion argue special role emerge state 1771 poem “ america ” yale graduate timothy dwight map trajectory national greatness originate columbus ’s arrival new world evolve bless freedom destine expand christian imperium far corner world – “ bright empire time ” similarly philip freneau ’s princeton commencement poem “ rise glory america ” 1771 predict “ new jerusalem send heav’n ” emerge north america work dwight freneau presume hand god inevitable westward movement civilization destiny british north colony future center world civilization,87,"[1771, 1771]",1771,2,1775,1800
43,"Victory over Great Britain brought forth a wave of proto-nationalist literature, much of it emerging from the nation’s few institutions of higher learning. To key members of the educated elite, the near-miraculous defeat of the strongest nation on earth seemed a visible manifestation of God’s favor for the United States. Among the most widely disseminated productions of this sort was “The United States Elevated to Glory and Honour” (1783) by Ezra Stiles, president of Yale. Originally delivered as a sermon, Stiles’s exegesis of politics and history saw the United States as “God’s American Israel” whose destiny was to redeem humanity. Echoing Franklin, Stiles pointed to the “accelerated multiplication” of the American people as “a reason to expect that this will become a great people.” He predicted that at some future time the collective wisdom and learning of Americans “may reblaze back from America to Europe, Asia, and Africa, and illumine the world with TRUTH and LIBERTY.”1Joel Barlow’s epic poem “Columbiad” (1809) is only the best known of a lifetime of work by a writer who devoted himself to heralding the future greatness of America. Jedidiah Morse’s American Geography (1789) combined the first attempt at a comprehensive mapping of the new nation with an eschatological map that firmly located the Americans as a chosen people with a mission to redeem the world in their image. David Ramsay’s The History of the American Revolution (1789) portrayed the political developments of the struggle both as in the tradition of classical republicanism and as a sign of providential favor. All of these authors framed American history both as a critical chapter in world history and as evidence of a divine plan.","['1809', '1789', '1789']",victory great britain bring forth wave proto nationalist literature emerge nation ’s institution high learning key member educate elite near miraculous defeat strong nation earth visible manifestation god ’s favor united state widely disseminate production sort “ united state elevate glory honour 1783 ezra stile president yale originally deliver sermon stile ’s exegesis politic history see united state “ god ’ israel ” destiny redeem humanity echo franklin stile point “ accelerated multiplication ” people “ reason expect great people predict future time collective wisdom learning american “ reblaze america europe asia africa illumine world truth liberty.”1joel barlow ’s epic poem “ columbiad 1809 best know lifetime work writer devote herald future greatness america jedidiah morse ’s geography 1789 combine attempt comprehensive mapping new nation eschatological map firmly locate american choose people mission redeem world image david ramsay ’ history revolution 1789 portray political development struggle tradition classical republicanism sign providential favor author frame history critical chapter world history evidence divine plan,162,"[1809, 1789, 1789]",1796,3,1800,1800
44,"In spite of the outpouring of triumphalist literature in the years after 1783, the survival and success of the United States were by no means assured. The immediate postwar period found the United States facing imposing challenges, both domestic and foreign, which threatened to shatter the unity essential to the nation’s future. The most serious of these foreign challenges was Great Britain’s refusal to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Paris. Lord Shelburne’s astounding generosity at the negotiating table now spawned a backlash by those in the British government determined to punish the rebellious colonists. The complex document ending the war offered numerous opportunities to claim a breach. Arguing (with some merit) that U.S. state courts were not equitably settling the claims of British creditors and Loyalists, the new ministry of William Pitt the Younger took several steps back from the treaty. First, the British refused to evacuate seven forts along the Canadian border, cheering Britain’s Indian allies in the area and leaving the entire northern frontier effectively beyond American control. Second, the British declined to pay compensation for the approximately three thousand black slaves who had fled with the British army at the end of the war, most of them having been liberated in the West Indies. Third and perhaps most importantly, the British refused to negotiate a commercial treaty guaranteeing equality of treatment for U.S. merchants. Instead, Parliament enacted discriminatory regulations against American shipping, requiring that British vessels carry all commerce to the lucrative British West Indies. In spite of the discriminatory treatment, Pitt’s government considered American retaliation unlikely given that under the Articles of Confederation each state made its own commercial policy, thereby making concerted action difficult if not impossible. Less fearful now than formerly of a Franco-American alignment, the British sought not to conciliate the United States but to subordinate it into a quasi-colonial role.",['the years after 1783'],spite outpouring triumphalist literature year 1783 survival success united state mean assure immediate postwar period find united state face impose challenge domestic foreign threaten shatter unity essential nation ’s future foreign challenge great britain ’s refusal abide term treaty paris lord shelburne ’s astounding generosity negotiating table spawn backlash british government determine punish rebellious colonist complex document end war offer numerous opportunity claim breach argue merit u.s state court equitably settle claim british creditor loyalist new ministry william pitt young take step treaty british refuse evacuate seven fort canadian border cheer britain ’s indian ally area leave entire northern frontier effectively control second british decline pay compensation approximately thousand black slave flee british army end war have liberate west indie importantly british refuse negotiate commercial treaty guarantee equality treatment u.s merchant instead parliament enact discriminatory regulation shipping require british vessel carry commerce lucrative british west indie spite discriminatory treatment pitt ’s government consider retaliation unlikely give article confederation state commercial policy make concerted action difficult impossible fearful franco alignment british seek conciliate united state subordinate quasi colonial role,178,[1783],1783,1,1800,1800
45,"Uncertainty loomed large in the Southwest, where control of the Mississippi River, and ultimately the loyalty of the people living within its reach, threatened national unity. Spain contested the western boundary granted the United States by the Treaty of Paris, affirming control of the eastern bank of the river and denying Americans the freedom to navigate on its waters. Sovereignty over the entire lower Mississippi watershed remained contested throughout the decade. American settlers in the region, the so-called men of the western waters, personified the acquisitive capitalist ethos of the new nation, so much so that their loyalty to their own economic interest outweighed their loyalty to the United States. This made the Confederation Congress reluctant to do anything that might further diminish their allegiance and push them toward Spain. The national government, though fundamentally allied with the expansionist tendency that had in part prompted its creation, nonetheless sought an orderly process of imperial expansion that would limit conflict by keeping settlers from encroaching on Native American lands protected by treaty. In many ways it was the same challenge faced by the British government in the years after 1763, and it created similar sorts of resentments by frontiersmen eager to acquire new lands without regard to treaty obligations.","['the decade', 'the years after 1763']",uncertainty loom large southwest control mississippi river ultimately loyalty people live reach threaten national unity spain contest western boundary grant united state treaty paris affirm control eastern bank river deny american freedom navigate water sovereignty entire low mississippi watershed remain contested decade settler region call man western water personify acquisitive capitalist ethos new nation loyalty economic interest outweigh loyalty united state confederation congress reluctant diminish allegiance push spain national government fundamentally ally expansionist tendency prompt creation nonetheless seek orderly process imperial expansion limit conflict keep settler encroach native land protect treaty way challenge face british government year 1763 create similar sort resentment frontiersman eager acquire new land regard treaty obligation,110,[1763],1763,1,1775,1800
46,"As had been the case in Ohio and would be true elsewhere in the future, land speculators drove expansion into the southwestern frontier. The search for the next great opportunity to make an easy fortune proved irresistible. As Arthur Preston Whitaker put it, “The importance of the land speculator in the history of western expansion in the United States … can hardly be exaggerated.”2 Seeking to exploit the secessionist tendencies of American settlers, Spain adopted a policy that encouraged them to settle in the colony of Louisiana and allowed use of the Mississippi River, for a fee, beginning in 1788. Madrid extended a grant of religious toleration to the mostly Protestant settlers and made them subjects of the Spanish king. In spite of these concessions, the frontiersmen retained a near-mystical sense of loyalty, not so much to a government or to a leader, but to the idea of Anglo liberal capitalism. So long as the federal government did not do anything to damage their interests (such as concede navigation rights to the Mississippi for twenty-five years, as John Jay provisionally did in the unratified Jay-Gardoqui Treaty of 1785), the secessionist threat remained minimal. Spain had reconquered the Floridas during the war and retained nominal control of the Mississippi, including access to New Orleans. This meant an inevitable confrontation at some future time with the United States. Yet in the 1780s the fractious, lawless, go-for-broke acquisitiveness of the settlers posed the greatest threat to stability on the Mississippi frontier. It proved far more threatening to Spain than did the actions of the federal government. Whatever limits the Confederation Congress sought to place on the expansionist tendency in the name of justice and stability were contemptuously disregarded. Whitaker writes, “Grimly [the settlers] drove the Indians out before them, and exploited natural resources, slaves, and public offices, trampling down with pitiless determination every obstacle to prosperity.”3","['1788', 'twenty-five years', '1785', 'the 1780s']",case ohio true future land speculator drive expansion southwestern frontier search great opportunity easy fortune prove irresistible arthur preston whitaker “ importance land speculator history western expansion united state … hardly exaggerated.”2 seek exploit secessionist tendency settler spain adopt policy encourage settle colony louisiana allow use mississippi river fee begin 1788 madrid extend grant religious toleration protestant settler subject spanish king spite concession frontiersman retain near mystical sense loyalty government leader idea anglo liberal capitalism long federal government damage interest concede navigation right mississippi year john jay provisionally unratified jay gardoqui treaty 1785 secessionist threat remain minimal spain reconquer florida war retain nominal control mississippi include access new orlean mean inevitable confrontation future time united state 1780 fractious lawless broke acquisitiveness settler pose great threat stability mississippi frontier prove far threatening spain action federal government limit confederation congress seek place expansionist tendency justice stability contemptuously disregard whitaker write “ grimly settler drive indians exploit natural resource slave public office trample pitiless determination obstacle prosperity.”3,164,"[1788, 1785, 1780]",1784,3,1800,1800
47,"The challenges posed by Great Britain and Spain, though serious, ultimately proved less threatening to the United States than the ongoing resistance of Native American tribes along the western frontier. In spite of numerous campaigns waged against them during the War of Independence, Senecas, Shawnees, Miamis, Cherokees, Creeks, and others remained unvanquished, and they emerged more unified than ever in the war’s aftermath. Their betrayal in the Treaty of Paris of 1783 stung a bit less when the British opted not to evacuate the forts (and the critical link to arms and other supplies that they represented) as had been agreed. Shawnee raids in Kentucky and Ohio in 1784 had prevented George Washington from visiting his claims along the Great Kanawha River in the course of his continued quest for an all-river route west. In spite of the Treaty of Paris, Indian resistance never really stopped at war’s end, and by 1786 it had reemerged with renewed fury. Continuing Indian resistance demonstrated what a tenuous grasp the victorious rebels had on the western frontier. The Ohio Country stood unconquered. The Americans had gained the British imperial claim to the west by treaty; it remained unclear whether they could subjugate the natives who still claimed it as their own. Richard Butler, in charge of Indian affairs in the Northern Department, summarized the situation in a 1787 letter to Secretary of War Henry Knox: He warned that Native Americans had formed “a general confederacy among themselves from North to South in order to become formidable, and as far as they are capable of being bound to each other, I believe they are.”4 The Union now confronted another union comprised of Native Americans, one that seemed capable of stemming the expansionist tide, particularly if it could continue to receive British support.","['1783', '1784', '1786', '1787']",challenge pose great britain spain ultimately prove threatening united state ongoing resistance native tribe western frontier spite numerous campaign wag war independence senecas shawnee miamis cherokee creek remain unvanquished emerge unified war ’s aftermath betrayal treaty paris 1783 sting bit british opt evacuate fort critical link arm supply represent agree shawnee raid kentucky ohio 1784 prevent george washington visit claim great kanawha river course continue quest river route west spite treaty paris indian resistance stop war ’s end 1786 reemerg renew fury continue indian resistance demonstrate tenuous grasp victorious rebel western frontier ohio country stand unconquered american gain british imperial claim west treaty remain unclear subjugate native claim richard butler charge indian affair northern department summarize situation 1787 letter secretary war henry knox warn native american form “ general confederacy north south order formidable far capable bind believe are.”4 union confront union comprise native american capable stem expansionist tide particularly continue receive british support,154,"[1783, 1784, 1786, 1787]",1785,4,1800,1800

49,"In one crucial area, however, the Confederation Congress had been given substantial responsibility: control of the western lands. In order to head off future conflicts between individual states over western land claims, the articles entrusted control of those territories to the Congress. Controversy over this very question had held up final ratification of the articles until 1781. Historians judge the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 (successor legislation to the Land Acts of 1784 and 1785) as the most significant achievement of the Confederation Congress. It provided a blueprint for imperial expansion into land stretching from the Ohio River to the Great Lakes, a territory larger than the original thirteen states. Based on the anticolonial principle that new states would enter the Union as coequals, it allowed settlers to form their own governments and established a path to statehood, including the surveying of the land into township grids, each six miles square. Fred Anderson, perhaps the most astute scholar of the legislation, writes, “[T]he Northwest Ordinance established an empire capable of indefinite expansion because it was conceived as a league of self-governing republics, immune to the possibility of despotic rule from the center because (unlike the British empire) it was ultimately a voluntary association….

Yet the new government of 1789 remained a mystery in terms of the extent of its powers and the impact it would have on American life. As it happened, the original plan proved quite flexible under a doctrine of implied powers countenanced by the president and energetically pushed by Hamilton, his most relied upon assistant.",['1789'],inaugural address washington join chorus thank god assistance people “ step advance character independent nation distinguish token providential agency.”20 popular fear centralized tyrannical authority somewhat muted washington ’s role president new government 1789 remain mystery term extent power impact life happen original plan prove flexible doctrine imply power countenance president energetically push hamilton rely assistant,55,[1789],1789,1,1800,1800
54,"One of Hamilton’s first contributions at Treasury proved one of his most enduring: the recommendations contained in his “Report on Public Credit,” presented to Congress in January 1790. It was a master financial plan for the new government, a complex scheme in which all the parts combined to make a coherent whole. Assumption of the Revolutionary War debts of the states formed the core of the plan. Hamilton proposed that the national government pay them off, along with the war debts incurred by the Confederation Congress, at their original value. Expectations that this debt would not be repaid had led bondholders to sell them at a fraction of their face value. Hamilton recognized that for the new national government to assume the entire national debt and begin to make good on the obligation would do more than anything else to legitimate it in the eyes of the financial community, especially the European banking community. Hamilton understood that an appropriately sized and serviced national debt would energize the entire American economy by allowing the bonds to serve as collateral for private transactions. A creditworthy government would be a stable government. To facilitate handling of the debt, he proposed a national bank formed from both public and private funds that would ease the borrowing of money for public purposes such as the raising of an army. He devised an excise tax on distilled spirits to provide a dedicated stream of revenue to pay the debt. In sum, Hamilton laid the foundations of a fiscal-military state modeled very much along the lines of that of Great Britain.22 Nothing could have been better calculated to solidify the new government and prepare it to act with vigor on the world stage.",['January 1790'],hamilton ’s contribution treasury prove enduring recommendation contain “ report public credit ” present congress january 1790 master financial plan new government complex scheme part combine coherent assumption revolutionary war debt state form core plan hamilton propose national government pay war debt incur confederation congress original value expectation debt repay lead bondholder sell fraction face value hamilton recognize new national government assume entire national debt begin good obligation legitimate eye financial community especially european banking community hamilton understand appropriately sized service national debt energize entire economy allow bond serve collateral private transaction creditworthy government stable government facilitate handling debt propose national bank form public private fund ease borrowing money public purpose raising army devise excise tax distilled spirit provide dedicated stream revenue pay debt sum hamilton lay foundation fiscal military state model line great britain.22 better calculate solidify new government prepare act vigor world stage,145,[1790],1790,1,1800,1800

The first summer of the new regime saw the fall of the Bastille in July 1789, heralding the onset of the French Revolution. It is one of history’s great ironies that the European government whose support made possible American independence, itself fell victim to revolutionary violence in no small measure owing to the debts incurred during the American war.","['The first summer', 'July 1789']",administration congress seek install apparatus create foreign policy challenge face nation proliferate intensify summer new regime see fall bastille july 1789 herald onset french revolution history ’s great irony european government support possible independence fall victim revolutionary violence small measure owe debt incur war,44,[1789],1789,1,1800,1800
56,The execution of the royal couple in 1793 and the continent-wide war that soon followed complicated the U.S. response to the upheaval. The historic loathing that marked the Anglo-French rivalry worsened with the introduction of a revolutionary and ideological dimension to the struggle. Great Britain now saw itself fighting not only to preserve its own national interest but also to defend the monarchical status quo against a state that sought to overthrow God as well as the king.,['1793'],execution royal couple 1793 continent wide war soon follow complicated u.s response upheaval historic loathing mark anglo french rivalry worsen introduction revolutionary ideological dimension struggle great britain see fight preserve national interest defend monarchical status quo state seek overthrow god king,41,[1793],1793,1,1800,1800
57,"In the short run, the Washington administration faced two key questions: First, how should the United States respond to the French Revolution? Second, did the treaties of commerce and alliance of 1778 remain in force? Although both Secretary of State Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Hamilton agreed that the United States should remain neutral, they differed on the nature of that neutrality. Jefferson proposed a biased neutrality tilted toward France, both out of ideological sympathy for the revolutionaries and out of gratitude for France’s past support. Hamilton just as vehemently argued for an evenhanded neutrality based neither on sympathy nor gratitude but rather on a hardheaded assessment of U.S. national interest, which, in his (and Washington’s) mind, required the maintenance of peace until such time as the new government could be stabilized and a strong military (especially a navy) could be built.",['1778'],short run washington administration face key question united state respond french revolution second treaty commerce alliance 1778 remain force secretary state jefferson treasury secretary hamilton agree united state remain neutral differ nature neutrality jefferson propose biased neutrality tilt france ideological sympathy revolutionary gratitude france ’s past support hamilton vehemently argue evenhanded neutrality base sympathy gratitude hardheaded assessment u.s national interest washington ’s mind require maintenance peace time new government stabilize strong military especially navy build,75,[1778],1778,1,1800,1800
58,"After much deliberation, in April 1793 Washington issued a Proclamation of Neutrality, notwithstanding the fact that he had no explicit authority as president to do so. The first neutrality proclamation in the modern world, the statement became a critical precedent for presidential handling of future foreign crises. Once again Hamilton’s views had triumphed in the mind of the president. But neutrality did not mean uninvolvement in the struggle. Americans did not let concerns about the French revolutionary experiment prevent them from attempting to profit from the European war. However, they did not anticipate the refusal of the European states to allow them to trade unhindered in vital supplies with their mortal enemies. The British, especially, vigorously opposed American commercial vessels’ trading with their enemies. Between 1793 and 1796, hundreds of American ships were taken as prizes on the high seas and their cargoes seized. In spite of these outrages, the enormous profits of the wartime trade led shipowners to react to the seizures as merely a cost of doing business, increasing their insurance coverage and raising their prices to absorb the added costs.","['April 1793', 'Between 1793 and 1796']",deliberation april 1793 washington issue proclamation neutrality notwithstanding fact explicit authority president neutrality proclamation modern world statement critical precedent presidential handling future foreign crisis hamilton ’s view triumph mind president neutrality mean uninvolvement struggle american let concern french revolutionary experiment prevent attempt profit european war anticipate refusal european state allow trade unhindered vital supply mortal enemy british especially vigorously oppose commercial vessels’ trade enemy 1793 1796 hundred ship take prize high sea cargo seize spite outrage enormous profit wartime trade lead shipowner react seizure merely cost business increase insurance coverage raise price absorb add cost,95,[1793],1793,1,1800,1800
59,"James Madison had been pushing for commercial discrimination against British imports since 1791 as part of an effort to reduce U.S. commercial dependence on that nation. The ship seizures broadened support for action. Congress responded to the provocations by clamping a sixty-day embargo on all American shipping in April 1794, aiming primarily at exports to Britain. This action threatened to undermine the Anglo-American trade nexus vital to national prosperity: During this period of the 1790s, England supplied approximately 90 percent of U.S. imports and absorbed 50 percent of its exports. Faced with a congressional challenge to executive control of foreign affairs, Washington, with the Senate’s approval, dispatched John Jay to London to negotiate an end to Anglo-American differences, hoping to head off congressional efforts at commercial discrimination. The controversy over the agreement he returned with proved to be one of the first great foreign policy debates under the new Constitution and established a critical precedent for resolving future disputes between Congress and the executive branch.","['1791', 'sixty-day', 'April 1794', 'this period of the 1790s']",james madison push commercial discrimination british import 1791 effort reduce u.s commercial dependence nation ship seizure broaden support action congress respond provocation clamp day embargo shipping april 1794 aim primarily export britain action threaten undermine anglo trade nexus vital national prosperity period 1790s england supply approximately 90 percent u.s import absorb 50 percent export face congressional challenge executive control foreign affair washington senate ’s approval dispatch john jay london negotiate end anglo difference hop head congressional effort commercial discrimination controversy agreement return prove great foreign policy debate new constitution establish critical precedent resolve future dispute congress executive branch,98,"[1791, 1794, 1790]",1792,3,1800,1800
60,"Facing challenges to their economic interests on the high seas, Americans also confronted an ongoing war with the Indians on the western frontier, especially in the Ohio Country. Nearly forty years of warfare had failed to vanquish the tribes of that region; indeed, by 1790 resistance by Native Americans continued seemingly as strong as ever in spite of the decimation of their numbers by war, disease, and upheaval. The Ohio War, little known in U.S. history, took approximately five-sixths of the federal budget between 1790 and 1795. Initial efforts to deploy the power of the national government met with failure. In October 1790, Brigadier General Josiah Harmar and 1,400 regular troops and militia suffered a disastrous defeat near present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana. This fiasco was soon followed by an even bigger defeat. In November 1791 an army of Miami, Shawnee, and Delaware warriors led by Little Turtle annihilated a poorly trained and poorly led force commanded by Arthur St Clair. Approximately 940 of St. Clair’s 1,400 soldiers were killed or wounded, the worst defeat ever suffered by the United States at the hands of the Indians and rivaling that of the Braddock disaster of nearly forty years earlier.","['Nearly forty years', '1790', 'between 1790 and 1795', 'October 1790', 'present-day', 'November 1791', 'nearly forty years earlier']","face challenge economic interest high sea americans confront ongoing war indians western frontier especially ohio country nearly year warfare fail vanquish tribe region 1790 resistance native american continue seemingly strong spite decimation number war disease upheaval ohio war little known u.s history take approximately sixth federal budget 1790 1795 initial effort deploy power national government meet failure october 1790 brigadier general josiah harmar 1,400 regular troop militia suffer disastrous defeat near present day fort wayne indiana fiasco soon follow big defeat november 1791 army miami shawnee delaware warrior lead little turtle annihilate poorly train poorly lead force command arthur st clair approximately 940 st clair ’s 1,400 soldier kill wound bad defeat suffer united state hand indians rival braddock disaster nearly year earlier",123,"[1790, 1790, 1791]",1790,3,1800,1800
61,"Washington and Secretary of War Henry Knox recognized that the difficulties on the western frontier were largely the fault of white settlers who would not be constrained by treaties negotiated with the Indians. Nonetheless, the two men took strong measures to affirm U.S. sovereignty in Ohio. In the aftermath of St. Clair’s defeat, Knox reconstituted the army as the Legion of the United States, comprised of 5,000 regular troops and led by Revolutionary War hero “Mad” Anthony Wayne. In August 1794 a portion of this disciplined and determined force engaged approximately 1,000 Indian warriors in what became known as the Battle of Fallen Timbers, so called because the conflict took place in the tangled remnants of thousands of fallen trees likely downed by a tornado. Although the battle ended in a draw militarily, the retreat of the Indian force left the Americans in control of the region. Wayne’s army then proceeded to destroy every Indian village and every Indian crop field in the vicinity, exposing the tribes to starvation when their British allies, fearing American retaliation, refused to aid them. Indian resistance in Ohio finally came to an end in August 1795 with the signing of the Treaty of Greenville, in which the Native Americans of the region surrendered their claims to most of the Ohio Country once and for all. More than that, the treaty sought to impress upon the Indians that the United States was now the imperial power on whom their continued existence depended and to whom they should offer their cooperation and submission. The historian Fred Anderson writes, “Voluntary submission to the authority of the federal government was what Washington sought above all on the frontier, and it was crucial that it came as much from whites as from Indians. When Wayne cut roads through the forest, built and manned forts, defeated hostile warriors and bid defiance to the British, he made the most convincing possible demonstration of the power of the United States government.”23","['August 1794', 'an end in', 'August 1795']","washington secretary war henry knox recognize difficulty western frontier largely fault white settler constrain treaty negotiate indians nonetheless man take strong measure affirm u.s sovereignty ohio aftermath st clair ’s defeat knox reconstitute army legion united state comprise 5,000 regular troop lead revolutionary war hero “ mad ” anthony wayne august 1794 portion disciplined determine force engage approximately 1,000 indian warrior know battle fall timber call conflict take place tangle remnant thousand fall tree likely down tornado battle end draw militarily retreat indian force leave american control region wayne ’s army proceed destroy indian village indian crop field vicinity expose tribe starvation british ally fear retaliation refuse aid indian resistance ohio finally come end august 1795 signing treaty greenville native american region surrender claim ohio country treaty seek impress indians united state imperial power continue existence depend offer cooperation submission historian fred anderson write “ voluntary submission authority federal government washington seek frontier crucial come white indian wayne cut road forest build manned fort defeat hostile warrior bid defiance british convincing possible demonstration power united state government.”23",177,"[1794, 1795]",1794,2,1800,1800
62,"Hamilton’s plans to stabilize the financial condition of the country required revenue, more revenue than could be raised via the traditional and accepted method of import tariffs. To address this shortfall Hamilton conceived of a tax on distilled spirits, a burden that fell disproportionately on farmers in the areas west of the mountains. Excise charges – traditionally the most hated of taxes – were payable only in hard currency, and western farmers found it difficult to see what benefit was derived from their payments. Hamilton’s insistence, in the name of full compliance, that federal policy require distillers to keep meticulous records of their production or face penalties aggravated local sentiments. Careful record keeping proved quite burdensome to small producers, more so than for larger operations accustomed to regular accounting procedures. By 1793, the reviled tax had inspired uprisings all along the western frontier. Later known as the Whiskey Rebellion, essentially a sequel to Shays’s Rebellion of a few years earlier, it proved the largest internal uprising in the United States before the Civil War. Producers refused to pay the excise; tax collectors fell victim to mob violence when not being routinely harassed. The uprising directly challenged the authority of the new government. The revolt symbolized an existential threat to the new central authority: A government incapable of exercising authority over its own citizens could hardly expect respect on the world stage. British officials in North America saw the revolt as a manifestation of the inherently centrifugal tendencies of the not-so-united states and eagerly anticipated its collapse.24","['1793', 'a few years earlier']",hamilton ’s plan stabilize financial condition country require revenue revenue raise traditional accepted method import tariff address shortfall hamilton conceive tax distilled spirit burden fall disproportionately farmer area west mountain excise charge – traditionally hat tax – payable hard currency western farmer find difficult benefit derive payment hamilton ’s insistence compliance federal policy require distiller meticulous record production face penalty aggravate local sentiment careful record keeping prove burdensome small producer large operation accustom regular accounting procedure 1793 revile tax inspire uprising western frontier later know whiskey rebellion essentially sequel shay ’s rebellion year earlier prove large internal uprising united state civil war producer refuse pay excise tax collector fall victim mob violence routinely harass uprising directly challenge authority new government revolt symbolize existential threat new central authority government incapable exercise authority citizen hardly expect respect world stage british official north america see revolt manifestation inherently centrifugal tendency unite state eagerly anticipate collapse.24,152,[1793],1793,1,1800,1800
63,"Both Washington and Hamilton recognized the need for the incipient uprising to be decisively put down in the name of asserting the authority of the central government. The president also had personal reasons for securing the western country: For forty years he had accumulated property claims totaling more than sixty thousand acres west of the Appalachians. He had no desire to see either the Union dismembered or his land claims nullified by a secessionist tendency.25 In August 1794, Washington declared western Pennsylvania to be in revolt and federalized militia from New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. Washington personally oversaw the reconstitution of the officer corps. In September 1794, a force of nearly 13,000 troops with Washington at its head rendezvoused at Fort Cumberland, the same place where he and Braddock had started their ill-fated expedition forty years earlier. From there the army marched toward western Pennsylvania to crush the rebels. The ragtag collection of locals disbanded in the face of an overwhelming federal force marching west, thereby avoiding a violent confrontation. Several leaders of the rebellion suffered arrest and the charge of treason, but soon even they were released without severe penalty. Harsh measures proved unnecessary; the massive show of force decisively affirmed the authority of the national government. Washington’s personal investment in western lands also benefited from the government’s strong action, increasing approximately 50 percent in value after the defeat of the rebellion. And while the massive display of force did not necessarily assure the loyalties of Americans west of the mountains, it did, as Thomas Slaughter notes, “demonstrate the federal government’s commitment to a perpetual Union and its ability to enforce that commitment hundreds of miles distant from the center of its power.”26","['forty years', 'August 1794', 'September 1794', 'forty years earlier']","washington hamilton recognize need incipient uprising decisively assert authority central government president personal reason secure western country year accumulate property claim total thousand acre west appalachian desire union dismember land claim nullify secessionist tendency.25 august 1794 washington declare western pennsylvania revolt federalized militia new jersey eastern pennsylvania maryland virginia washington personally oversee reconstitution officer corp september 1794 force nearly 13,000 troop washington head rendezvous fort cumberland place braddock start ill fat expedition year earlier army march western pennsylvania crush rebel ragtag collection local disband face overwhelming federal force march west avoid violent confrontation leader rebellion suffer arrest charge treason soon release severe penalty harsh measure prove unnecessary massive force decisively affirm authority national government washington ’s personal investment western land benefit government ’s strong action increase approximately 50 percent value defeat rebellion massive display force necessarily assure loyalty american west mountain thomas slaughter note “ demonstrate federal government ’s commitment perpetual union ability enforce commitment hundred mile distant center power.”26",160,"[1794, 1794]",1794,2,1800,1800
64,"Between late 1794 and early 1795, the perilous condition of the new union greatly improved. Wayne’s defeat of the Miami Confederacy in August 1794 had paved the way for the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, finally securing the Ohio Country for the United States. The crushing of the whiskey rebels in November 1794 had served notice far beyond western Pennsylvania that the new sovereignty established by the Constitution had teeth and was not to be taken lightly. That same month, Jay concluded the treaty that bears his name in London, sending it home for a hoped-for ratification by two-thirds of the Senate.","['Between late 1794 and early 1795', 'August 1794', '1795', 'November 1794']",late 1794 early 1795 perilous condition new union greatly improve wayne ’s defeat miami confederacy august 1794 pave way treaty greenville 1795 finally secure ohio country united state crushing whiskey rebel november 1794 serve notice far western pennsylvania new sovereignty establish constitution tooth take lightly month jay conclude treaty bear london send home hop ratification third senate,57,"[1794, 1795, 1794]",1794,3,1800,1800
65,"Armed with Hamilton’s peace-at-any-cost instructions, Jay, an Anglophile, had minimal difficulty reaching an agreement with British officials. While the treaty was not wholly unfavorable to the United States, the British refused to budge on the maritime questions at the heart of the controversy. The pact allowed renewed access for Americans to the British West Indies but only in vessels of seventy tons or smaller, a distinct disadvantage. Rather than face the criticism of what many would see as capitulation, Washington withheld the treaty from the public; the Senate debated and ratified it in June 1795 by 20–10, a bare two-thirds majority – and only then by removing the limitations on American commercial access to the British West Indies. Before the president could sign the ratified treaty a leaked copy found its way into press, igniting a firestorm of controversy that scholars point to as the first significant partisan debate of the emerging two-party system. As had been feared, members of the emerging Jeffersonian faction viewed it as craven submission to Great Britain and a betrayal of France. The Democratic-Republican societies that sprang up at this time in opposition to the treaty represent the origins of the first oppositional party in U.S. history.","['June 1795', '–']",arm hamilton ’s peace cost instruction jay anglophile minimal difficulty reach agreement british official treaty wholly unfavorable united state british refuse budge maritime question heart controversy pact allow renew access american british west indie vessel seventy ton small distinct disadvantage face criticism capitulation washington withhold treaty public senate debate ratify june 1795 20–10 bare third majority – remove limitation commercial access british west indie president sign ratified treaty leak copy find way press ignite firestorm controversy scholar point significant partisan debate emerge party system fear member emerge jeffersonian faction view craven submission great britain betrayal france democratic republican society spring time opposition treaty represent origin oppositional party u.s history,109,[1795],1795,1,1800,1800
66,"Washington’s signature on the treaty in August 1795 should have marked the end of the battle. But members of the Jeffersonian clique, having whipped themselves into a fever pitch about the dire consequences that allegedly would follow, attempted to stop the treaty by refusing to vote funds for its implementation. In an effort to discredit the treaty, they also demanded that the executive branch turn over all documents and correspondence relating to its negotiation. This move represented a bold attempt by the House to gain some measure of control of the foreign policy process. As with the debate over the Constitution, a solid majority of citizens seemed to oppose the treaty. Washington responded cagily, waiting six months for passions to cool before requesting implementation funds and flatly refusing to share any documents relating to its negotiation as an intrusion on executive privilege. Hamilton, by now a private citizen, produced another blizzard of articles (under the pseudonym Camillus) defending the treaty as essential to the national interest and wearing down opponents by both the cogency and the quantity of his arguments. On April 30, 1796, the House voted 51–48 to fund the treaty. Yet passions remained inflamed. Representative Frederick Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania was stabbed and beaten by his brother-in-law for changing his vote in favor of funding the treaty, a disturbing indication of the intensity of political divisions in the country at that time.27","['August 1795', 'six months', 'April 30, 1796']",washington ’s signature treaty august 1795 mark end battle member jeffersonian clique have whip fever pitch dire consequence allegedly follow attempt stop treaty refuse vote fund implementation effort discredit treaty demand executive branch turn document correspondence relate negotiation represent bold attempt house gain measure control foreign policy process debate constitution solid majority citizen oppose treaty washington respond cagily wait month passion cool request implementation fund flatly refuse share document relate negotiation intrusion executive privilege hamilton private citizen produce blizzard article pseudonym camillus defend treaty essential national interest wear opponent cogency quantity argument april 30 1796 house vote 51–48 fund treaty passion remain inflamed representative frederick muhlenberg pennsylvania stab beat brother law change vote favor fund treaty disturbing indication intensity political division country time.27,123,"[1795, 1796]",1796,2,1800,1800

Essentially a follow-up to the treaty ending the War of Independence, the Jay Treaty served notice that the chance for a second Anglo-American war had been, for the time being, greatly reduced. This fact made Spain much more willing to deal with the Americans on the southwestern border dispute. Fears of an Anglo-American assault on Spanish Louisiana or the Floridas prompted Spanish prime minister Manuel de Godoy to capitulate to every demand of American negotiator Thomas Pinckney. In Pinckney’s Treaty (1795), the United States secured navigation rights to the Mississippi River, the right to deposit goods at New Orleans preparatory to transshipment overseas, a southern boundary at the thirty-first parallel as originally called for in the 1783 agreement with Great Britain, the withdrawal of Spanish troops from territories now owned by the United States, and a Spanish pledge (which ultimately proved hollow) to prevent Indian attacks on American settlements.","['Spanish', '1795', '1783']",critic blast jay treaty sell nation ’s commercial right honor grasp agreement ’s importance security union essentially follow treaty end war independence jay treaty serve notice chance second anglo war time greatly reduce fact spain willing deal american southwestern border dispute fear anglo assault spanish louisiana floridas prompt spanish prime minister manuel de godoy capitulate demand negotiator thomas pinckney pinckney ’s treaty 1795 united state secure navigation right mississippi river right deposit good new orlean preparatory transshipment overseas southern boundary thirty parallel originally call 1783 agreement great britain withdrawal spanish troop territory own united state spanish pledge ultimately prove hollow prevent indian attack settlement,104,"[1795, 1783]",1789,2,1800,1800

These attacks, however, did not diminish his astounding achievements as both a soldier and a citizen. From that uncertain beginning in western Pennsylvania in the early 1750s, he had literally presided over the conception, creation, and institutionalization of what was presumed to be a permanent union of Britain’s now independent North American colonies. The United States had assumed a sovereign role amid the world’s nations and had expanded prodigiously during its short existence, making real Washington’s vision of a great western Empire.

69,"The French, far more experienced than the Americans in the ways of diplomacy, knew better than to feel sincerely aggrieved. Americans made concessions to Britain at the negotiating table because their national security required it and the balance of forces compelled it. Any chance that the United States might have refrained from making the best deal it could with Britain out of a misplaced sense of gratitude to revolutionary France ended with Hamilton’s ascendance in the cabinet. Raison d’état of the sort counseled by Hamilton allowed no room for sentiment. Nonetheless, the French chose to respond to news of the Jay Treaty with the vengeance of a jilted lover. In July 1796 they announced they would no longer honor the premise of “free ships/free goods” articulated in the Treaty of 1778; by June 1797 the French navy had seized more than three hundred American vessels trading with the West Indies. A new international crisis loomed for the Americans with their former ally, led now by a revolutionary junta known as the Directory. The Directory’s insistence that the United States acquiesce in its demands to modify the commercial terms of the alliance as a precondition to receiving the new American minister, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, prompted new president John Adams to escalate the war of words in a special message to Congress. He declared to Congress that France’s high-handed treatment of the American minister “is to treat us neither as allies nor as friends, nor as a sovereign state…. Such attempts ought to be repelled with a decision which shall convince France and the world that we are not a degraded people, humiliated under a colonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority, fitted to be the miserable instruments of foreign influence.”1 Having defused tensions with the world’s most powerful state, the United States now escalated them with its second most powerful state.","['July 1796', 'June 1797']",french far experienced american way diplomacy know better feel sincerely aggrieved american concession britain negotiating table national security require balance force compel chance united state refrain make good deal britain misplaced sense gratitude revolutionary france end hamilton ’s ascendance cabinet raison d’état sort counsel hamilton allow room sentiment nonetheless french choose respond news jay treaty vengeance jilted lover july 1796 announce longer honor premise “ free ship free good ” articulate treaty 1778 june 1797 french navy seize vessel trade west indie new international crisis loom american ally lead revolutionary junta know directory directory ’s insistence united state acquiesce demand modify commercial term alliance precondition receive new minister charles cotesworth pinckney prompt new president john adams escalate war word special message congress declare congress france ’s high handed treatment minister “ treat ally friend sovereign state … attempt ought repel decision shall convince france world degrade people humiliate colonial spirit fear sense inferiority fit miserable instrument foreign influence.”1 have defuse tension world ’s powerful state united state escalate second powerful state,171,"[1796, 1797]",1796,2,1800,1800

The Sedition Act made written political dissent a crime, punishable by a fine of $2,000 or two years in jail.

72,"France, now led by Napoleon, vindicated Adams’s limited war policy by quickly agreeing to settle the dispute. The Treaty of Mortefontaine, also known as the Convention of 1800, abrogated the Franco-American Treaties of 1778 as the United States desired, although at a cost: The United States agreed to assume the claims of American merchants whose goods had been illegally seized by the French since 1793, totaling approximately $20,000,000. It was a considerable expense but, given the cost of a full-scale war, qualified as a bargain.

73,"The 1790s proved a crucial decade in American history. Domestically, the fiction of a harmonious one-party state intended by the framers of the Constitution broke down amid intense partisan acrimony, much of it related to differences over foreign affairs. The political strife precipitated the rise of the Jeffersonian Republicans and the emergence of the first party system. Resistance to the heavy-handed Alien and Sedition Acts resulted in resolutions issued by the legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky in 1798 reserving the right of the states to nullification or interposition of federal legislation deemed oppressive, carrying with them the distinct whiff of disunion. At the same time, the enormous centralization of power rendered theoretically possible by the Constitution and made real by the policies of Hamilton led to remarkable achievements in American foreign relations. In a little over a decade under the new Constitution, the United States had won a major victory over the Indians in the Ohio War, put down a serious internal rebellion in the trans-Appalachian west, secured navigation rights on the Mississippi River from Spain, stabilized both the Canadian border and trade relations with Great Britain, and escaped from an entangling alliance with France after besting that nation in a protracted, undeclared naval showdown.

The Federalist party, divided internally and widely loathed for its heavy-handed rule, set the stage for the first transfer of power to another party in American history in what historians sometimes term “the revolution of 1800.” As the undisputed head of a party in control of both houses of Congress (but not the judiciary, thanks to John Adams’s last-minute appointments to the federal bench), Jefferson had wide latitude to craft the policies of his choice. The bitter political antagonisms of the late 1790s had resulted in a new regime’s coming to power that promised to take back the American Revolution from the moneychangers and “Anglomen,” who, it was thought, had corrupted the dream.

75,"As it turned out they need not have worried. In his inaugural address (which was, like Washington’s Farewell Address, widely printed and reprinted), Jefferson signaled that the changes he would make would not be drastic and sought to bury the bitter feelings of the recent past in the warm glow of consensus: “Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle…. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists. If there be any among us who wish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety of which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.”2 Appeals to bipartisanship are enduringly popular U.S. history, but such appeals overlook the fact that partisan differences are often rooted in differing principles, particularly regarding the size and function of the national government. The new president’s appeal to unity rang a bit disingenuously given Jefferson’s significant role in drafting the Virginia Resolutions of 1798, which contained an implicitly secessionist aspect. Most observers, however, relieved at the smooth transfer of power, chose to overlook these seeming contradictions and instead hope for better times ahead.",['1798'],turn need worry inaugural address like washington ’s farewell address widely print reprint jefferson signal change drastic seek bury bitter feeling recent past warm glow consensus difference opinion difference principle … republican federalist wish dissolve union change republican form let stand undisturbed monument safety error opinion tolerate reason leave free combat it.”2 appeal bipartisanship enduringly popular u.s history appeal overlook fact partisan difference root differ principle particularly size function national government new president ’s appeal unity ring bit disingenuously give jefferson ’s significant role draft virginia resolution 1798 contain implicitly secessionist aspect observer relieve smooth transfer power choose overlook contradiction instead hope good time ahead,105,[1798],1798,1,1800,1800
76,"Given this staunch small-government stance, it is ironic that Jefferson is remembered as the most expansionist of all the Founders, more so than even Franklin or Washington. Jefferson wrote to James Monroe in 1801 of his belief that “[h]owever our present interests may restrain us within our limits, it is impossible not to look forward to distant times, when our rapid multiplication will expand it beyond these limits, & cover the whole northern if not the southern continent, with people speaking the same language, governed in similar forms, and by similar laws.”4Though he never traveled west of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, Jefferson from his earliest days had a consuming vision of the possibilities of continental expansion. He zealously advocated for American navigation rights on the Mississippi River, early on recognizing that maintaining unhindered access to the Gulf of Mexico was critical to securing the loyalty of the trans-Appalachian west. But his continentalist vision extended far beyond the Mississippi, the Lewis and Clark Expedition being only the most famous of several exploratory missions to the west sponsored by the Jefferson administration. The ostensible scientific purpose of the Lewis and Clark endeavor was joined to another, more practical, concern. Jefferson’s instructions to the two explorers called for them to explore the streams and rivers from the Missouri River west for the purpose of discovering which waterway might “offer the most direct & practicable water communication across this continent for the purposes of commerce.”5","['1801', 'his earliest days']",give staunch small government stance ironic jefferson remember expansionist founder franklin washington jefferson write james monroe 1801 belief “ h]owever present interest restrain limit impossible look forward distant time rapid multiplication expand limit cover northern southern continent people speak language govern similar form similar laws.”4though travel west blue ridge mountain virginia jefferson early day consuming vision possibility continental expansion zealously advocate navigation right mississippi river early recognize maintain unhindered access gulf mexico critical secure loyalty trans appalachian west continentalist vision extend far mississippi lewis clark expedition famous exploratory mission west sponsor jefferson administration ostensible scientific purpose lewis clark endeavor join practical concern jefferson ’s instruction explorer call explore stream river missouri river west purpose discover waterway “ offer direct practicable water communication continent purpose commerce.”5,125,[1801],1801,1,1825,1850

78,"It was against this ideological backdrop that the momentary calm on the international scene that had ushered in the Jefferson presidency gave way in the summer of 1801 to fears that Spain, in control of the Louisiana territory since it had been ceded to the Spanish crown by the French at the end of the Seven Years War, planned to “retrocede” the province back to Napoleonic France. Alarming reports suggested that a huge French expeditionary force under the command of Napoleon’s brother-in-law, General Victor Leclerc, was headed to Saint Domingue in a final effort to defeat the rebels under the command of Toussaint L’Ouverture, a former slave whose brilliant leadership had sustained the Haitian independence movement since its inception in 1791. Taken together, the reports presented a thorny challenge. Jefferson, initially sympathetic to the idea of crushing a black revolution occurring in close proximity to the United States, soon came to fear a large French expeditionary force in the Western Hemisphere even more. The administration speculated that Leclerc’s ultimate mission was to secure New Orleans and hence control of the Mississippi after the defeat of the Haitian revolutionaries. Like a recurring nightmare, the specter of western expansion being blocked once again haunted the sleep of Americans, even more so than the equally recurring dream of a slave uprising. Once again, America’s imperial ambitions entangled it in the maelstrom of European imperial intrigues even as it continued to see itself as apart and uninvolved in world affairs.","['the summer of 1801', '1791']",ideological backdrop momentary calm international scene usher jefferson presidency give way summer 1801 fear spain control louisiana territory cede spanish crown french end seven year war plan “ retrocede province napoleonic france alarming report suggest huge french expeditionary force command napoleon ’s brother law general victor leclerc head saint domingue final effort defeat rebel command toussaint l’ouverture slave brilliant leadership sustain haitian independence movement inception 1791 take report present thorny challenge jefferson initially sympathetic idea crush black revolution occur close proximity united state soon come fear large french expeditionary force western hemisphere administration speculate leclerc ’s ultimate mission secure new orlean control mississippi defeat haitian revolutionary like recur nightmare specter western expansion block haunt sleep american equally recur dream slave uprising america ’s imperial ambition entangle maelstrom european imperial intrigue continue apart uninvolved world affair,135,"[1801, 1791]",1796,2,1800,1800
79,"Jefferson, temporarily elbowing Secretary of State Madison to the side, took personal control of American diplomacy in this time of crisis. In a letter designed to become public knowledge, Jefferson in April 1802 wrote to the American minister in Paris, Robert Livingston, warning that the day France took possession of New Orleans, Americans would have to “marry themselves to the British fleet and nation.” It was a continuation of the “Mississippi question” of the 1780s, a threat both to commerce and to the Union itself. Jefferson’s inveterate Anglophobia did not prevent him from at least contemplating an alliance with Great Britain in the face of a massive expansion of French power in North America. Napoleon at first appeared unconcerned with this threat and sought to augment France’s reinvigorated New World Empire by acquiring the Floridas from Spain, too. The crisis came to a head with the closing of the port of New Orleans to American shipping by the Spanish Intendant of the city in October 1802, in direct violation of Pinckney’s Treaty. Occurring before the formal transfer of the colony to France, many Americans assumed (probably incorrectly) that Napoleon was behind the suspension of the right of deposit. For at least the third time since the adoption of the Constitution, war fever swept the nation. Congress made plans to raise an army of 80,000 militia, and settlers in Kentucky, Tennessee, and elsewhere began to make their own preparations for defense.","['April 1802', 'the 1780s', 'October 1802']","jefferson temporarily elbow secretary state madison take personal control diplomacy time crisis letter design public knowledge jefferson april 1802 write minister paris robert livingston warn day france take possession new orlean american “ marry british fleet nation ” continuation “ mississippi question ” 1780s threat commerce union jefferson ’s inveterate anglophobia prevent contemplate alliance great britain face massive expansion french power north america napoleon appear unconcerned threat seek augment france ’s reinvigorated new world empire acquire floridas spain crisis come head closing port new orlean shipping spanish intendant city october 1802 direct violation pinckney ’s treaty occur formal transfer colony france american assume probably incorrectly napoleon suspension right deposit time adoption constitution war fever sweep nation congress plan raise army 80,000 militia settler kentucky tennessee begin preparation defense",128,"[1802, 1780, 1802]",1795,3,1800,1800

By early 1803, Leclerc’s 30,000-strong army was in tatters and its general dead, a victim of the fever that had consumed many of his troops. With their demise died Napoleon’s dream of a reconstituted French New World Empire centered in New Orleans. In the wake of defeat in Sainte Domingue and contemplating a renewed struggle with the allies in Europe, Napoleon acted decisively. He instructed Talleyrand to sell all of the vaguely defined Louisiana territory to the Americans for $11 million, plus the assumption of $4 million in claims by Americans (mostly merchants) against the French government. Monroe arrived in Paris to find a radically different negotiation. Yet he and Livingston did not hesitate to disregard their instructions and to agree to Tallyrand’s astounding offer of a huge, indeterminate expanse of North America peopled by approximately 50,000 French Creoles and 150,000 Indians.

82,"However large the territory of Louisiana actually turned out to be, its acquisition presented two major constitutional challenges: first, could a president acquire new lands by treaty? Second, was it constitutional or just to incorporate non-Indian peoples into the Union without their consent? On the first point Jefferson himself had serious doubts, scuttling a hurried attempt to amend the Constitution granting him permission to purchase territories only when he feared that further delays might lead Napoleon to change his mind about the entire deal. The second objection loomed even larger. The framers of the Constitution did not authorize the colonization of a Euro-American population by presidential treaty-making power, an outright act of imperial domination. Jefferson made matters worse by depriving Louisianans, for a time, of the right to self-government, instead making himself the de facto emperor of the “Empire of Liberty” in 1805. Notwithstanding these and other objections, most notably that the massive extension of territory would eventually lead to the collapse of the Union, the Republican-dominated Senate ratified the purchase 24–7 in October 1803.","['1805', 'October 1803']",large territory louisiana actually turn acquisition present major constitutional challenge president acquire new land treaty second constitutional incorporate non indian people union consent point jefferson doubt scuttle hurried attempt amend constitution grant permission purchase territory fear delay lead napoleon change mind entire deal second objection loom large framer constitution authorize colonization euro population presidential treaty make power outright act imperial domination jefferson matter bad deprive louisianan time right self government instead make de facto emperor “ empire liberty ” 1805 notwithstanding objection notably massive extension territory eventually lead collapse union republican dominate senate ratify purchase 24–7 october 1803,98,"[1805, 1803]",1804,2,1825,1850
83,"Whatever the commercial advantages of independence as envisioned by Paine and others, the loss of the protection of the Union Jack proved a distinct disadvantage to the nation’s commercial fleet, which quickly fell prey to piratical attacks by the North African states of Morocco, Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers. Known by Americans as the Barbary Coast, for several centuries these states had terrorized shipping in the Mediterranean, compelling Europeans to pay protection monies or face seizure. Wealthy states with strong navies, such as Great Britain, found it advantageous to make the payments rather than crush the lightly armed pirates so as to leave the ships of their less-well-off commercial competitors facing capture of their vessels and enslavement of their crews. In the short run, capitulation to extortion seemed expedient. In 1786, over Jefferson’s objections, the United States agreed to make payments totaling $1 million to Morocco in return for a guarantee of safe passage for American-flagged vessels. In the late 1790s, similar payments made to Algiers totaled $1 million. The protection these payments afforded seemed to justify the national humiliation they entailed.","['several centuries', '1786', 'the late 1790s']",commercial advantage independence envision paine loss protection union jack prove distinct disadvantage nation ’s commercial fleet quickly fall prey piratical attack north african state morocco tripoli tunis algier know american barbary coast century state terrorize shipping mediterranean compel europeans pay protection monie face seizure wealthy state strong navy great britain find advantageous payment crush lightly armed pirate leave ship commercial competitor face capture vessel enslavement crew short run capitulation extortion expedient 1786 jefferson ’s objection united state agree payment total 1 million morocco return guarantee safe passage flag vessel late 1790 similar payment algier total 1 million protection payment afford justify national humiliation entail,104,"[1786, 1790]",1788,2,1800,1800
84,"As president, Jefferson faced a number of foreign policy challenges. The first was the resumption of the attacks by Tripolitan corsairs on American shipping, supposedly the result of late tribute payments to the pasha. Without asking Congress for permission, Jefferson dispatched a squadron of navy frigates to chastise Tripoli for its actions and, more generally, bring a measure of American-style freedom to the Mediterranean. Jefferson deeply resented both the fact and the idea of the United States continuing to pay tribute to the Barbary states. Although he had garnered political support by vowing to reduce the size of the Federalist navy, Jefferson did not hesitate to use some of those same ships in his attempt to make the Mediterranean safe for American commerce. Underfunded and conducted far from home, Jefferson’s Barbary War (1801–5) did not fully succeed in ending Mediterranean piracy. Although substantially more expensive in lives and money than continuing to pay tribute would have been, the campaign did enhance the security of American commercial vessels by putting the North African states on notice that piracy would be challenged. The undeclared campaign produced some stunning victories and memorable national heroes. Lieutenant Stephen Decatur turned out to be the most famous of these heroes. His 1804 stealth mission into the harbor of Tripoli to burn the USS Philadelphia, which had been taken captive along with its crew after running aground, captured the imagination of more than merely Americans. Lord Nelson, celebrated British admiral and hero of the Battle of Trafalgar, described Decatur’s exploits as the “most spectacular story of the age.” Almost as remarkable, in January 1805, a squad of seven marines and 400 mercenaries under the command of William Eaton marched five hundred miles across the Libyan desert “to the shores of Tripoli” to capture the port of Derna, part of a first effort at regime change by the United States. The capture of Derna, combined with the intense shelling of Tripoli by American naval vessels offshore, eventually did force the pasha to cut a deal freeing the hostages in exchange for $60,000 and agreeing to forgo tribute payments from the Americans. Yet it was not the last campaign against the North Africans. Algiers resumed attacks on American shipping in 1807 and continued them until defeated by U.S. naval forces in the Second Barbary War in 1815. Although mostly forgotten today, the Barbary Wars remains significant as an early step in a long-term American campaign to free the seas and a vivid early example of the emerging U.S. capacity to project power far from home.","['1804', 'January 1805', '1807', '1815', 'today']","president jefferson face number foreign policy challenge resumption attack tripolitan corsair shipping supposedly result late tribute payment pasha ask congress permission jefferson dispatch squadron navy frigate chastise tripoli action generally bring measure style freedom mediterranean jefferson deeply resent fact idea united state continue pay tribute barbary state garner political support vow reduce size federalist navy jefferson hesitate use ship attempt mediterranean safe commerce underfunded conduct far home jefferson ’s barbary war 1801–5 fully succeed end mediterranean piracy substantially expensive life money continue pay tribute campaign enhance security commercial vessel put north african state notice piracy challenge undeclared campaign produce stunning victory memorable national hero lieutenant stephen decatur turn famous hero 1804 stealth mission harbor tripoli burn uss philadelphia take captive crew run aground capture imagination merely american lord nelson celebrate british admiral hero battle trafalgar describe decatur ’s exploit “ spectacular story age ” remarkable january 1805 squad seven marine 400 mercenary command william eaton march mile libyan desert “ shore tripoli ” capture port derna effort regime change united state capture derna combine intense shelling tripoli naval vessel offshore eventually force pasha cut deal free hostage exchange 60,000 agree forgo tribute payment american campaign north african algier resume attack shipping 1807 continue defeat u.s naval force second barbary war 1815 forget today barbary war remain significant early step long term campaign free sea vivid early example emerge u.s capacity project power far home",234,"[1804, 1805, 1807, 1815]",1808,4,1825,1850
85,"The naval assault on the North African states in the name of freedom of the seas, while significant, is historically overshadowed by the lengthy, determined campaign to expand neutral rights, which ultimately resulted in the War of 1812. Once again, Americans found themselves entangled in European controversies as a result of their unquenchable thirst for big profits. Conflict had first arisen in 1793 as a direct result of the beginning of the wars of the French Revolution. At that time it had first become clear that the United States stood to profit hugely from a general European war, and equally clearly, the belligerents were not about to stand idly by while vessels with American flags trafficked with their enemy. Particularly valuable was the so-called carrying trade, the highly profitable movement of the goods of belligerent states in American vessels, effectively making them “free.” The controversy surrounding this issue had been behind Jay’s Treaty and the Quasi-War. The renewal of hostilities in Europe in May 1803 set the stage for a new round of conflict on the high seas that the United States, by far the world’s leading neutral carrier at that time, could not hope to avoid.","['1793', 'May 1803']",naval assault north african state freedom sea significant historically overshadow lengthy determine campaign expand neutral right ultimately result war 1812 american find entangled european controversy result unquenchable thirst big profit conflict arise 1793 direct result beginning war french revolution time clear united state stand profit hugely general european war equally clearly belligerent stand idly vessel flag traffic enemy particularly valuable call carrying trade highly profitable movement good belligerent state vessel effectively make “ free ” controversy surround issue jay ’s treaty quasi war renewal hostility europe 1803 set stage new round conflict high sea united state far world ’s lead neutral carrier time hope avoid,105,"[1793, 1803]",1798,2,1800,1800
86,"As was the case in the 1790s, the British denied American notions of international law as it concerned neutral rights in wartime. London was determined to maintain a system that supported its role as the world’s preeminent naval power. In particular, the British did not want neutral vessels being employed to carry goods between France and Spain and their respective colonial ports in the West Indies, a trade normally closed to neutrals in peacetime. Indeed, this prohibition of opening a colonial trade in war that was normally closed in peace was known as the Rule of the War of 1756. The Polly case of 1800 exposed a large loophole in this policy. In that decision, the British Admiralty court ruled that neutral vessels might legally carry enemy goods to enemy ports if they first stopped at a home port and unloaded their cargoes and paid import duties, effectively changing their aspect from “unfree” to “free.” The goods could then legally be reexported. American shippers eagerly exploited this technicality. The wartime reexport trade quickly proved enormously lucrative, amounting to $53 million in 1805. While the British Admiralty court had assumed that changing the nature of the goods would be so burdensome as to drain the reexport trade of its profitability, the broad requirements for a so-called broken voyage invited fraud or evasion, which occurred on a massive scale. American shippers often did not even unload the “enemy” goods in question, and port officials often reimbursed shippers for import duties if the items were reexported in a timely fashion, a practice known as “drawbacks.” Faced with this unexpected consequence of the Polly decision, in May 1805 the Admiralty court reversed itself, ruling in the Essex case that the American ship in question had not paid bona fide duties on its cargo. British Admiralty law now effectively outlawed trade between a belligerent colonial port and a neutral port. British warships assumed patrol stations outside American ports, effectively placing much of the East Coast under a blockade.","['the 1790s', '1800', '1805', 'May 1805']",case 1790s british deny notion international law concern neutral right wartime london determine maintain system support role world ’s preeminent naval power particular british want neutral vessel employ carry good france spain respective colonial port west indie trade normally close neutral peacetime prohibition open colonial trade war normally close peace know rule war 1756 polly case 1800 expose large loophole policy decision british admiralty court rule neutral vessel legally carry enemy good enemy port stop home port unload cargo pay import duty effectively change aspect “ unfree ” “ free ” good legally reexport shipper eagerly exploit technicality wartime reexport trade quickly prove enormously lucrative amount 53 million 1805 british admiralty court assume change nature good burdensome drain reexport trade profitability broad requirement call broken voyage invite fraud evasion occur massive scale shipper unload “ enemy ” good question port official reimburse shipper import duty item reexport timely fashion practice know “ drawback ” face unexpected consequence polly decision 1805 admiralty court reverse rule essex case ship question pay bona fide duty cargo british admiralty law effectively outlaw trade belligerent colonial port neutral port british warship assume patrol station outside port effectively place east coast blockade,196,"[1790, 1800, 1805, 1805]",1800,4,1825,1850
87,"The impressment of sailors from American merchant vessels proved the most controversial British action. American shippers were not innocent victims of this practice. The dire need for able-bodied sailors prompted some American ship captains to “entice” British sailors they encountered in foreign ports. By the thousands, jack-tars deserted the Royal navy and sought refuge on American merchant ships, resulting in a serious, ongoing drain for the Royal navy and a determination by ship captains to replenish their crews by any means necessary. Between 1803 and 1812, the Royal navy impressed approximately 10,000 crewmembers from American vessels – an imposing number but by no means surprising when placed next to Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin’s 1807 calculation that half of the 18,000 sailors serving in the American commercial fleet were of English nationality.","['Between 1803 and 1812', '1807']","impressment sailor merchant vessel prove controversial british action shipper innocent victim practice dire need able bodied sailor prompt ship captain “ entice ” british sailor encounter foreign port thousand jack tar desert royal navy seek refuge merchant ship result ongoing drain royal navy determination ship captain replenish crew mean necessary 1803 1812 royal navy impress approximately 10,000 crewmember vessel – impose number mean surprising place secretary treasury albert gallatin ’s 1807 calculation half 18,000 sailor serve commercial fleet english nationality",80,[1807],1807,1,1825,1850

Britain negotiated with the Jay Treaty as a starting point and sought in essence to renew it. They stuck to this position, feeling no need to compromise given the current balance of forces. The agreement the two sides reached – the so-called Monroe-Pinkney Treaty – offered little to assuage American concerns over impressment, blockades, and the carrying trade. It, like the Jay Treaty, did promise a period of lessening Anglo-American tensions. But this was not nearly enough for the Jefferson administration.

89,"Disappointment over the allegedly deficient Monroe-Pinkney Treaty led to a period of drift and uncertainty, giving circumstances a chance to take control. On June 22, 1807, the British warship HMS Leopard, patrolling the lower Chesapeake Bay, overtook and broadsided an American frigate of the same name, which was en route to the Mediterranean to take part in the Barbary War. Its crew unseasoned and its guns virtually unfired, after a brief exchange Commodore James Barron quickly surrendered the Chesapeake to the British, who searched it and seized four alleged deserters.

90,"So the saber rattling that followed the Chesapeake affair was to be expected, and this kind of thing had worked in the past to help Americans get what they wanted. In this case, however, a lack of sabers to rattle, the result of the Republican fiscal austerity campaign, made the threats less effective. The dry-docking (another Jeffersonian innovation) of half of the planned navy frigates, the reduction in the army’s size from 5,000 to 3,000 troops, and an Army officer corps notorious for nepotism and incompetence took much of the bite out of Americans’ collective snarl. The administration’s secret efforts during the summer of 1807 to mobilize 100,000 militia for a planned assault on Canada ran into intense resistance from the states, some of which expressed reluctance to cede control of their forces to the federal government. Treasury Secretary Gallatin, suddenly having to shift from a program of fiscal austerity to massive projected borrowing, found that the federal government had to compete for capital with insurance companies that had large claims to be paid related to ship and cargo seizures. Gallatin even schemed for a while to reduce government borrowing costs by artificially inflating the market value of government paper.8",['the summer of 1807'],"saber rattle follow chesapeake affair expect kind thing work past help american want case lack saber rattle result republican fiscal austerity campaign threat effective dry docking jeffersonian innovation half plan navy frigate reduction army ’s size 5,000 3,000 troop army officer corp notorious nepotism incompetence take bite americans’ collective snarl administration ’s secret effort summer 1807 mobilize 100,000 militia plan assault canada run intense resistance state express reluctance cede control force federal government treasury secretary gallatin suddenly have shift program fiscal austerity massive project borrowing find federal government compete capital insurance company large claim pay relate ship cargo seizure gallatin scheme reduce government borrowing cost artificially inflate market value government paper.8",111,[1807],1807,1,1825,1850
91,"While the Jefferson administration cast about for an effective response to the Chesapeake affair, both Britain and France continued to look for ways to stop the Americans from carrying the goods of their enemy. Locked in a battle to the death, the world’s two largest powers would now resort to any means necessary for victory. In May 1806, Britain had declared a de facto paper blockade of all the ports of Europe between Brest and the Elbe River. This made American vessels anywhere near the continent subject to search and seizure. In November, Napoleon countered by declaring a similar blockade of the British Isles, the so-called Berlin Decrees. Britain, upping the ante, issued special orders-in-council in 1807 requiring that all vessels heading to French-controlled ports anywhere in the world first submit to British inspection and pay a special tax. Once again, Napoleon countered in December 1807 with the Milan Decrees, proclaiming that any American vessel that showed signs of submitting to Britain’s policy of fees and inspections would be treated as a British ship. The hazards to neutral shipping greatly increased, as both antagonists sought ways to starve the opponent into submission. Although the restrictions of both nations placed onerous burdens on American interests, those of the British provoked the most American complaints owing to the numbers and aggressiveness of the Royal navy in confiscating cargoes and impressing seamen. The British seized roughly 60 percent of the estimated 1,500 American merchant ships seized between 1803 and 1812.","['May 1806', 'November', '1807', 'December 1807', 'between 1803 and 1812']","jefferson administration cast effective response chesapeake affair britain france continue look way stop american carry good enemy lock battle death world ’s large power resort mean necessary victory 1806 britain declare de facto paper blockade port europe brest elbe river vessel near continent subject search seizure november napoleon counter declare similar blockade british isle call berlin decree britain up ante issue special order council 1807 require vessel head french control port world submit british inspection pay special tax napoleon counter december 1807 milan decree proclaim vessel show sign submit britain ’s policy fee inspection treat british ship hazard neutral shipping greatly increase antagonist seek way starve opponent submission restriction nation place onerous burden interest british provoke complaint owe number aggressiveness royal navy confiscate cargo impress seaman british seize roughly 60 percent estimated 1,500 merchant ship seize 1803 1812",138,"[1806, 1807, 1807]",1807,3,1825,1850
92,"Jefferson and the Republicans now had to confront a European system seemingly unified in stymieing American commerce. With the military option temporarily off the table, Congress, after secret deliberations and at the administration’s urging, passed on December 22, 1807, the first of five Embargo Acts of successively increasing severity. The lawmakers aimed to cut off all American trade with the world as a means of economically coercing Britain and France into respecting neutral rights. The Jeffersonians hoped that Anglo-French efforts to starve the other into submission could be trumped by an American campaign aimed at forcing both sides into changing their policies toward neutral shipping. Harking back to the non-importation campaigns of the 1760s and 1770s, Jefferson saw the embargo as a means of bringing back the self-sacrifice and patriotism that epitomized “the Spirit of ’76.” What Jefferson termed “peaceable coercion” would use the means of withholding America’s economic bounty to the end of bending the world to its national will. When the public proved less than unanimous in its support of the embargo and looked for ways to evade it, Jefferson tightened the screws. The foreign policy power of the national government was turned inward, as the Republicans finally increased the size of the army and the navy, not to fight a foreign war but to enforce the domestic side of a foreign policy. The president seemed to acknowledge no limit in his drive to enforce the law, which, to a disturbing degree, became just another way to impose his own will on the American people and on the world. Jefferson wrote to Gallatin, “Congress must legalize all means that may be necessary to obtain its end.”9 By mid-1808, the army was being used to enforce tyranny disguised as law. Republican fears about the danger to liberty of a standing army had apparently come true.","['December 22, 1807', 'the first of', 'the 1760s and 1770s']",jefferson republicans confront european system seemingly unify stymie commerce military option temporarily table congress secret deliberation administration ’s urging pass december 22 1807 embargo act successively increase severity lawmaker aim cut trade world means economically coerce britain france respect neutral right jeffersonian hop anglo french effort starve submission trump campaign aim force side change policy neutral shipping hark non importation campaign 1760s 1770s jefferson see embargo means bring self sacrifice patriotism epitomize “ spirit ’76 ” jefferson term “ peaceable coercion ” use mean withhold america ’s economic bounty end bend world national public prove unanimous support embargo look way evade jefferson tighten screw foreign policy power national government turn inward republicans finally increase size army navy fight foreign war enforce domestic foreign policy president acknowledge limit drive enforce law disturbing degree way impose people world jefferson write gallatin “ congress legalize mean necessary obtain end.”9 mid-1808 army enforce tyranny disguise law republican fear danger liberty stand army apparently come true,161,[1807],1807,1,1825,1850
93,"It seems clear that the framers of the commerce clause giving the national government the right to regulate commerce did not imply the right to cut it off completely, but Jefferson and the Republicans did not shrink from another massive expansion of the implied powers of the national government. The embargo created widespread economic hardship and dislocation; ships rotted, and businesses went bankrupt when they could not pay debts incurred prior to the embargo; exports fell from $108 million in 1807 to $22 million in 1808. Jefferson rationalized the suffering as an opportunity to purify American society of what he saw as an excessive zeal for commerce – ironic, given the commercial motives behind the embargo. A nightmarish experiment, the embargo rendered absurd Jefferson’s promise of a government that would not impose its arbitrary will on the people.","['1807', '1808']",clear framer commerce clause give national government right regulate commerce imply right cut completely jefferson republicans shrink massive expansion imply power national government embargo create widespread economic hardship dislocation ship rot business go bankrupt pay debt incur prior embargo export fall 108 million 1807 22 million 1808 jefferson rationalize suffering opportunity purify society see excessive zeal commerce – ironic give commercial motif embargo nightmarish experiment embargo render absurd jefferson ’s promise government impose arbitrary people,75,"[1807, 1808]",1808,2,1825,1850
94,"Jefferson’s continued campaign to coerce Britain and France economically in the face of widespread evasions of the embargo by Americans culminated in January 1809 in the Fifth Embargo Act. It gave draconian powers of enforcement to the government, empowering the military to arrest individuals and to seize property without a warrant, effectively nullifying the Fourth Amendment. Goods even suspected as being intended for export could summarily be seized.

95,"The outrageous disregard for constitutional liberties embodied in the Fifth Embargo Act concerned even diehard supporters of the president’s campaign of peaceable coercion. Relentless enforcement had resulted in widespread violations of the rights of American citizens and a devastated economy, with nothing to show for it in terms of altering the behavior of either Britain or France. Once the likely failure of his policy became evident Jefferson seems to have lost interest both in it and in the presidency. He began to look forward to retiring to his estate at Monticello, where he could focus his attention on his books and on his experiments and be done with the messy world of politics. Shortly before leaving office he wrote to Du Pont de Nemours of his eagerness to return “to my family, my books, and my farms … Never did a prisoner, released from his chains, feel such relief as I shall on shaking off the shackles of power.”11 When Jefferson’s administration ended in March 1809, Congress allowed his embargo to expire with it.",['March 1809'],outrageous disregard constitutional liberty embody fifth embargo act concern diehard supporter president ’s campaign peaceable coercion relentless enforcement result widespread violation right citizen devastate economy term alter behavior britain france likely failure policy evident jefferson lose interest presidency begin look forward retire estate monticello focus attention book experiment messy world politic shortly leave office write du pont de nemours eagerness return “ family book farm … prisoner release chain feel relief shall shake shackle power.”11 jefferson ’s administration end march 1809 congress allow embargo expire,85,[1809],1809,1,1825,1850
96,"While Anglo-American relations remained in crisis, things heated up on the western imperial frontier. In 1806, Tenskwatawa, an Indian medicine man known as the Shawnee Prophet, experienced a powerful vision in which all the remaining Indian tribes east of the Mississippi River united in one last-gasp effort to roll back the advance of the American Empire onto their lands. Tenskwatawa was joined by a charismatic war chief named Tecumseh, also a Shawnee, whose inspired leadership helped foster what soon became a formidable pan-Indian resistance. This was only the most recent of a number of Indian unity movements extending back to Pontiac’s, all of them motivated by a desire to evict the American invaders and return to traditional ways of living.",['1806'],anglo relation remain crisis thing heat western imperial frontier 1806 tenskwatawa indian medicine man know shawnee prophet experience powerful vision remain indian tribe east mississippi river united gasp effort roll advance empire land tenskwatawa join charismatic war chief name tecumseh shawnee inspire leadership help foster soon formidable pan indian resistance recent number indian unity movement extend pontiac ’s motivate desire evict invader return traditional way live,66,[1806],1806,1,1825,1850
97,"Jefferson handed off the dreadful mess of his failed embargo to his faithful protégé, James Madison, who was easily elected in this era of one-party rule in spite of the political upheavals of the previous two years. Madison’s skill as a constitutional scholar did not necessarily prepare him to be a political leader, and during his tenure as secretary of state Jefferson frequently eclipsed him. Still, the foreign policy cul-de-sac created by Jefferson’s failed embargo left Madison with few moves to make short of declaring war. Neither Madison nor the country was quite ready for that. As a face-saving measure, Congress passed the Non-Intercourse Act three days before Madison assumed office. This measure reopened foreign trade with all nations except for Great Britain and France (and places controlled by them) but offered the possibility of reopening trade with one or both of the belligerents if they agreed to respect neutral rights. When British minister David Erskine pledged that London would repeal its orders-in-council so long as non-intercourse against France continued, Madison, without waiting for formal ratification of the agreement, reopened trade with Britain in June 1809. More than six hundred American ships soon departed for the British Isles filled with two years’ worth of formerly embargoed goods. To Madison’s great embarrassment, British foreign secretary Canning repudiated Erskine’s diplomacy, keeping the orders-in-council in place and welcoming the American goods en route. Whatever pressure had been accumulated on Britain by the embargo was now lost.","['this era', 'the previous two years', 'three days', 'June 1809', 'now']",jefferson hand dreadful mess fail embargo faithful protégé james madison easily elect era party rule spite political upheaval previous year madison ’s skill constitutional scholar necessarily prepare political leader tenure secretary state jefferson frequently eclipse foreign policy cul de sac create jefferson ’s fail embargo leave madison move short declare war madison country ready face save measure congress pass non intercourse act day madison assume office measure reopen foreign trade nation great britain france place control offer possibility reopen trade belligerent agree respect neutral right british minister david erskine pledge london repeal order council long non intercourse france continue madison wait formal ratification agreement reopen trade britain june 1809 ship soon depart british isle fill years’ worth embargoed good madison ’s great embarrassment british foreign secretary canning repudiate erskine ’s diplomacy keep order council place welcome good en route pressure accumulate britain embargo lose,144,[1809],1809,1,1825,1850

This anomalously named legislation reopened all foreign trade but pledged to renew non-intercourse against one of the belligerents if the other suspended its attacks on American shipping. Perhaps seeing how Britain had profited from Madison’s gullibility, Napoleon now promised repeal of the Continental System if the Americans retaliated against the British. Naïvely taking the French dictator at his word, the president dutifully closed trade with Britain and reopened it with France, only to find that Napoleon did not mean what he had said. Madison’s prestige as a leader sank even further.

99,"During the critical period of 1810–12, when effective communication and accurate information might have prevented a war, neither Britain nor the United States had effective representation in the other’s capital. A series of British diplomats, each more condescending and contentious than the last, followed David Erskine’s ignominious departure in the wake of his failed treaty bid. The legacy of bad feelings and estrangement existing between two nations that had so much in common prevented effective diplomatic communication. On the American side, after Minister William Pinkney left London in a huff in February 1811, no ministerial-level diplomat replaced him. The U.S. government lacked good intelligence as to the state of the British economy and society in the midst of total war. This failure to stay well informed as to the state of the British state and nation resulted in the Madison administration’s failure to anticipate the June 18, 1812, repeal of the offending orders-in-council. For a year and a half, a severe economic downturn, caused in part by the embargo policy, had caused bread riots by the poor and great remonstrance by manufacturers, who pleaded with Parliament to find a way to reopen access to the American market. These pressures, combined with a growing fear that the Americans might declare war if only for lack of a better strategy, prompted the British government to change course.","['February 1811', 'June 18, 1812', 'a year and a half']",critical period 1810–12 effective communication accurate information prevent war britain united state effective representation ’s capital series british diplomat condescending contentious follow david erskine ’s ignominious departure wake fail treaty bid legacy bad feeling estrangement exist nation common prevent effective diplomatic communication minister william pinkney leave london huff february 1811 ministerial level diplomat replace u.s government lack good intelligence state british economy society midst total war failure stay informed state british state nation result madison administration ’s failure anticipate june 18 1812 repeal offend order council year half severe economic downturn cause embargo policy cause bread riot poor great remonstrance manufacturer plead parliament find way reopen access market pressure combine grow fear american declare war lack good strategy prompt british government change course,123,"[1811, 1812]",1812,2,1825,1850
100,"President Madison’s message to Congress offered no immediate casus belli to justify a declaration of war. In the end the president chose war because he seemed to have run out of strategies for maintaining the peace. No one seemed to have a sure sense of what to try next. At one point an exasperated Congress nearly voted for war against both Great Britain and France. The declaration of war surprised most American citizens; the drumbeat for conflict had been nearly constant since 1805, and yet no war had been forthcoming. Now, seemingly without immediate provocation, Congress commenced hostilities by a vote split along partisan lines. J. C. A. Stagg writes that Congress’s “response to war was determined, with few exceptions, more by partisan and political considerations than by any individual or sectional attitudes toward the issues which had produced the crisis.”1Certainly one political advantage gained by Madison was to put an end to New York Federalist Dewitt Clinton’s campaign for the presidency in 1812.","['1805', '1812']",president madison ’s message congress offer immediate casus belli justify declaration war end president choose war run strategy maintain peace sure sense try point exasperated congress nearly vote war great britain france declaration war surprise citizen drumbeat conflict nearly constant 1805 war forthcoming seemingly immediate provocation congress commence hostility vote split partisan line j. c. a. stagg write congress ’s “ response war determine exception partisan political consideration individual sectional attitude issue produce crisis.”1certainly political advantage gain madison end new york federalist dewitt clinton ’s campaign presidency 1812,88,"[1805, 1812]",1808,2,1825,1850
101,"Even after so many years of delay the decision to go to war had a rushed quality about it. The repeal of the orders-in-council might not have been such a surprise had the Madison administration had better intelligence. As it was, after the departure of Minister William Pinkney in 1811, the United States had only minimal understanding of political climate in Britain. Obsessed with what they perceived to be the malevolence of Great Britain toward the United States, Republicans in general had made up their minds for war long before the actual vote. Historians have never agreed about the root cause of the war. Beginning in the 1920s, some claimed the chief motive to be an expansionist desire for Canada and Florida. More recently, historians have reemphasized the maritime issues, especially impressment as the primary cause. In this view, the indisputable ambition to conquer Canada has been seen as “defensive expansionism,” done in the name of depriving Great Britain of a source of raw materials. But a consensus as to the war’s causes remains elusive. The war occurred not because of race, nor was it about religion, and it occurred in spite of potentially thriving economic relations between the two states. This leaves the subjective concept of “honor” invoked by Madison as a cause of the war, hardly enough it seems to justify or explain full-scale hostilities unless one understands honor in this case to be a duel between the dominant power of the era and a rising challenger having the audacity to refuse subordination to the reigning hegemon. Great Britain remained determined to limit the growth of what it perceived to be a future rival, and the United States was just as determined to assert its position, at whatever the cost. The contest took place on the land, on the seas, and in the realm of ideology, where Republicans treated the contest as a test of national resolve and national identity.","['1811', 'the 1920s', 'the era']",year delay decision war rush quality repeal order council surprise madison administration good intelligence departure minister william pinkney 1811 united state minimal understanding political climate britain obsess perceive malevolence great britain united state republican general mind war long actual vote historian agree root because war begin 1920s claim chief motive expansionist desire canada florida recently historian reemphasiz maritime issue especially impressment primary because view indisputable ambition conquer canada see “ defensive expansionism ” deprive great britain source raw material consensus war ’s cause remain elusive war occur race religion occur spite potentially thrive economic relation state leave subjective concept “ honor ” invoke madison because war hardly justify explain scale hostility understand honor case duel dominant power era rise challenger have audacity refuse subordination reign hegemon great britain remain determined limit growth perceive future rival united state determine assert position cost contest take place land sea realm ideology republican treat contest test national resolve national identity,156,"[1811, 1920]",1866,2,1875,1900
102,"The congressional split over going to war mirrored that in the society. If anything, the public was even less unified for a fight than were the politicians. So great were the internal divisions over the conflict that Alan Taylor has renamed it “the Civil War of 1812.” The new struggle rekindled the Patriot-Loyalist clashes of the War of Independence, this time with many members of the Federalist party tarred as Loyalists in disguise. A June 1813 letter to the Philadelphia Aurora by “An American Farmer” captured this sentiment: “As much as the people of the two nations resemble each other in face, it is notoriously evident that there are some in America whose souls are perfectly British … It is not where a man was born or who he looks like, but what he thinks, which ought at this day to constitute the difference between an American and a British subject.”2 Taylor sees four intertwined dimensions to the Civil War of 1812: first, a struggle between Loyalists and Americans for control of the new province of Upper Canada; second, the efforts of Irish immigrants to the United States, many of them recent, to continue their ongoing struggle against British colonialism, this time in Canada under the American flag; third, the involvement of Native American tribes on both sides of the conflict, pursuing their individual agendas, often against other Indians; and fourth, an intense domestic partisanship that spilled over into outright treason as some members of the Federalist party served as spies and smugglers for the British.","['June 1813', 'this day']",congressional split go war mirror society public unified fight politician great internal division conflict alan taylor rename “ civil war 1812 ” new struggle rekindle patriot loyalist clash war independence time member federalist party tar loyalist disguise june 1813 letter philadelphia aurora “ farmer ” capture sentiment “ people nation resemble face notoriously evident america soul perfectly british … man bear look like think ought day constitute difference british subject.”2 taylor see intertwine dimension civil war 1812 struggle loyalist american control new province upper canada second effort irish immigrant united state recent continue ongoing struggle british colonialism time canada flag involvement native tribe side conflict pursue individual agenda indians fourth intense domestic partisanship spill outright treason member federalist party serve spy smuggler british,123,[1813],1813,1,1825,1850

A three-pronged invasion of Canada in 1812 failed miserably, as many of the state militias that had been federalized for the war refused to cross the border to fight. Jefferson had confidently predicted that conquering sparsely populated and lightly defended Canada would be “a mere matter of marching,” but he had not anticipated that his vaunted militia might not be willing to make the march across a foreign border in the name of imperial conquest. Moreover, Jefferson and others seriously underestimated the intense loyalty of Canadians to the Crown; many of them were the descendants of Loyalist exiles of the War of Independence.",['1812'],knowledge war 1812 turn obscure recklessness commence prosecute pronged invasion canada 1812 fail miserably state militia federalize war refuse cross border fight jefferson confidently predict conquer sparsely populated lightly defend canada “ mere matter marching ” anticipate vaunted militia willing march foreign border imperial conquest jefferson seriously underestimate intense loyalty canadian crown descendant loyalist exile war independence,57,[1812],1812,1,1825,1850
104,"The U.S. navy performed magnificently in spite of the deep cuts to naval construction and readiness done in the name of Republican economy. While the superior size of the British fleet required the Americans to focus on harassing British commerce rather than pursue large-scale naval showdowns, in numerous individual engagements with British warships over much of the Atlantic, American frigates staffed by able crews more than held their own against the number one navy in the world. Also noteworthy was the epic voyage (1812–14) of battle and plunder by Commodore David Porter at the helm of the USS Essex. Porter, in the first U.S. naval action in the Pacific Ocean, sailed the Essex far up the west coast of South America, doing an estimated $2.5 million in damages to the British whalers in the area before being captured. Major naval victories on Lake Erie in 1813 and Lake Champlain in 1814 proved decisive in the final outcome.

105,"Perhaps as much as anything, the war revealed the tensions between Republican small-government ideology and the realities of Jeffersonian foreign policy. Political dissent was crushed in the name of unity in time of war. The intense fear of a standing army as a threat to liberty and the corresponding heavy reliance on state militias to prosecute the war proved disastrous. Republican antitax ideology meant that Congress refused to raise internal taxes during the war. The failure in 1811 to renew the charter of the First Bank of the United States, as called for by Republican ideology, added to the difficulties and cost of financing the war and resulted in a bankrupt government beholden to the nation’s wealthy elite in order to regain solvency. The Jeffersonians attempted to pursue the foreign policy of a fiscal-military state while dismantling the fiscal-military apparatus put in place by the hated Federalists. Predictably, this approach failed, and in 1813–14 the nation found itself wedged between internal chaos and foreign conquest.","['1811', 'fiscal']",war reveal tension republican small government ideology reality jeffersonian foreign policy political dissent crush unity time war intense fear stand army threat liberty correspond heavy reliance state militia prosecute war prove disastrous republican antitax ideology mean congress refuse raise internal tax war failure 1811 renew charter bank united state call republican ideology add difficulty cost finance war result bankrupt government beholden nation ’s wealthy elite order regain solvency jeffersonian attempt pursue foreign policy fiscal military state dismantle fiscal military apparatus place hat federalist predictably approach fail 1813–14 nation find wedge internal chaos foreign conquest,94,[1811],1811,1,1825,1850
106,"This wrongheaded policy culminated in the close call of 1814. Napoleon’s initial defeat gave Britain the chance to concentrate its accumulated rage and resentment on its erstwhile colonists and compatriots, who had been a thorn in their imperial side at the very moment they had sought to quell the Napoleonic threat. Now temporarily at peace on the continent, the British planned a three-pronged assault for late summer on the United States in an attempt to divide if not destroy the Union. At the minimum, the offensive aimed to block further U.S. expansionism. At first it seemed this strategy might pay off. The invasion up the Chesapeake met with ineffective resistance, and news of the capture of Washington, D.C., and the burning of the White House on August 14 rocked the peace talks occurring in the city of Ghent. After news of the fall of the capital arrived in early September, American negotiators John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and James A. Bayard were presented with onerous peace terms that included territorial concessions allowing for British navigation of the Mississippi, a U.S. demilitarization of the Great Lakes, a quarter-million-square-mile Indian buffer zone between Canada and the United States, and recognition of the treaty rights of Britain’s Native American allies. At Clay’s behest, the Americans bluntly refused the British demands and threatened to break off the talks. This bold move prompted the British to moderate their terms to the uti possidetis, or state of possession, at the war’s end. This still would have left substantial portions of Maine as well as control of Fort Niagara in British hands.","['1814', 'late summer', 'August 14', 'early September']",wrongheaded policy culminate close 1814 napoleon ’s initial defeat give britain chance concentrate accumulate rage resentment erstwhile colonist compatriot thorn imperial moment seek quell napoleonic threat temporarily peace continent british plan pronged assault late summer united state attempt divide destroy union minimum offensive aim block u.s expansionism strategy pay invasion chesapeake meet ineffective resistance news capture washington d.c burning white house august 14 rock peace talk occur city ghent news fall capital arrive early september negotiator john quincy adams henry clay james a. bayard present onerous peace term include territorial concession allow british navigation mississippi u.s demilitarization great lake quarter million square mile indian buffer zone canada united state recognition treaty right britain ’s native ally clay ’s behest american bluntly refuse british demand threaten break talk bold prompt british moderate term uti possidetis state possession war ’s end leave substantial portion maine control fort niagara british hand,148,[1814],1814,1,1825,1850
107,"The burning of the White House and the capture of Washington, D.C., in August 1814 held more symbolic than strategic importance. It was done largely in retaliation for the sacking of York, the capital of Upper Canada, by American troops the previous year. Madison, like Jefferson when he was wartime governor of Virginia, suffered the ignominy of having to flee into the night to evade capture by the advancing British forces. Baltimore, a major port, the nation’s third-largest city, and a hotbed of Anglophobia, was of far greater importance to British plans. As British forces advanced by land and by sea on that city after the fall of Washington, no one could say where the enemy offensive might end. On September 14 a British naval task force arrived at the mouth of the Patapsco River beneath Fort McHenry, a modest earthen-walled fort dominated by an enormous 30-foot × 42-foot American flag flying above, the faithful handiwork of Mary Pickersgill, a local seamstress. During the night, the British frigates pounded the fort with approximately eighteen hundred bombs and rockets. When the sun rose and the smoke cleared, the flag, the fort, and the Maryland militia defending it, all were still standing, and the British invasion fleet, its firepower spent, retreated down Chesapeake Bay. Jefferson’s militia had come through after all, but as defenders, not conquerors. Although famous as the inspiration for Francis Scott Key’s “Star Spangled Banner,” the Battle of Baltimore is underrated in its strategic importance. Together with Lt. Thomas McDonough’s naval victory on Lake Champlain three days earlier, the victory in Baltimore stopped the British invasion in its tracks.

108,"Two weeks after the signing in London of the peace treaty ending the war on Christmas Eve, 1814, the decisive victory of Andrew Jackson’s unlikely assortment of Tennessee volunteers, state militia, Native Americans, and French Creoles over a British force attacking New Orleans put an exclamation point on the heroic defense of the homeland. Although its timing rendered the Battle of New Orleans irrelevant to the treaty ending the war, it nonetheless prompted euphoria among Americans. They had gone toe-to-toe with the mightiest power in the world and had emerged, if not wholly victorious, at least unvanquished. American sovereignty and independence had been established once and for all. The struggle confirmed to a new generation of Americans their role as worthy successors to their revolutionary forebears. The war seemed to some to have a purifying effect on the public mind, a regenerative struggle to counteract the perceived degeneration of a commercial society. No one emerged from it with more luster than Andrew Jackson of Tennessee. In many ways he seemed to epitomize the successors to the revolutionary generation: born on the frontier, experienced in war against both Native Americans and the British, heavily involved in speculation in western lands, personally ambitious, and faithful to a code of honor that judged violence as an appropriate response to even the smallest personal affront. In many respects, both good and bad, Jackson personified the emerging energies of post-1815 America. John Quincy Adams had unknowingly heralded the rise of Jackson and his ilk when he had characterized the war as an opportunity to recover “the great and glorious qualities in the human character which as they can unfold themselves only in time of difficulty and danger seem to make war from time to time a necessary evil among men…. God grant that in suffering the unavoidable calamities we may recover in all their vigor the energies of war!”4","['Two weeks', 'Christmas Eve', '1814']",week signing london peace treaty end war christmas eve 1814 decisive victory andrew jackson ’s unlikely assortment tennessee volunteer state militia native american french creole british force attack new orlean exclamation point heroic defense homeland timing render battle new orlean irrelevant treaty end war nonetheless prompt euphoria american go toe toe mighty power world emerge wholly victorious unvanquished sovereignty independence establish struggle confirm new generation american role worthy successor revolutionary forebear war purify effect public mind regenerative struggle counteract perceive degeneration commercial society emerge luster andrew jackson tennessee way epitomize successor revolutionary generation bear frontier experience war native american british heavily involve speculation western land personally ambitious faithful code honor judge violence appropriate response small personal affront respect good bad jackson personify emerge energy post-1815 america john quincy adams unknowingly herald rise jackson ilk characterize war opportunity recover “ great glorious quality human character unfold time difficulty danger war time time necessary evil man … god grant suffer unavoidable calamity recover vigor energy war!”4,164,[1814],1814,1,1825,1850
109,"As had been the case in the War of Independence, the Native American tribes who counted on British support to resist the American expansionist advance proved the real losers of the War of 1812. Beginning in 1811 at the Battle of the Thames, in which Tecumseh’s “spirited resistance” met its end with his death and his followers scattered, American forces sought bloody retribution against those tribes allegedly instigated by the British to harass American settlements. The Creek War of 1813–14 resulted in another gigantic land grab, but only after the death of thousands of Creeks from war, famine, and dislocation. Jackson’s decisive victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814 led to the imposition of the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which transferred 23 million acres to the United States, most of which had belonged to Creek factions allied with the Americans. Although Article Nine of the Treaty of Ghent pledged to restore to Indians any land lost in the conflict, in the aftermath of the conflict London showed no inclination to hold the Americans to that stipulation. The year 1815, then, marked the final defeat of the Indian resistance in the United States east of the Mississippi River, after nearly three-quarters of a century of war. What had been the primary obstacle to expansion had been defeated; those Indians who survived would soon be removed. In this regard, the War of 1812 stands as an important victory for the American Empire.","['1811', '1814', 'The year 1815']",case war independence native tribe count british support resist expansionist advance prove real loser war 1812 begin 1811 battle thames tecumseh ’s “ spirited resistance ” meet end death follower scatter force seek bloody retribution tribe allegedly instigate british harass settlement creek war 1813–14 result gigantic land grab death thousand creek war famine dislocation jackson ’s decisive victory battle horseshoe bend 1814 lead imposition treaty fort jackson transfer 23 million acre united state belong creek faction ally american article treaty ghent pledge restore indians land lose conflict aftermath conflict london show inclination hold american stipulation year 1815 mark final defeat indian resistance united state east mississippi river nearly quarter century war primary obstacle expansion defeat indian survive soon remove regard war 1812 stand important victory empire,126,"[1811, 1814, 1815]",1813,3,1825,1850
110,"The return of peace and the end of the high seas controversies caused by the Napoleonic Wars did much to change the national mood after 1815. In spite of the near-defeat, near-bankruptcy, and near–civil war caused by the recent conflict, an ebullient optimism emerged in its wake. A new burst of westward expansionism, rising economic prosperity, and the distinct cooling of ideological passions explain this new national consensus. The Federalist party, tainted by secession as a result of the Hartford Convention and treason owing to its members’ widespread sympathy and support for the British, almost disappeared after the war. Its principles, however, survived to a considerable degree in a reimagined Jeffersonian Republican party whose leaders now embraced a new national bank, a limited program of federally financed internal improvements, and a moderate protective tariff in the name of encouraging domestic manufactures and restoring national stability.

111,"Movement toward true reconciliation with Great Britain proved to be the most significant ideological shift by the Republicans. Their intense, almost Oedipal hostility to all things British ebbed, replaced by a desire for commerce and cooperation reminiscent of the Federalists in the 1790s. Having affirmed the autonomy of a new generation of Americans in a Second War of Independence, the Jeffersonian Republicans now looked to construct a relationship with Great Britain based on mutual interest and respect, although residual hostility to John Bull persisted for decades.","['the 1790s', 'decades']",movement true reconciliation great britain prove significant ideological shift republican intense oedipal hostility thing british ebb replace desire commerce cooperation reminiscent federalist 1790s have affirm autonomy new generation american second war independence jeffersonian republicans look construct relationship great britain base mutual interest respect residual hostility john bull persist decade,49,[1790],1790,1,1800,1800
112,"Although the United States emerged from the War of 1812 in far better shape than might have dared been hoped, the postwar world presented major challenges in foreign affairs. The war and the years running up to it effectively had shelved other preexisting issues that now had to be addressed, starting with the resolution of outstanding issues regarding trade and boundaries with Great Britain that the peace treaty ending the war had left unaddressed. European observers perceived that the two nations had achieved only a brief armistice and that renewed conflict was only a matter of time. Equally threatening, a long-standing dispute with Spain over ownership of East and West Florida and the specifics of the western boundary offered no easy solution. Spain had contested the legality of France’s sale of Louisiana from the start and now hoped to define its uncertain limits so narrowly as to effectively stop expansion to the southwest. The ancient fear of being encircled by European powers that so worried Franklin and others in the 1750s remained a serious concern in the first decades of the nineteenth century.","['years', 'the 1750s', 'the first decades of the nineteenth century']",united state emerge war 1812 far good shape dare hop postwar world present major challenge foreign affair war year run effectively shelve preexist issue address start resolution outstanding issue trade boundary great britain peace treaty end war leave unaddressed european observer perceive nation achieve brief armistice renew conflict matter time equally threatening long stand dispute spain ownership east west florida specific western boundary offer easy solution spain contest legality france ’s sale louisiana start hop define uncertain limit narrowly effectively stop expansion southwest ancient fear encircle european power worry franklin 1750s remain concern decade nineteenth century,96,[1750],1750,1,1775,1800
113,"The issue of formal sovereign control of the “borderlands” along the southern frontier was made immeasurably worse by the role those borderlands played as a refuge for Indians and blacks fleeing the wrath of the Americans. While West Florida, in effect, had been annexed by the Madison administration after being revolutionized by a pro-American faction in 1810, East Florida (that area east of the Apalachicola River) remained beyond U.S. control and ineffectively governed by Spain, creating a political refuge that allowed for Indians and runaway slaves (at times joining together in single communities) to resist capture. White Southerners along the Georgia-Florida border found this intolerable. The so-called Negro Fort on the lower Apalachicola River, on the site of an abandoned British garrison, symbolized a particularly ominous manifestation of the racial autonomy of the region. Several hundred runaway slaves and Indians occupied this site until in 1816 cannon fire from an American naval patrol sent to take down the fort destroyed it. The enormous blast from a direct hit on its gunpowder cache obliterated the Negro Fort, killing an estimated 250 of its inhabitants. Yet this spectacular event by no means pacified the Florida frontier. Remnants of the Creek tribes defeated by Jackson had fled across the border into the province, where they now joined with other Indian tribes and runaway slaves to become the Seminoles, not so much a distinct Indian tribe as an amalgam of races and cultures bound together by their common resistance to American expansionism. White Georgians deemed the existence of this black-Indian refuge as intolerable and demanded that the national government act to suppress it.","['1810', '1816']",issue formal sovereign control “ borderland ” southern frontier immeasurably bad role borderland play refuge indian black flee wrath american west florida effect annex madison administration revolutionize pro faction 1810 east florida area east apalachicola river remain u.s control ineffectively govern spain create political refuge allow indian runaway slave time join single community resist capture white southerner georgia florida border find intolerable call negro fort low apalachicola river site abandon british garrison symbolize particularly ominous manifestation racial autonomy region runaway slave indians occupy site 1816 cannon fire naval patrol send fort destroy enormous blast direct hit gunpowder cache obliterate negro fort kill estimate 250 inhabitant spectacular event means pacify florida frontier remnant creek tribe defeat jackson flee border province join indian tribe runaway slave seminole distinct indian tribe amalgam race culture bind common resistance expansionism white georgian deem existence black indian refuge intolerable demand national government act suppress,148,"[1810, 1816]",1813,2,1825,1850
114,"While the presence of European powers in North America threatened to block U.S. expansionism to the west and south, the rest of the hemisphere faced political uncertainty owing to the collapse of European colonialism in Spanish America. Specifically, the revolt against Spanish authority in the Americas that began in 1808 now included most of its colonies, although by 1817 none had achieved complete victory. It is fair to say that citizens of the United States overwhelmingly supported in principle the idea of South American independence, seeing it as a natural consequence of their example. In practice, the revolutions presented, from the U.S. perspective, a host of potential problems: Would the insurgents be capable of creating true republican liberty? Would a new, homegrown tyranny merely replace Spanish despotism? A far more troubling prospect was related to fears that the European powers would deploy an expeditionary force in an attempt to restore Spain’s New World Empire. That seemed a distinct possibility in the years after 1815.","['1808', 'the years after 1815']",presence european power north america threaten block u.s expansionism west south rest hemisphere face political uncertainty owe collapse european colonialism spanish america specifically revolt spanish authority america begin 1808 include colony 1817 achieve complete victory fair citizen united state overwhelmingly support principle idea south independence see natural consequence example practice revolution present u.s perspective host potential problem insurgent capable create true republican liberty new homegrown tyranny merely replace spanish despotism far troubling prospect relate fear european power deploy expeditionary force attempt restore spain ’s new world empire distinct possibility year 1815,91,"[1808, 1815]",1812,2,1825,1850
115,"Henry Clay of Kentucky led those pushing to give the United States a head start on access to the emerging markets of South America. As speaker of the House in 1817, Clay led the campaign attempting to force the Monroe administration to take the lead in recognizing the rebellious states. Clay combined passionate appeals on behalf of liberty with a hardheaded assessment of what the United States stood to gain by backing their cause, chiefly the role as its primary trade partner. He envisioned the states of the trans-Appalachian west as standing to benefit from a lucrative commercial connection to the South American republics via New Orleans, thereby freeing the west from its neocolonial economic dependence on the states of the Atlantic Seaboard. Politically, Clay sought to exploit Madison’s precedent of weak presidential leadership to affirm the right of the House to make foreign policy and to position himself for a future run for the presidency. Monroe, at Adams’s urging, staunchly resisted precipitous action, even mere diplomatic recognition, on behalf of the Latin American revolutions as both premature and as needlessly complicating the ongoing talks with Spain and Great Britain.

116,"The most pressing foreign policy difficulty faced by the incoming Monroe administration and its new secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, concerned the outstanding issues with Spain. The Spanish government initially claimed that Napoleon, under the terms of the retrocession to France in 1800, had no right to transfer Louisiana to the United States. This impractical and ultimately unenforceable position gave way in 1815 to grudging recognition of the legality of the sale and efforts to define the vague boundaries of Louisiana as narrowly as possible. On the U.S. side, the ambiguity of the boundary had been from the start seen as advantageous in that it created the conditions for an essentially open-ended claim on western North America. American assertions that Louisiana included West Florida, dubious at best, served as justification for its absorption in the aftermath of the West Florida Revolution of 1810. The Napoleonic Wars interrupted talks to resolve the matter; restoration of the Spanish royal family in the aftermath of the fall of Napoleon did not lead immediately to the resumption of negotiations, as Madrid judged that it had more to gain from a policy of delay. Finally, in late 1817 the two sides resumed direct talks, but the Spanish remained minimally inclined to compromise. Of all the major European powers, Spain had long been the most suspicious of the rising American Empire. Emblematic of this sentiment, in the aftermath of the War of Independence the Spanish minister to France had observed, “This federal republic is born a pygmy,” but “the day will come when it will be a giant, even a colossus.”5 Spain now hoped to erect a bulwark to prevent the United States from encroaching on the remaining Spanish colonies in the New World.","['1800', '1815']",press foreign policy difficulty face incoming monroe administration new secretary state john quincy adams concern outstanding issue spain spanish government initially claim napoleon term retrocession france 1800 right transfer louisiana united state impractical ultimately unenforceable position give way 1815 grudging recognition legality sale effort define vague boundary louisiana narrowly possible u.s ambiguity boundary start see advantageous create condition essentially open ended claim western north america assertion louisiana include west florida dubious best serve justification absorption aftermath west florida revolution 1810 napoleonic war interrupt talk resolve matter restoration spanish royal family aftermath fall napoleon lead immediately resumption negotiation madrid judge gain policy delay finally late 1817 side resume direct talk spanish remain minimally inclined compromise major european power spain long suspicious rise empire emblematic sentiment aftermath war independence spanish minister france observe “ federal republic bear pygmy ” “ day come giant colossus.”5 spain hop erect bulwark prevent united state encroach remain spanish colony new world,155,"[1800, 1815]",1808,2,1825,1850
117,"Control of the Floridas had been an American obsession for years. Its geography led some to see it as a pistol pointed at New Orleans, and more generally as an invasion route for attacking the entire southern United States. In 1806, Jefferson pushed though Congress the Two Million Act allocating monies (never utilized) to bribe Napoleon into pressuring Spain to cede the province to the United States. In 1811, after the failed Mathews mission to revolutionize East Florida had left Spanish sovereignty intact, Congress, citing the “security, tranquility, and commerce” of the United States, had resolved that the United States “cannot without serious inquietude see any part of the said territory pass into the hands of any foreign Power,” reserving the right to occupy the Floridas as necessary to prevent this from occurring. This resolution became the grounds for the annexation of that part of West Florida between the Perdido and Pearl Rivers in 1812. Yet East Florida remained in Spanish hands in 1815, and there seemed no easy way to alter that situation.","['years', '1806', '1811', '1812', '1815']",control florida obsession year geography lead pistol point new orlean generally invasion route attack entire southern united state 1806 jefferson push congress million act allocate monie utilize bribe napoleon pressure spain cede province united state 1811 fail mathews mission revolutionize east florida leave spanish sovereignty intact congress cite “ security tranquility commerce ” united state resolve united state “ inquietude say territory pass hand foreign power ” reserve right occupy floridas necessary prevent occur resolution ground annexation west florida perdido pearl river 1812 east florida remain spanish hand 1815 easy way alter situation,93,"[1806, 1811, 1812, 1815]",1811,4,1825,1850
118,"Minister to the United States Don Luis de Onis did most of the negotiating for Spain. Although not formally recognized as a diplomatic representative until 1815, Onis had informally represented Spanish interests in the United States since 1809. His lengthy time in the United States made him decidedly suspicious of the motives of Americans. He wrote in his Memoria, “The Americans believe themselves superior to all the nations of Europe, and see their destiny to extend their dominion to the Isthmus of Panama, and in the future to all of the New World.”6 As per instructions from the Consejo de Estado in Madrid, Onis staunchly resisted any significant compromise on the western boundary. The Spanish judged that the restorationist tide sweeping Europe and contemplating intervention in the Latin American revolutions could be counted on to back Madrid in standing up to the Americans. For years the Spanish had attempted to designate the Mississippi River as the westernmost boundary of Louisiana. This, of course, would have invalidated most of the Louisiana Purchase, containing U.S. expansionism in the process. In late 1817, Onis began talks with Adams by placing the western boundary at the Mermento River (located only a few miles west of the Mississippi) and extending northward to the Missouri River. This would have deprived the United States of virtually all of the lands west of the Mississippi and south of the Missouri Rivers. Onis adamantly refused to transfer either of the Floridas, repeating the long-held claim that they formed no part of Louisiana. Adams countered with a proposal transferring all Spanish-controlled territories east of the Mississippi to the United States and fixing a western boundary along the Rio Colorado of Texas to its source and thence northward to the Rocky Mountains. In early 1818, the United States seemed caught between the rocks of Spanish intransigence and European reaction.","['1815', '1809', 'years', 'late 1817', 'early 1818']",minister united state don luis de onis negotiating spain formally recognize diplomatic representative 1815 onis informally represent spanish interest united state 1809 lengthy time united state decidedly suspicious motif american write memoria “ american believe superior nation europe destiny extend dominion isthmus panama future new world.”6 instruction consejo de estado madrid onis staunchly resist significant compromise western boundary spanish judge restorationist tide sweep europe contemplate intervention latin revolution count madrid stand american year spanish attempt designate mississippi river westernmost boundary louisiana course invalidate louisiana purchase contain u.s expansionism process late 1817 onis begin talk adam place western boundary mermento river locate mile west mississippi extend northward missouri river deprive united state virtually land west mississippi south missouri river onis adamantly refuse transfer floridas repeat long hold claim form louisiana adam counter proposal transfer spanish control territory east mississippi united state fix western boundary rio colorado texas source northward rocky mountain early 1818 united state catch rock spanish intransigence european reaction,160,"[1815, 1809, 1817, 1818]",1815,4,1825,1850
119,"A brewing confrontation over the institution of slavery and its spread complicated the challenges the United States confronted internationally in the post-1815 world. Having failed to die a natural death as people north and south had hoped for in the 1790s, slavery now made a dynamic comeback thanks to the suddenly burgeoning demand for cotton. The resumption of peace in 1815 set off a land rush westward, especially to the rich lands opened up in Georgia and Alabama by the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which promised to be enormously profitable for cotton and the slave labor essential to its production. Yet a small but passionate opposition to the further spread of slavery came to life politically, building on the opposition to human bondage evident at the Constitutional Convention. The final incorporation of the immense Louisiana territory into the Union presented a number of challenges, none more serious than how to handle the explosive issue of slavery.

120,"Monroe, in the tradition of Washington, sought to strengthen the Unionist consensus that he saw as crucial to national survival. It is not surprising that the phrase “Era of Good Feelings” first appeared in a Boston newspaper as Monroe conducted a grand tour of the northern and western states in 1817 in an attempt to banish the memory of the divisiveness of the recent war with Britain and cultivate loyalty to the national government. The first president to make a national tour since Washington, Monroe encountered large and enthusiastic crowds at every stop, people who welcomed his eighteenth-century manner of dress as a visible symbol of his ties to the revolutionary era. Throughout his administration, Monroe sought to balance the diversity of interests and outlooks that comprised the Union. He projected an air of unity, consensus, and calm amid some of the sharpest divisions yet to arise in American history.","['1817', 'eighteenth-century']",monroe tradition washington seek strengthen unionist consensus see crucial national survival surprising phrase “ era good feeling appear boston newspaper monroe conduct grand tour northern western state 1817 attempt banish memory divisiveness recent war britain cultivate loyalty national government president national tour washington monroe encounter large enthusiastic crowd stop people welcome eighteenth century manner dress visible symbol tie revolutionary era administration monroe seek balance diversity interest outlook comprise union project air unity consensus calm amid sharp division arise history,79,[1817],1817,1,1825,1850
121,"Politically and philosophically, Monroe proved less doctrinaire than either Jefferson or Madison. Monroe did not have the intense loathing of England characteristic of the two earlier presidents, preferring to adhere to Washington’s maxim of avoiding both passionate attachments and passionate hatreds in international affairs. His fundamentally pragmatic approach to politics led to his eager embrace of the turn toward a neo-Federalist policy of centralization at home and rapprochement with Great Britain abroad. Although in conflict with Republican ideology, these policies seemed most likely to enhance the prosperity and security of the Union. Consistent with these goals, Monroe favored federally supported internal improvements and the resurrection of the Bank of the United States, whose charter the Republican Congress had allowed to expire in 1811. He backed a dramatic expansion in the number of post offices, doubling the miles of post roads in the name of knitting the Union together more tightly. He also advocated a significant expansion of the navy and upgrades of coastal defenses in order to make the United States respected abroad and protected at home.

122,"One of Monroe’s primary goals as president was aimed at encouraging and expanding American foreign trade via the negotiation of commercial reciprocity treaties. Surplus production of raw materials and agricultural produce threatened to glut the national economy unless foreign markets could be found on good terms. A policy of reciprocity promised to level the tariff playing field with other states while the United States retained a comparative advantage in shipping costs. At the same time, Congress in 1816 enacted tariff protection for American manufactures in the name of strengthening the Union. The net result was a uniquely American form of neo-mercantilism designed to gain access to foreign markets while protecting key sectors of the economy from destructive competition. This was yet another startling departure from Republican orthodoxy.",['1816'],monroe ’s primary goal president aim encourage expand foreign trade negotiation commercial reciprocity treaty surplus production raw material agricultural produce threaten glut national economy foreign market find good term policy reciprocity promise level tariff playing field state united state retain comparative advantage shipping cost time congress 1816 enact tariff protection manufacture strengthen union net result uniquely form neo mercantilism design gain access foreign market protect key sector economy destructive competition startling departure republican orthodoxy,74,[1816],1816,1,1825,1850
123,"The recovery of the economy and the success of the Monroe administration both hinged on improving relations with Great Britain. The postwar consensus on the advisability of a rapprochement with Great Britain combined with the fact that the two nations were each other’s largest trading partner speeded the reconciliation. Negotiation of a commercial treaty in 1815 had been the first sign of this reconciliation, followed by the signing of the Rush-Bagot Treaty reducing naval forces on the Great Lakes in April 1817. Britain’s postwar financial distresses and movement toward liberalizing its mercantile restrictions also contributed to reconciliation of the former foes. But the international community was slow to notice this change in Anglo-American relations. Indeed, the vitriolic tone that continued to characterize much press opinion on both sides of the Atlantic contributed to a sense that another war might break out at the slightest provocation.","['1815', 'April 1817']",recovery economy success monroe administration hinge improve relation great britain postwar consensus advisability rapprochement great britain combine fact nation ’s large trading partner speed reconciliation negotiation commercial treaty 1815 sign reconciliation follow signing rush bagot treaty reduce naval force great lake april 1817 britain ’s postwar financial distress movement liberalize mercantile restriction contribute reconciliation foe international community slow notice change anglo relation vitriolic tone continue characterize press opinion side atlantic contribute sense war break slight provocation,76,"[1815, 1817]",1816,2,1825,1850
124,"In order to end Spanish intransigence at the negotiating table, Monroe, at Adams’s urging, began to apply military pressure on Spanish possessions. It was a risky policy that if improperly done might blow up in the face of the administration. The first application of force occurred at Amelia Island, on the Georgia–East Florida border. There a ragtag band of Latin American revolutionaries, mercenaries, and smugglers had occupied the island undisturbed by Spanish royal authority, which lacked the resources to recapture it. In early December 1817 and without congressional approval, the administration ordered a small force of sailors and marines to evict the supposed freedom fighters, taking possession of the site in the name of suppressing smuggling and increasing security along the southern border. Minister Onis protested this action as an outrageous violation of Spanish sovereignty (as did some of the administration’s political opponents), but Adams deemed it justified by Spain’s manifest failure to exert effective control over what the administration deemed to be a lawless region.",['early December 1817'],order end spanish intransigence negotiating table monroe adams ’s urging begin apply military pressure spanish possession risky policy improperly blow face administration application force occur amelia island georgia – east florida border ragtag band latin revolutionary mercenary smuggler occupy island undisturbed spanish royal authority lack resource recapture early december 1817 congressional approval administration order small force sailor marine evict suppose freedom fighter take possession site suppress smuggling increase security southern border minister onis protest action outrageous violation spanish sovereignty administration ’s political opponent adam deem justify spain ’s manifest failure exert effective control administration deem lawless region,97,[1817],1817,1,1825,1850
125,"A far more serious challenge to Spain’s authority in East Florida occurred in late December 1817. Accelerated efforts to remove the scattered bands of Native Americans remaining in southern Georgia had led to rising tensions in the border region. Frontiersmen, mercenaries, and speculators agitated continually to drive out the last remaining Indians by any means available. In early November 1817, American forces commanded by General Edmund P. Gaines had attacked the village of Fowltown, just north of the border, where a band of Creek Indians resided who were allied with the United States during the war and who were not subject to removal according to the Treaty of Fort Jackson. Nonetheless, Gaines and his troops killed several members of the tribe, ran off the rest, and burned Fowltown to the ground. This provocation prompted a grisly retaliation. In late November, a Creek war party attacked an American naval supply vessel ascending the Apalachicola River in Spanish territory just south of the Georgia border, killing forty of its passengers. Georgians howled at this outrage, and Monroe and Secretary of War Calhoun responded decisively, dispatching orders to General Andrew Jackson in Tennessee to gather a force, proceed to East Florida, and “chastise” the perpetrators of the deed. Although authorized to cross into East Florida in pursuit of the enemy, Jackson was not explicitly directed in the official orders to conquer the province. That would be an act of war prosecuted without congressional authorization and potentially would involve the United States in a direct confrontation with Spain and its European allies, especially Great Britain. The full extent of Jackson’s orders will never be known for sure; he later claimed that he had been given expanded authority from the administration to conquer East Florida via an unofficial (and therefore deniable) channel. Yet it must be asked, Why would Monroe and Calhoun summon Jackson, famous for his boldness, from Tennessee for this mission with the competent Gaines readily available?","['late December 1817', 'early November 1817', 'late November']",far challenge spain ’s authority east florida occur late december 1817 accelerate effort remove scatter band native american remain southern georgia lead rise tension border region frontiersman mercenary speculator agitate continually drive remain indian mean available early november 1817 force command general edmund p. gaine attack village fowltown north border band creek indian reside ally united state war subject removal accord treaty fort jackson nonetheless gaines troop kill member tribe run rest burn fowltown ground provocation prompt grisly retaliation late november creek war party attack naval supply vessel ascend apalachicola river spanish territory south georgia border kill passenger georgian howl outrage monroe secretary war calhoun respond decisively dispatch order general andrew jackson tennessee gather force proceed east florida “ chastise ” perpetrator deed authorize cross east florida pursuit enemy jackson explicitly direct official order conquer province act war prosecute congressional authorization potentially involve united state direct confrontation spain european ally especially great britain extent jackson ’s order know sure later claim give expand authority administration conquer east florida unofficial deniable channel ask monroe calhoun summon jackson famous boldness tennessee mission competent gaine readily available,184,"[1817, 1817]",1817,2,1825,1850

127,"The unyielding defense of what seemed at first glance to be indefensible caught the Spanish off-balance. Initially, Onis had expected the events in Florida to strengthen his hand in resisting Adams’s demands. The governments of Europe expressed outrage at the situation as a violation of accepted international practices. The Spanish government assumed that Jackson’s brutal treatment of two British subjects would ensure London’s support. Nevertheless, while the British public clamored for revenge, the British government understood it had no motive to disrupt the ongoing rapprochement with the Americans in order to vindicate the lost honor either of its two dead subjects or of Spain. The other European powers acquiesced in Britain’s restrained response, lacking the means effectively to project armed force so far from their shores. Onis soon realized that the capture of Amelia Island and the invasion of Florida foreshadowed an uncompensated seizure of the province. With the approval of the government in Madrid, he moved to make the concessions necessary to conclude a treaty while he still could. At this critical point, the administration made a bold move. Adams’s new offer of July 1818 contained a surprising new twist: Instead of a western boundary extending from the headwaters of the Rio Colorado and thence north to the Rockies, the Americans now proposed to draw the line at the Sabine River, thus excluding Texas. In exchange for this major concession, Adams now asked for a transcontinental boundary with a northern limit running roughly along the forty-second parallel to the Pacific. The acquisition of the Floridas assured, the Monroe administration unexpectedly introduced an entirely new dimension into the talks with Spain: a boundary extending to the West Coast.","['July 1818', 'now']",unyielding defense glance indefensible catch spanish balance initially onis expect event florida strengthen hand resist adams ’s demand government europe express outrage situation violation accept international practice spanish government assume jackson ’s brutal treatment british subject ensure london ’s support british public clamor revenge british government understand motive disrupt ongoing rapprochement american order vindicate lost honor dead subject spain european power acquiesce britain ’s restrained response lack mean effectively project armed force far shore onis soon realize capture amelia island invasion florida foreshadow uncompensated seizure province approval government madrid move concession necessary conclude treaty critical point administration bold adams ’s new offer july 1818 contain surprising new twist instead western boundary extend headwater rio colorado north rockie american propose draw line sabine river exclude texas exchange major concession adam ask transcontinental boundary northern limit run roughly second parallel pacific acquisition floridas assure monroe administration unexpectedly introduce entirely new dimension talk spain boundary extend west coast,155,[1818],1818,1,1825,1850
128,"The bid for a claim to the Pacific Coast did not originate with Monroe and Adams; Jefferson and Madison had first envisioned a transcontinental republic some years earlier.8 However distant and abstract a presence on the Pacific Coast may have seemed to most Americans at the time, government policy, prompted by the urgings of prominent citizens such as John Jacob Astor, aggressively moved to establish an American foothold on the Northwest Coast. In July 1818, the USS Ontario, commanded by Commodore James Biddle, had arrived at Astoria with orders to reassert U.S. sovereignty over the region, as per the terms of the Treaty of Ghent. Astor, one of the richest men in the country at the time and a creditor to President Monroe, had personally lobbied for the recovery of the spot where he had hoped to establish a fur trading empire before being forced to transfer Astoria to the British-owned Northwest Fur Company. Biddle’s largely symbolic act of repossession prepared the ground for a more formal assertion of a claim to the Northwest Coast via talks with Spain and Great Britain.","['some years', 'July 1818']",bid claim pacific coast originate monroe adams jefferson madison envision transcontinental republic year earlier.8 distant abstract presence pacific coast american time government policy prompt urging prominent citizen john jacob astor aggressively move establish foothold northwest coast july 1818 uss ontario command commodore jame biddle arrive astoria order reassert u.s sovereignty region term treaty ghent astor rich man country time creditor president monroe personally lobby recovery spot hop establish fur trading empire force transfer astoria british own northwest fur company biddle ’s largely symbolic act repossession prepare ground formal assertion claim northwest coast talk spain great britain,96,[1818],1818,1,1825,1850
129,"As all of this went on during the summer of 1818, the Monroe administration worked to further solidify relations with Great Britain. In July, Richard Rush and Albert Gallatin began talks with British officials in London designed to reach agreements on several outstanding issues between the two states: the status of the fisheries off the coast of Newfoundland; the demarcation of a northern boundary from the Lake of the Woods to the Rockies; control of the Oregon country along the Northwest Coast; compensation for slaves liberated by British forces during the War of 1812; and the end of the practice of impressment. The resulting Convention of 1818 resolved the first four of these issues, removing most of the remaining obstacles to amicable relations and smoothing the way to a massive expansion of Anglo-American trade. Thus it is not surprising that Jackson’s execution of Ambrister and Arbuthnot did not seriously threaten bilateral ties, though it did provoke heated denunciations of the Americans by members of Parliament and the press.","['the summer of 1818', 'July', '1818']",go summer 1818 monroe administration work solidify relation great britain july richard rush albert gallatin begin talk british official london design reach agreement outstanding issue state status fishery coast newfoundland demarcation northern boundary lake wood rockie control oregon country northwest coast compensation slave liberate british force war 1812 end practice impressment result convention 1818 resolve issue remove remain obstacle amicable relation smooth way massive expansion anglo trade surprising jackson ’s execution ambrister arbuthnot seriously threaten bilateral tie provoke heated denunciation american member parliament press,84,"[1818, 1818]",1818,2,1825,1850
130,"A policy of steadily increasing military pressure combined with the progressive separation of Spain from British support led to an agreement in February 1819. The Adams-Onis Treaty ceded the Floridas to the United States in exchange for assumption of claims by U.S. citizens against Spain totaling approximately $5 million. The western boundary began at the Sabine River on the Gulf Coast, from the source of that river northward to the Red River, along its course to the hundredth meridian, thence due north to the Arkansas River to its source, extending due north to the forty-second parallel, and from there to the Pacific Ocean. Popular enthusiasm for this spectacular diplomatic victory meant that almost no one at the time took notice of the concession of Texas. Why did Adams, at Monroe’s direction, prove willing to concede the claim to Texas? It cannot be blamed on Onis’s resistance, for his instructions gave him the authority to draw the western boundary along the Rio Colorado if necessary. Rather, this momentous decision resulted from Monroe’s concerns regarding the dangers of acquiring new territories amenable to slavery. The president foresaw the looming battle over slavery in the Missouri statehood debate and sought to avoid, as a threat to the Union, future such controversies. Monroe explained his thinking in letters to Jefferson and Jackson in May 1820. To Jefferson, Monroe expressed his concerns over the passions raised by the slavery issue: “[I]t is evident, that the further acquisition of territory, to the West and South, involves difficulties of an internal nature which menace the Union itself.” He advised that no more territories to the west or south be acquired without the consent of “at least a majority of those who accomplished our Revolution.” To Jackson, Monroe again expressed his concerns over “the repugnance with which the eastern portion of our Union” had viewed expansion to the west and south. He recommended that “we ought to be content with Florida for the present, and until the public opinion in that quarter shall be reconciled to any future change.”9 Monroe and Adams had committed a first-rate diplomatic sleight of hand, conceding an expansionist claim not owing to foreign opposition but because of internal political strife, and successfully disguising that fact to the public, at least for a while.","['February 1819', 'May 1820', 'that quarter']",policy steadily increase military pressure combine progressive separation spain british support lead agreement february 1819 adams onis treaty cede floridas united state exchange assumption claim u.s citizen spain total approximately 5 million western boundary begin sabine river gulf coast source river northward red river course hundredth meridian north arkansas river source extend north second parallel pacific ocean popular enthusiasm spectacular diplomatic victory mean time take notice concession texas adam monroe ’s direction prove willing concede claim texas blame onis ’s resistance instruction give authority draw western boundary rio colorado necessary momentous decision result monroe ’s concern danger acquire new territory amenable slavery president foresee loom battle slavery missouri statehood debate seek avoid threat union future controversy monroe explain thinking letter jefferson jackson 1820 jefferson monroe express concern passion raise slavery issue “ i]t evident acquisition territory west south involve difficulty internal nature menace union ” advise territory west south acquire consent “ majority accomplish revolution ” jackson monroe express concern repugnance eastern portion union ” view expansion west south recommend “ ought content florida present public opinion quarter shall reconcile future change.”9 monroe adams commit rate diplomatic sleight hand concede expansionist claim owe foreign opposition internal political strife successfully disguise fact public,202,"[1819, 1820]",1820,2,1825,1850
131,"Although the political brouhaha resulting in the Missouri Compromise has long been understood to be an important chapter in the history of the domestic conflict over slavery, its aspect as a foreign policy controversy has been underappreciated. The admission of Maine as a free state to balance Missouri’s admission as a slave state reflected an internal political compromise, the demarcation of the 36-degree, 30-minute line as the dividing line between future slave territory and free territory. This arrangement demonstrates the extent to which the expansionist consensus (and thus the Unionist consensus) had already collapsed, with ominous implications for the future. From at least the time of the Constitutional Convention, differences over slavery had been growing, not lessening, although both sides tacitly agreed to refrain from speaking of these differences. Thus, when Representative James Tallmadge of New York, motivated apparently by nothing more than an intense repugnance for human bondage, arose on February 13, 1819, to introduce an amendment to the Missouri statehood bill effectively abolishing slavery in the new state, it set off a vitriolic debate that threatened immediately to end the Union. The congressional speeches in the weeks to follow as recorded in the Annals of Congress proved to be a rehearsal of almost every argument over slavery to appear for the next forty years. Did the national government have the power to regulate slavery in the territories? Did the Declaration of Independence inevitably point in the direction of black freedom? Was slavery an oppressive institution, or was it mostly benign and ameliorative of the presumed civilizational shortcomings of blacks? Tallmadge’s defense of his amendment captures this intensity: “If dissolution of the Union must take place, let it be so! If civil war, which gentlemen so much threaten, must come, I can only say, let it come!”10","['February 13, 1819', 'the weeks', 'the next forty years']",political brouhaha result missouri compromise long understand important chapter history domestic conflict slavery aspect foreign policy controversy underappreciated admission maine free state balance missouri ’s admission slave state reflect internal political compromise demarcation 36-degree 30-minute line divide line future slave territory free territory arrangement demonstrate extent expansionist consensus unionist consensus collapse ominous implication future time constitutional convention difference slavery grow lessen side tacitly agree refrain speak difference representative james tallmadge new york motivate apparently intense repugnance human bondage arise february 13 1819 introduce amendment missouri statehood bill effectively abolish slavery new state set vitriolic debate threaten immediately end union congressional speech week follow record annal congress prove rehearsal argument slavery appear year national government power regulate slavery territory declaration independence inevitably point direction black freedom slavery oppressive institution benign ameliorative presume civilizational shortcoming black tallmadge ’s defense amendment capture intensity “ dissolution union place let civil war gentleman threaten come let come!”10,152,[1819],1819,1,1825,1850
132,"The future of the republican empire hung in the balance as congressional leaders and the Monroe administration looked for a compromise that could leave both sides feeling victorious and, more importantly, still firmly committed to the Union. Monroe opposed slavery for both practical and ideological reasons. He recognized it to be an outrageous contradiction of the Declaration of Independence and of America’s pretensions as the world’s preeminent champion of freedom. He also knew that its continued existence left the South in a perpetual state of anxiety regarding the prospect of slave uprisings: As governor of Virginia, Monroe himself had been targeted for kidnapping as part of Gabriel Prosser’s Virginia Slave Rebellion of 1800, a plot foiled only by a chance torrential downpour that disrupted the conspirators’ plans.",['1800'],future republican empire hang balance congressional leader monroe administration look compromise leave side feel victorious importantly firmly committed union monroe oppose slavery practical ideological reason recognize outrageous contradiction declaration independence america ’s pretension world ’s preeminent champion freedom know continue existence leave south perpetual state anxiety prospect slave uprising governor virginia monroe target kidnapping gabriel prosser ’s virginia slave rebellion 1800 plot foil chance torrential downpour disrupt conspirators’ plan,69,[1800],1800,1,1825,1850
133,"Typical of his hidden hand presidential style, Monroe’s behind-the-scenes role in brokering the series of compromises that made up the Missouri Compromise has only recently been discerned, a result of his efforts to disguise his role in persuading the various factions to go along with them. Monroe attempted to maintain a Unionist consensus in the face of potentially irreconcilable political differences by meeting the needs as he saw it of all sections. In this case, Monroe hoped that the acquisition of Florida would mollify Southern concerns for their security as well as offer the promise of more slave-state representation in Congress. At the same time, Monroe began to implement the policy of removing the defeated Indian tribes of the Southeast from their ancestral homelands to the western territories, thereby opening huge new tracts to cotton cultivation. He also vigorously supported the colonization of freed blacks in some new colony in Africa in the hopes of diffusing future problems related to their increasing numbers in many southern states. Yet to assuage the concerns of Northerners about the growth of the institution of slavery, he conceded the claim to Texas and in 1822 negotiated an agreement with Great Britain for the suppression of the African slave trade. Suffering no illusions about the severity of the slave question, Monroe took comprehensive and reasonably effective steps to ease it even as he continued to push an expansionist agenda. Robert Pierce Forbes concludes that Monroe aimed “to secure a compromise that would permit the expansion of slavery in principle, while prohibiting it in practice from the rest of the Louisiana Territory excepting Arkansas…. Monroe quietly built a majority for compromise while simultaneously assuring skittish slaveholders that he would give no quarter. He then secured their acquiescence in precisely the result he had promised to prevent by convincing them that his capitulation had saved the nation from a Federalist-abolitionist takeover.”12","['1822', 'no quarter']",typical hidden hand presidential style monroe ’s scene role broker series compromise missouri compromise recently discern result effort disguise role persuade faction monroe attempt maintain unionist consensus face potentially irreconcilable political difference meet need see section case monroe hop acquisition florida mollify southern concern security offer promise slave state representation congress time monroe begin implement policy remove defeat indian tribe southeast ancestral homeland western territory open huge new tract cotton cultivation vigorously support colonization free black new colony africa hope diffuse future problem relate increase number southern state assuage concern northerner growth institution slavery concede claim texas 1822 negotiate agreement great britain suppression african slave trade suffer illusion severity slave question monroe take comprehensive reasonably effective step ease continue push expansionist agenda robert pierce forbe conclude monroe aim “ secure compromise permit expansion slavery principle prohibit practice rest louisiana territory except arkansa … monroe quietly build majority compromise simultaneously assure skittish slaveholder quarter secure acquiescence precisely result promise prevent convince capitulation save nation federalist abolitionist takeover.”12,166,[1822],1822,1,1825,1850
134,"In the aftermath of the Missouri Debates, all sides came to a tacit agreement not to speak again of the potentially volcanic topic of slavery. However, it proved an enormously polarizing event, crystallizing a critique of slavery even as it galvanized support for it by white Southerners. Those, such as John Quincy Adams, who fashioned themselves as staunch nationalists found their consciences pricked by the debate. As it unfolded he wrote in his diary that the debate was “a mere preamble – a title page to a great tragic volume.” He went on to predict that “[i]f slavery be the destined sword in the hand of a destroying angel which is to sever the ties of this Union, the same sword will cut in sunder the bonds of slavery itself. A dissolution of the Union for the cause of slavery would be followed by a servile war in the slave-holding states, combined with a war between the two severed portions of the Union. It seems to me that its result must be the extirpation of slavery from this whole continent; and calamitous and desolating as this … must be, so glorious would be its final issue, that as God shall judge me, I dare not say that it is not to be desired.”13Southerners responded equally strongly to the Missouri controversy, accusing Rufus King’s incendiary Senate denunciation of slavery of being contrary to the laws of God and of instigating the foiled Denmark Vesey South Carolina slave uprising of 1820. One Virginian protested that antislavery rhetoric “would sound the tocsin of freedom to every Negro of the South and we may have to see the tragical events of Santo Domingo repeated in our own land.”14 If, as some scholars claim, the origin of the South as a distinct region dates from the Missouri controversy, this was in no small measure the result of a rapidly increasing threat of servile rebellion that united Southern whites in a republic of fear.",['1820'],aftermath missouri debate side come tacit agreement speak potentially volcanic topic slavery prove enormously polarizing event crystallize critique slavery galvanize support white southerner john quincy adams fashion staunch nationalist find conscience prick debate unfold write diary debate “ mere preamble – title page great tragic volume ” go predict “ i]f slavery destine sword hand destroy angel sever tie union sword cut sunder bond slavery dissolution union because slavery follow servile war slave hold state combine war sever portion union result extirpation slavery continent calamitous desolating … glorious final issue god shall judge dare desired.”13southerner respond equally strongly missouri controversy accuse rufus king ’s incendiary senate denunciation slavery contrary law god instigate foiled denmark vesey south carolina slave uprising 1820 virginian protest antislavery rhetoric “ sound tocsin freedom negro south tragical event santo domingo repeat land.”14 scholar claim origin south distinct region date missouri controversy small measure result rapidly increase threat servile rebellion unite southern white republic fear,158,[1820],1820,1,1825,1850

His first term had seen major achievements in foreign affairs, including important agreements with Great Britain and Spain, and the position of the United States was far less precarious than it had been in 1817.

136,"In September 1821, the tsar had issued a ukase asserting Russian control of the Northwest Coast as far south as 51 degrees and prohibiting Americans from its offshore waters in an area extending for one hundred nautical miles. Adams and Monroe immediately made plans to respond to this provocative attempt to expand Russian influence in the hemisphere. In 1822, the administration began to recognize the independence of the South American states even as the Holy Allies schemed to preserve monarchy in the New World by considering transferring some of the rebellious colonies to France. This, combined with the Holy Alliance’s interventions in the Italian and Iberian peninsulas, provoked British anxieties by threatening to tilt the balance of power in Europe as well as the New World. Anglo-American relations, steadily improving since 1815, now stood nearly perfectly aligned in opposition to the Holy Alliance’s schemes for a New World intervention.","['September 1821', '1822', '1815']",september 1821 tsar issue ukase assert russian control northwest coast far south 51 degree prohibit american offshore water area extend nautical mile adam monroe immediately plan respond provocative attempt expand russian influence hemisphere 1822 administration begin recognize independence south state holy ally scheme preserve monarchy new world consider transfer rebellious colony france combine holy alliance ’s intervention italian iberian peninsula provoke british anxiety threaten tilt balance power europe new world anglo relation steadily improve 1815 stand nearly perfectly align opposition holy alliance ’s scheme new world intervention,87,"[1821, 1822, 1815]",1819,3,1825,1850
137,"This set the stage for a series of conversations in August and September 1823 between British foreign secretary George Canning and American minister Richard Rush. Ultimately, Canning proposed to the Americans that the two nations make a joint declaration acknowledging the inevitable independence of the South American colonies from Spanish control, renouncing any intention to possess any portion of them, and opposing their transfer to any other European power. In effect, it was an offer of a de facto alliance with the world’s largest power to guarantee the independence and autonomy of the new South American republics. It seemed an excellent opportunity to commit British seapower on the side of nonintervention; initially, Monroe responded favorably to the proposal, as did both Jefferson and Madison, whom he consulted on the matter. To Jefferson, the prospect of aligning the Royal navy with U.S. interests outweighed the requirement that the annexation of Cuba be postponed indefinitely. Madison was enthusiastic, suggesting that the United States join with Britain in making statements opposing the interventions of the Holy Alliance in Europe and supporting the Greek independence movement. Calhoun, too, supported the idea of an Anglo-American front to oppose foreign intervention in the hemisphere.","['August', 'September 1823']",set stage series conversation august september 1823 british foreign secretary george canning minister richard rush ultimately can propose american nation joint declaration acknowledge inevitable independence south colony spanish control renounce intention possess portion oppose transfer european power effect offer de facto alliance world ’s large power guarantee independence autonomy new south republic excellent opportunity commit british seapower nonintervention initially monroe respond favorably proposal jefferson madison consult matter jefferson prospect align royal navy u.s interest outweigh requirement annexation cuba postpone indefinitely madison enthusiastic suggest united state join britain make statement oppose intervention holy alliance europe support greek independence movement calhoun support idea anglo oppose foreign intervention hemisphere,106,[1823],1823,1,1825,1850
138,"Once again Adams stood apart from the other members of the cabinet and opposed the seemingly irresistible offer of an Anglo-American alliance. As secretary of state, he clearly understood that the whole course of British policy since 1815 had shifted from supporting the restoration of monarchy to advocating open markets and liberal capitalism. In the Western Hemisphere, this meant opposing the restorationist schemes of the Holy Alliance and cultivating an independent Spanish America open to British commerce. London could be relied upon to oppose European intervention without any formal agreement with the United States, and therefore what possible advantage could there be in the United States renouncing future claims to former Spanish colonies, most notably Cuba? Always wary of agreeing to self-denying ordinances that might hinder future American expansionist plans, Adams now feared that the British were more eager to contain the expansionist tendencies of the United States than to prevent the intervention of the Holy Alliance. Adams, perhaps owing to the perspective offered from his many years abroad, understood that without British support the chances for a successful European invasion of the hemisphere were nil. Napoleon’s disastrous campaign to reconquer Sainte Domingue had proven that the New World could be a graveyard for Old World armies. Adams did not count on British power to stop an invasion. Rather, he counted on the inability of the Holy Allies to mount an invasion without it. The Holy Alliance, lacking the capacity effectively to project power across the Atlantic Ocean and throughout the extensive landmass of the Americas, by itself posed no threat to the hemisphere: “They will no more restore Spanish dominion on the American continent than the Chimborazo will sink beneath the ocean,” he said, referring to the famous Ecuadoran volcano.15 Confident that he had discerned Britain’s true aim of containing U.S. expansionism, Adams opposed calls for an alliance and instead pushed for an independent statement of American hemispheric policy. This included the firm admonition to resist making any statement about the Greek independence movement as an unnecessary interference in European affairs. Rather than position the United States as subordinate to British policy, Adams urged that the administration make hemispheric policy “an American cause” unrelated to European concerns. In essence, Adams urged a reprise of the strategy from the War of Independence, in which American diplomats assiduously cultivated European support and then abruptly changed course once that support was assured.","['1815', 'years']",adam stand apart member cabinet oppose seemingly irresistible offer anglo alliance secretary state clearly understand course british policy 1815 shift support restoration monarchy advocate open market liberal capitalism western hemisphere mean oppose restorationist scheme holy alliance cultivate independent spanish america open british commerce london rely oppose european intervention formal agreement united state possible advantage united state renounce future claim spanish colony notably cuba wary agree self deny ordinance hinder future expansionist plan adam fear british eager contain expansionist tendency united state prevent intervention holy alliance adam owe perspective offer year abroad understand british support chance successful european invasion hemisphere nil napoleon ’s disastrous campaign reconquer sainte domingue prove new world graveyard old world army adam count british power stop invasion count inability holy ally mount invasion holy alliance lack capacity effectively project power atlantic ocean extensive landmass america pose threat hemisphere “ restore spanish dominion continent chimborazo sink beneath ocean ” say refer famous ecuadoran volcano.15 confident discern britain ’s true aim contain u.s expansionism adam oppose call alliance instead push independent statement hemispheric policy include firm admonition resist make statement greek independence movement unnecessary interference european affair position united state subordinate british policy adam urge administration hemispheric policy “ because ” unrelated european concern essence adams urge reprise strategy war independence diplomat assiduously cultivate european support abruptly change course support assure,222,[1815],1815,1,1825,1850
139,"Monroe gave public voice to his emerging hemispheric foreign policy in his seventh annual message on December 2, 1823. In it, he detailed two distinct principles that would be the foundation of U.S. hemispheric policy to the present day. The first of these two principles, noncolonization, arose in response to the ongoing efforts of the tsar to assert his claims to the Northwest Coast. Alluding to the negotiations with Russia over the tsar’s ukase, Monroe set it down as a matter of unyielding principle that “the American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers.” It was a bold statement given the inability of the United States to enforce unilaterally the concept and the still-uncertain outcome of the South American independence struggles. Yet the whole course of American foreign policy since independence pointed in this direction, and circumstances now dictated that a stand be taken affirming it. More immediately, the implicit support of the British navy for this principle rested on its own changing economic interests and philosophies. Adams, especially, perceived this change and understood that it could be relied upon with far more certainty to control British policy in the future than any bilateral agreement. Hence, the United States could take its stand with confidence. Later in the address, Monroe articulated a second foundational pillar of American foreign relations: the principle of nonintervention. Acknowledging the sympathies many Americans felt for the Greek independence movement, Monroe emphasized that the United States would take no part in the struggle: “[I]n the wars of the European powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our policy to do so. It is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make preparations for our defense.” Observing that “[t]he political system of the allied powers is essentially different in this respect from America,” the president warned, “We owe it … to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those powers to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety…. It is impossible that the allied powers should extend their political system to any portion of either continent without endangering our peace and happiness; nor can anyone believe that our southern brethren, if left to themselves, would adopt it on their own accord.”16 It was a breathtaking assertion of hemispheric dominance, a message to the Europeans that the New World was now off limits to further imperial adventures, except of course those launched by the United States itself. Monroe had demarcated the entire hemisphere as an American security zone; European powers could enter at their own risk.","['annual', 'December 2, 1823', 'the present day']",monroe give public voice emerge hemispheric foreign policy seventh annual message december 2 1823 detail distinct principle foundation u.s hemispheric policy present day principle noncolonization arise response ongoing effort tsar assert claim northwest coast allude negotiation russia tsar ’s ukase monroe set matter unyielding principle “ continent free independent condition assume maintain henceforth consider subject future colonization european power ” bold statement give inability united state enforce unilaterally concept uncertain outcome south independence struggle course foreign policy independence point direction circumstance dictate stand take affirm immediately implicit support british navy principle rest change economic interest philosophy adam especially perceive change understand rely far certainty control british policy future bilateral agreement united state stand confidence later address monroe articulate second foundational pillar foreign relation principle nonintervention acknowledge sympathy american feel greek independence movement monroe emphasize united state struggle “ i]n war european power matter relate take comport policy right invade seriously menace resent injury preparation defense ” observe “ t]he political system ally power essentially different respect america ” president warn “ owe … candor amicable relation exist united state power declare consider attempt extend system portion hemisphere dangerous peace safety … impossible ally power extend political system portion continent endanger peace happiness believe southern brother leave adopt accord.”16 breathtaking assertion hemispheric dominance message europeans new world limit imperial adventure course launch united state monroe demarcate entire hemisphere security zone european power enter risk,233,[1823],1823,1,1825,1850
140,"The audacity of the president’s bold stand startled the courts of Europe. Surely, the Americans, so recently nearly destroyed by war, did not have either the power or the position to dictate hemispheric affairs. Yet the alignments of power and interests in both the Americas and in Europe had shifted dramatically since 1815, thereby making the president’s stand plausible. In fact, unbeknownst to Monroe at the time he gave his address, the British had communicated their resolute opposition to any plans by the Holy Alliance to intervene in the revolting Spanish colonies. In the so-called Polignac Memorandum, Canning had finally removed all doubts as to Britain’s unequivocal embrace of South American independence and the limits of its restorationist fervor.

To the surprise of European diplomats, the tsar agreed to repeal his ukase of 1821 banning Americans from offshore waters, established a southern boundary of Russian Alaska at 54 degrees, 40 minutes north latitude, and allowed Americans to land and take furs along unoccupied regions of the Northwest Coast. The deal constituted another major victory for American statecraft.","['April 1824', 'the previous July', '1821']",confront new anglo solidarity april 1824 tsar alexander capitulate u.s pressure northwest coast adams ’s warning previous july united state vigorously contest new colonial establishment combine president ’s public affirmation intention result convention 1824 surprise european diplomat tsar agree repeal ukase 1821 ban american offshore water establish southern boundary russian alaska 54 degree 40 minute north latitude allow american land fur unoccupied region northwest coast deal constitute major victory statecraft,70,"[1824, 1821]",1822,2,1825,1850
143,"James Monroe rapidly faded from the public mind upon leaving office in 1825. But under his leadership eight years of purposeful diplomacy had resulted in the promulgation of the benchmark principles of noncolonization and nonintervention, themselves best understood as the implicit goals of American foreign policymakers from the time of the War of Independence. Although Secretary of State John Quincy Adams had done much to establish the conditions necessary for the promulgation of doctrinal principles of American foreign relations, esteemed diplomatic historian and Adams biographer Samuel Flagg Bemis nonetheless affirms Monroe’s primary role: “The ‘most significant of all American state papers’ appropriately bears the name Monroe Doctrine.”18 The authority with which Monroe could pronounce his principles flowed from the stark transformation of the U.S. geopolitical position between 1815 and 1825. Fears of encirclement at the hands of Spain and Great Britain had given way to Spain’s cession of the Floridas and recognition of a transcontinental boundary between the United States and Hispanic America. Historic enmity with Great Britain had been replaced with burgeoning trade ties, resolution of the most pressing conflicts between the two states, further demarcation of the U.S.-Canadian border, and a joint occupancy agreement in the Pacific Northwest. The Anglo-American rapprochement blunted Russian pretensions to expansion southward from Alaska. Perhaps most importantly, South American independence from Spanish rule had been assured, and the danger of a European intervention to restore Spanish sovereignty had effectively been ended. In three-quarters of a century, Franklin’s vision of a durable union of the North American colonies achieving hemispheric preeminence had been realized.","['1825', 'eight years', 'between 1815 and 1825', 'three-quarters of a century']",james monroe rapidly fade public mind leave office 1825 leadership year purposeful diplomacy result promulgation benchmark principle noncolonization nonintervention best understand implicit goal foreign policymaker time war independence secretary state john quincy adams establish condition necessary promulgation doctrinal principle foreign relation esteem diplomatic historian adams biographer samuel flagg bemis nonetheless affirm monroe ’s primary role “ ‘ significant state papers’ appropriately bear monroe doctrine.”18 authority monroe pronounce principle flow stark transformation u.s geopolitical position 1815 1825 fear encirclement hand spain great britain give way spain ’s cession floridas recognition transcontinental boundary united state hispanic america historic enmity great britain replace burgeon trade tie resolution pressing conflict state demarcation u.s .- canadian border joint occupancy agreement pacific northwest anglo rapprochement blunt russian pretension expansion southward alaska importantly south independence spanish rule assure danger european intervention restore spanish sovereignty effectively end quarter century franklin ’s vision durable union north colony achieve hemispheric preeminence realize,152,[1825],1825,1,1850,1850
144,"Beyond the formal articulation of the foundational principles of U.S. hemispheric policy, the Monroe administration’s conduct of foreign affairs established crucial precedents for future presidents to refer to and stand upon when engaging in their own activist foreign policies. The First Seminole War and the controversy surrounding it demonstrated that framing foreign policy crises in ultranationalist terms could trump facts contrary to the official story and cast dissenters as unpatriotic, thereby emboldening future presidents to engage in foreign policy adventurism. In addition, the concession of the Texas claim in the Adams-Onis Treaty and the partial concession of the Oregon claim in the Free and Open Occupation Treaty of 1818 would later give rise to charges that the Monroe administration had sold out American interests at the negotiating table. Just as important, Monroe and Adams’s conception of an American security perimeter encompassing the entire Western Hemisphere in the long run had a profound influence on future policy. Jay Sexton observes, “[P]remised upon a curious mixture of imperial ambitions and perception of internal vulnerability, the national security of the United States required more than just the safety of its borders – it required an entire hemispheric political system conducive to its political system and economic practices.”19",['1818'],formal articulation foundational principle u.s hemispheric policy monroe administration ’s conduct foreign affair establish crucial precedent future president refer stand engage activist foreign policy seminole war controversy surround demonstrate frame foreign policy crisis ultranationalist term trump fact contrary official story cast dissenter unpatriotic embolden future president engage foreign policy adventurism addition concession texas claim adams onis treaty partial concession oregon claim free open occupation treaty 1818 later rise charge monroe administration sell interest negotiating table important monroe adams ’s conception security perimeter encompass entire western hemisphere long run profound influence future policy jay sexton observe “ p]remis curious mixture imperial ambition perception internal vulnerability national security united state require safety border – require entire hemispheric political system conducive political system economic practices.”19,122,[1818],1818,1,1825,1850

The newly independent states of South America were disappointed to discover that what seemed like an offer of multilateral cooperation in resisting foreign penetration was actually a statement of hemispheric unilateralism by the North American republic that saw itself as inherently superior to the states to the south. Political leaders in Washington would decide when and where to invoke the principles of noncolonization and nonintervention and assert them without the aid or consultation of the South American republics.

147,"The period 1815–61 looms especially large in U.S. history, a time of massive territorial and commercial expansion and dramatic technological change. This dynamic process of expansion, change, and outsized accomplishment gave rise to an outlook known as Manifest Destiny, the dominant ideology of that time. It is a term most often associated with the 1840s and most often attributed to the journalist and publisher John L. O’Sullivan.1 But it is appropriate to employ it for the entire period from the end of the War of 1812 to at least the beginning of the Civil War; in other words, the existence of the ideology predates the most commonly used term to describe it. As is the case with any ideology, Manifest Destiny, though oriented around a few basic concepts, did not belong exclusively to any one group or have one precise meaning. Perhaps it is best understood as a web of justifications, rationalizations, and idealizations designed to legitimate the seizing of North America (or at least a large portion of it) from its Native American residents and European claimants.",['the 1840s'],period 1815–61 loom especially large u.s history time massive territorial commercial expansion dramatic technological change dynamic process expansion change outsized accomplishment give rise outlook know manifest destiny dominant ideology time term associate 1840s attribute journalist publisher john l. o’sullivan.1 appropriate employ entire period end war 1812 beginning civil war word existence ideology predate commonly term describe case ideology manifest destiny orient basic concept belong exclusively group precise meaning best understand web justification rationalization idealization design legitimate seizing north america large portion native resident european claimant,85,[1840],1840,1,1850,1850
148,"In one sense, Manifest Destiny heralded the destiny of the United States to spread its limits throughout North America and perhaps the rest of the hemisphere. Rooted in Franklin’s continentalist vision in the 1750s, this outlook subsequently was modified by Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, and others; these changes, combined with the palpable successes experienced by the young nation, resulted in the vision morphing into a messianic conception of the American people as the chosen agents of God’s will. After 1815, having twice stood up militarily to the most powerful nation in the world, having expanded across North America, and having created a dynamic society built on a broadly (but by no means universally) shared freedom, many Americans began to feel that the country’s long-anticipated destiny was being realized before them. Nothing else could explain the astounding and rapid success of the United States as anything other than a part of a godly plan – or Divine Providence, the term commonly used. Each victory in battle, each technological breakthrough, each foreign revolution in the name of liberty and republicanism spoke to the American people as another sign of their chosen role as agents in God’s master plan. Manifest Destiny functioned as an enabling ideology, a potent mix of American patriotic nationalism, evangelical Christianity, and material self-interest.","['the 1750s', '1815', '–']",sense manifest destiny herald destiny united state spread limit north america rest hemisphere root franklin ’s continentalist vision 1750s outlook subsequently modify jefferson john quincy adams change combine palpable success experience young nation result vision morph messianic conception people choose agent god ’s 1815 have twice stand militarily powerful nation world have expand north america have create dynamic society build broadly means universally share freedom american begin feel country ’s long anticipate destiny realize explain astounding rapid success united state godly plan – divine providence term commonly victory battle technological breakthrough foreign revolution liberty republicanism speak people sign choose role agent god ’s master plan manifest destiny function enable ideology potent mix patriotic nationalism evangelical christianity material self interest,119,"[1750, 1815]",1782,2,1800,1800
149,"In its most basic form, the ideology of Manifest Destiny rested on three assumptions: the special moral virtue of the American people; their mission to redeem the world in the name of their own distinct concept of freedom; and their presumed destiny under Divine Providence to accomplish that mission. The facts of any particular case could be adapted to fit within these foundational assumptions. John Quincy Adams had demonstrated the power of this nationalist/imperialist narrative in defending Andrew Jackson from his critics in 1818–19. By the 1820s, many Americans looked back to the revolution as part of a sacred past en route to a seemingly boundless future.",['the 1820s'],basic form ideology manifest destiny rest assumption special moral virtue people mission redeem world distinct concept freedom presume destiny divine providence accomplish mission fact particular case adapt fit foundational assumption john quincy adams demonstrate power nationalist imperialist narrative defend andrew jackson critic 1818–19 1820s american look revolution sacred past en route seemingly boundless future,54,[1820],1820,1,1825,1850
150,"Even as the ideology of Manifest Destiny coalesced in the 1820s, it began to evolve into two distinct strands based on different readings of the nation’s sacred past and future. One school of Manifest Destiny remained closely tied to the Declaration of Independence and its promise of universal freedom and equality. To its adherents, the Declaration stood as the Magna Charta of American nationality; the ultimate realization of its principles constituted the essence of the American mission. In theory, the Declaration of Independence applied to people of all backgrounds, whatever qualms or uncertainties may have existed regarding how this fundamental human equality might be accommodated in practice.",['the 1820s'],ideology manifest destiny coalesce 1820 begin evolve distinct strand base different reading nation ’s sacred past future school manifest destiny remain closely tie declaration independence promise universal freedom equality adherent declaration stand magna charta nationality ultimate realization principle constitute essence mission theory declaration independence apply people background qualm uncertainty exist fundamental human equality accommodate practice,55,[1820],1820,1,1825,1850
151,"A second conception of Manifest Destiny emerged in the 1820s and gained strength thereafter. This conception rejected the universal application of the promises of the Declaration of Independence. Basing its belief on a traditional reading of the Bible, a new scientific consensus on the supposed truth of racial inequality, and a rapidly increasing economic and cultural interest in racial subordination, this view would energize the expansionist thrust to the southwest during this time. This second conception of Manifest Destiny connoted a romantic racial nationalism that hypothesized a putative Anglo-Saxon people as the prime movers of modern world history. Its conception of American destiny justified the enslavement of the African, the removal of the Indian, and the conquest of the Mexican. This version of the ideology of Manifest Destiny, unlike the ideology that informed the founding generation, had an explicitly racialist component. Only white people could enjoy the benefits of American freedom; nonwhite people were considered undeserving of equality. The conviction of racial superiority joined with assumptions regarding the superiority of Protestant Christianity, of the superiority of republican government, and of the superiority of free market capitalism to create a comprehensive worldview that informed the era, at least for one segment of the population.","['the 1820s', 'the era']",second conception manifest destiny emerge 1820 gain strength conception reject universal application promise declaration independence base belief traditional reading bible new scientific consensus suppose truth racial inequality rapidly increase economic cultural interest racial subordination view energize expansionist thrust southwest time second conception manifest destiny connote romantic racial nationalism hypothesize putative anglo saxon people prime mover modern world history conception destiny justify enslavement african removal indian conquest mexican version ideology manifest destiny unlike ideology inform founding generation explicitly racialist component white people enjoy benefit freedom nonwhite people consider undeserving equality conviction racial superiority join assumption superiority protestant christianity superiority republican government superiority free market capitalism create comprehensive worldview inform era segment population,111,[1820],1820,1,1825,1850
152,"These diverging notions of America’s apparent destiny only loosely correlated along free state–slave state lines. Many white Southerners remained staunch believers in the universality of the Declaration of Independence and continued to wish to see slavery ended even if they could not envision the transition to true racial egalitarianism. Just as many, if not more, white Northerners themselves rejected the radical implications of the Declaration of Independence in the name of maintaining a white imperial republic that countenanced slavery.

Yet it had been mostly contained in the early decades of the Union, only to appear with sudden pent-up fury during the Missouri debates in Congress, proliferating from that point forward and becoming more contentious with each successive expansionist controversy. The expansionist tendency, prominent from the start in U.S. history, accelerated in the 1820s. Americans were a restless, mobile people, with no limit to their ambitions. It was an age of boundless energy, boundless territory, and boundless optimism that the future would be better than the past. Yet the political union that was the key to its great success grew increasingly fragile.

154,"Any history of the antebellum American Empire between the end of the War of 1812 and the beginning of the Civil War must emphasize the critical importance of cotton. Cotton, and the activities related to its production and distribution, was both the single most important engine of national economic development during this time and a crucially important commodity in the emerging world economy. U.S. cotton exports, virtually nonexistent in the 1790s, by 1830 had reached $26 million per year and 40 percent of total exports, and by 1851, $112 million and 59 percent of exports.2 This radical shift had been driven by advances both in the production of cotton (most notably the cotton “gin”) and in the manufacture of cotton textiles and was given an unstoppable momentum by the endless demand for affordable machine-made cloth. Indeed, cotton exports did much to reduce the long-term negative trade balance of the United States during the era. Its importance was not confined to the South: Northern merchants, shippers, and insurers shared the wealth generated by the fiber. With cotton by far the greatest single source of national wealth during this time, the slaves who produced it represented the single largest source of capital.","['between the end of the War of 1812', 'the 1790s', '1830', '1851', 'the era']",history antebellum empire end war 1812 beginning civil war emphasize critical importance cotton cotton activity relate production distribution single important engine national economic development time crucially important commodity emerge world economy u.s cotton export virtually nonexistent 1790s 1830 reach 26 million year 40 percent total export 1851 112 million 59 percent exports.2 radical shift drive advance production cotton notably cotton “ gin ” manufacture cotton textile give unstoppable momentum endless demand affordable machine cloth cotton export reduce long term negative trade balance united state era importance confine south northern merchant shipper insurer share wealth generate fiber cotton far great single source national wealth time slave produce represent single large source capital,111,"[1812, 1790, 1830, 1851]",1821,4,1825,1850
155,"The global importance of American cotton to the textile revolution is hard to exaggerate. The cotton boom was a critical part of world history, a vital cog in the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. Brian Schoen observes, “By the beginning of the 19th century, a vast and intricate web of commerce already had created a regional, national, and global interest grounded in the raw cotton of the lower South.”3 Traditional views of nineteenth-century (especially post-1820) American foreign policy as being minimally involved in world affairs underestimate the degree to which cotton – and the slave labor system that produced it – deeply involved the United States in a crucially important historic event of its time: the textile revolution. Along the same lines the explosion of cotton production by a slave labor system was not a manifestation of regional “backwardness” as is sometimes suggested, but rather it was irrefutable evidence of the engagement of the cotton South in some of the most critical trends on the road to the modern world. The cotton empire benefited both large landowners and small farmers, each of whom stood to profit from the fiber. Its sudden, rapid movement across the South made moot notions that freed slaves might be “diffused” into sparsely populated western territories or colonized in faraway lands. By 1830, slavery had demonstrated its critical role in both national and global prosperity.","['the beginning of the 19th century', 'nineteenth-century', 'post-1820', '1830']",global importance cotton textile revolution hard exaggerate cotton boom critical world history vital cog beginning industrial revolution brian schoen observe “ beginning 19th century vast intricate web commerce create regional national global interest ground raw cotton low south.”3 traditional view nineteenth century especially post-1820 foreign policy minimally involve world affair underestimate degree cotton – slave labor system produce – deeply involve united state crucially important historic event time textile revolution line explosion cotton production slave labor system manifestation regional “ backwardness ” suggest irrefutable evidence engagement cotton south critical trend road modern world cotton empire benefit large landowner small farmer stand profit fiber sudden rapid movement south moot notion free slave “ diffuse ” sparsely populated western territory colonize faraway land 1830 slavery demonstrate critical role national global prosperity,129,"[1820, 1830]",1825,2,1850,1850
156,"The post–War of 1812 rapprochement with England had numerous aspects – cultural, strategic, and ideological – but more than any other factor, cotton thread bound the interests of the two states together. The United States went from supplying 0.16 percent of British cotton imports in the period 1786–90 to 53 percent by the period 1806–10, and 81 percent by the late 1840s.4 One might think that the position held by the United States during this time – as, in essence, a neocolonial source of raw material for the British economic empire – would have elicited the same fears of being resubordinated that dominated Anglo-American relations prior to 1812, but the successes in the war and the fabulous wealth generated by the cotton trade muted such objections.","['the late 1840s.4', 'this time –', 'prior to 1812']",post – war 1812 rapprochement england numerous aspect – cultural strategic ideological – factor cotton thread bind interest state united state go supply 0.16 percent british cotton import period 1786–90 53 percent period 1806–10 81 percent late 1840s.4 think position hold united state time – essence neocolonial source raw material british economic empire – elicit fear resubordinat dominate anglo relation prior 1812 success war fabulous wealth generate cotton trade mute objection,71,"[1840, 1812]",1826,2,1850,1850
157,"Progress in the form of the textile revolution and the wealth that it generated came at the cost of a greatly reinvigorated slave institution. Nearly matching the fertility of the white population, the 500,000 slaves of the 1790s became, by 1820, 1.5 million. The diminishing importance of slave labor to the tobacco, indigo, and rice trade dramatically reversed once it became clear that there existed an open-ended demand for cotton and the land to cultivate it. By the 1820s, many Southerners defended the institution of slavery as both morally right and economically invaluable. The profitability of cotton increased the value of slaves: By 1840, the price of an adult field hand approached $1,000 or more, a very large sum of money for the time. Even as the federal government dispatched the navy to suppress the slave trade, the importance of slavery increased. Once cotton became king, the issue of slavery was transformed from being a manageable, diminishing concern to the central controversy of the age. A rising tide of abolitionist agitation collided with a suddenly resurgent slave labor regime and an emerging proslavery ideology to match.","['the 1790s', '1820', 'the 1820s', '1840']","progress form textile revolution wealth generate come cost greatly reinvigorated slave institution nearly match fertility white population 500,000 slave 1790s 1820 1.5 million diminish importance slave labor tobacco indigo rice trade dramatically reverse clear exist open end demand cotton land cultivate 1820s southerner defend institution slavery morally right economically invaluable profitability cotton increase value slave 1840 price adult field hand approach 1,000 large sum money time federal government dispatch navy suppress slave trade importance slavery increase cotton king issue slavery transform manageable diminish concern central controversy age rise tide abolitionist agitation collide suddenly resurgent slave labor regime emerge proslavery ideology match",101,"[1790, 1820, 1820, 1840]",1818,4,1825,1850
158,"Domestically, the cotton boom accelerated the removal of Native Americans from their ancient homelands in the southeastern United States. In the years after the War of 1812, Andrew Jackson became a one-man removal force. At times acting on his own authority, between 1816 and 1818 Jackson negotiated five land cessions from the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw peoples. This was in addition to the massive transfer of Creek lands contained in the 1814 Treaty of Fort Jackson. James Monroe’s formal adoption in 1817 of a removal policy based on gaining the consent of the subject tribes seemed to offer the hope that the process would be done humanely. By the 1820s, however, many tribes would no longer consent to part with their lands, much to the consternation of the southern states. The discovery of gold in Georgia fueled the determination of locals to remove Indians by any means necessary. Those who defended the rights of Indians, be it the federal government or Christian missionaries, felt the outrage of Georgians angry over outsiders meddling in state affairs. In contrast to the administration of John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson’s withdrew federal support of Indian treaty rights and made it clear that it would not let signed treaties stand in the way of removal. The ethnic cleansing of the southeast culminated in the Indian Removal Act of 1830 stipulating the forced removal of any tribes that refused to leave voluntarily.","['the years', '1817', 'the 1820s', '1830']",domestically cotton boom accelerate removal native american ancient homeland southeastern united state year war 1812 andrew jackson man removal force time act authority 1816 1818 jackson negotiate land cession cherokee choctaw chickasaw people addition massive transfer creek land contain 1814 treaty fort jackson james monroe ’s formal adoption 1817 removal policy base gain consent subject tribe offer hope process humanely 1820 tribe longer consent land consternation southern state discovery gold georgia fuel determination local remove indian mean necessary defend right indian federal government christian missionary feel outrage georgian angry outsider meddle state affair contrast administration john quincy adams andrew jackson ’s withdraw federal support indian treaty right clear let sign treaty stand way removal ethnic cleansing southeast culminate indian removal act 1830 stipulate force removal tribe refuse leave voluntarily,129,"[1817, 1820, 1830]",1822,3,1825,1850
159,"The harshness of removal, particularly of tribes such as the Cherokees that had taken steps to become agriculturalists, panged the consciences of many Americans, and the Removal Act passed by only a one-vote margin in the Senate. Yet the rhetoric of progress trumped the reality of Native American suffering. Jackson gave expression to this in his second annual message to Congress in December 1830: Acknowledging that “humanity has often wept over the fate of the aborigines of the country,” Jackson urged Congress to see the disappearance of the tribes in a positive light: “What good man would prefer a country covered with forests and ranged by a few thousand savages to our extensive Republic, studded with cities, towns, and prosperous farms, embellished with all the improvements which art can devise or industry execute, occupied by more than 12,000,000 happy people, and filled with all the blessings of liberty, civilization, and religion?” Jackson argued that removal was the only means for Indians to avoid extermination at the hands of expansionist whites, concluding that “the policy of the General Government toward the red man is not only liberal but generous” for it “kindly offers him a new home, and proposes to pay the whole expense of his removal and settlement.”5 Indian removal represented another major expansion of federal power into the realm of imperial population management. By 1840 approximately 125,000 Native Americans had been removed by the federal government to new lands in the Oklahoma territory. The rage for cotton cultivation transformed the states of the Deep South, utterly changing their character in little over a decade, as had occurred earlier in Ohio. Plantation agriculture spread through the woodland homelands of Native America, as large profits from the trade resulted in the creation of elegant estates designed to advertise the great wealth and prestige of their owners.","['annual', 'December 1830', '1840', 'little over a decade']","harshness removal particularly tribe cherokee take step agriculturalist pang conscience american removal act pass vote margin senate rhetoric progress trump reality native suffering jackson give expression second annual message congress december 1830 acknowledge “ humanity weep fate aborigine country ” jackson urge congress disappearance tribe positive light good man prefer country cover forest range thousand savage extensive republic stud city town prosperous farm embellish improvement art devise industry execute occupy 12,000,000 happy people fill blessing liberty civilization religion jackson argue removal mean indian avoid extermination hand expansionist white conclude “ policy general government red man liberal generous ” “ kindly offer new home propose pay expense removal settlement.”5 indian removal represent major expansion federal power realm imperial population management 1840 approximately 125,000 native american remove federal government new land oklahoma territory rage cotton cultivation transform state deep south utterly change character little decade occur earlier ohio plantation agriculture spread woodland homeland native america large profit trade result creation elegant estate design advertise great wealth prestige owner",166,"[1830, 1840]",1835,2,1850,1850
160,"The explosion of cotton production and its importance to national (and international) prosperity were boosted by revolutionary developments in transportation and communication that both bound the Union more tightly into a single economic unit and made it more closely tied to global markets. The railroad proved the most important of these innovations. Although the first railroad was founded in England in 1825, by 1830 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had begun work on a route west roughly along that first surveyed by Washington more than seventy-five years earlier. Aided by English financiers and minimal right-of-way acquisition costs, American railroads exploded. By 1860, more than thirty thousand miles of track had been laid in the United States, more than in all of Europe combined. This caused a radical drop in the cost of transporting bulk goods, making formerly distant places quite accessible. This, in turn, made American goods on the world market more competitive. The railroad, one of the key elements in the global transition to the modern world, first achieved prominence in the United States. It transformed the edifice of union into a structure built of iron and steel.","['1825', '1830', 'seventy-five years earlier', '1860']",explosion cotton production importance national international prosperity boost revolutionary development transportation communication bind union tightly single economic unit closely tie global market railroad prove important innovation railroad found england 1825 1830 baltimore ohio railroad begin work route west roughly survey washington seventy year earlier aid english financier minimal right way acquisition cost railroad explode 1860 thirty thousand mile track lay united state europe combine cause radical drop cost transport bulk good make distant place accessible turn good world market competitive railroad key element global transition modern world achieve prominence united state transform edifice union structure build iron steel,98,"[1825, 1830, 1860]",1838,3,1850,1850

Oceangoing ships, not facing the necessity of navigating upstream, evolved more slowly, but by the 1850s a combination of American steamships and sailing vessels patrolled the world’s oceans and carried its mail.

162,"The period 1820–60 also saw a spate of canal building. Starting with virtually no man-made waterways in 1815, by 1860 the nation had approximately three thousand miles of canals, binding the Union into a single economic entity in much the same way railroads did. Spurred by the efforts of DeWitt Clinton, the state of New York built a 358-mile canal connecting Buffalo and Albany between 1817 and 1825.

163,"Of all the revolutionary technological developments of the age, the invention of the magnetic telegraph had perhaps the greatest long-term impact. It was devised by Samuel F. B. Morse, a noted painter-turned-inventor and son of Jedidiah Morse, whose 1790 text American Geography endeavored to catalogue and publicize the vast spaces of North America even as it imagined all of it as part of the United States. It was the genius of his son, however, that shrank that geography to manageable size. In only a few decades, the United States went from a country where a message could travel no faster than by horseback to widespread communication over a wire at the speed of light. It represented the quantum leap in communications, making all future innovations mere refinements. Like the railroad, the telegraph first became pervasive in the United States. By 1860, nearly fifty thousand miles of telegraph wire added another layer of networks binding the Union together. It is worth noting as well that the federal government allocated $30,000 for construction of the first telegraph line between Baltimore and Washington, as private investors proved unwilling to take the risk on the novel technology. “What hath God wrought?” Morse famously wondered on the first telegraph message; it is a question that might well have been applied to this entire era of American history.6","['1790', 'only a few decades', '1860']","revolutionary technological development age invention magnetic telegraph great long term impact devise samuel f. b. morse note painter turn inventor son jedidiah morse 1790 text geography endeavor catalogue publicize vast space north america imagine united state genius son shrink geography manageable size decade united state go country message travel fast horseback widespread communication wire speed light represent quantum leap communication make future innovation mere refinement like railroad telegraph pervasive united state 1860 nearly thousand mile telegraph wire add layer network bind union worth note federal government allocate 30,000 construction telegraph line baltimore washington private investor prove unwilling risk novel technology “ hath god work ” morse famously wonder telegraph message question apply entire era history.6",115,"[1790, 1860]",1825,2,1850,1850
164,"The revolutions in transportation and communications shrank the vastness of the U.S. continental empire into an increasingly manageable space and linked them ever more tightly into the emerging global market. Railroads, steamships, canals, and telegraphs provided layers of integrated networks that proved critically important in the creation of a unified nation. Although Jefferson doubted that the great expanse of the continent could be bound together as one nation, the technologies of steam and telegraphy made the creation of a national economic, information, and cultural entity more easily united than had been the thirteen colonies. Expansion might truly have no limit in an age of seemingly magical innovation. The promise of one large, internal market with rapid transport and communication capabilities gave the United States an enormous advantage in dealing with the world beyond its borders. William Gilpin, protégé of Jackson and one of the more prominent apostles of Manifest Destiny, reflected the optimism of the age when he wrote in 1846, “The untransacted destiny of the American people is to subdue the continent – to rush over this vast field to the Pacific Ocean … to regenerate superannuated nations – … to confirm the destiny of the human race – to carry the career of mankind to its culminating point – to cause a stagnant people to be reborn – … to absolve the curse that weighs down humanity, and to shed blessings round the world!”7","['1846', '–']",revolution transportation communication shrink vastness u.s continental empire increasingly manageable space link tightly emerge global market railroad steamship canal telegraphs provide layer integrate network prove critically important creation unified nation jefferson doubt great expanse continent bind nation technology steam telegraphy creation national economic information cultural entity easily united thirteen colony expansion truly limit age seemingly magical innovation promise large internal market rapid transport communication capability give united state enormous advantage deal world border william gilpin protégé jackson prominent apostle manifest destiny reflect optimism age write 1846 “ untransacted destiny people subdue continent – rush vast field pacific ocean … regenerate superannuated nation – … confirm destiny human race – carry career mankind culminating point – because stagnant people reborn – … absolve curse weigh humanity shed blessing round world!”7,129,[1846],1846,1,1850,1850
165,"All of these developments in transportation and communication occurred against a backdrop of an industrial “takeoff” period for American industry, which, if not the dramatic beginning it is sometimes thought to be, nevertheless marked a decisive acceleration of a preexisting process, putting the United States on a trajectory to be the workshop of the world by the 1870s.

166,"The annexation and absorption of the vast spaces of North America into a single continental empire were not the only way Americans expanded their civilization and their way of life in the nineteenth century. They also expanded into the world beyond the limits of North America. From colonial times, Americans had extensive commercial contacts with the Caribbean, Europe, and the Mediterranean. Beginning in the 1780s, they began to push into the Pacific and toward Asia, motivated by the same reasons that drove continental expansion – the search for new and abundant sources of wealth. American expansionism during the period 1815–61 encompassed a global expansionism along an undifferentiated frontier, for even though it surely took different tools to navigate the Pacific Ocean as opposed to the Oregon Trail, the search for new and accessible sources of wealth, be it territorial, commercial, mineral, or natural, drove both tendencies. Historian Frederick Jackson Turner’s well-known “frontier thesis” helped to create the impression of American expansionism as a linear progression across the continent in the nineteenth century. However, this observation distorts the nature of expansionism by omitting the global aspects of that expansionist process, whose tentacles had begun reaching to the far corners of the globe almost from the start of the republic. American expansionism, far from being confined to the territories of North America, is best conceived of as proceeding across a variety of opportunity frontiers – some landed, some watery, but all of them in pursuit of gain, be it found in lush fields of grain, nuggets of gold, bolts of silk, the carcasses of whales, or the harvesting of souls. Americans expanded for all of these reasons, but in almost every case, they carried with them an ideology of progress and civilization and an unshakable sense of themselves and their civilization as the cutting edge of human endeavor. More than a mere “westward movement,” it was a globalized expansionist process. The capitalist imperative for profit that lured Americans to the Ohio Country in the 1750s also took them to Hawaii, China, and beyond.","['the nineteenth century', 'the 1780s', 'the nineteenth century', 'the 1750s']",annexation absorption vast space north america single continental empire way american expand civilization way life nineteenth century expand world limit north america colonial time american extensive commercial contact caribbean europe mediterranean begin 1780s begin push pacific asia motivate reason drive continental expansion – search new abundant source wealth expansionism period 1815–61 encompass global expansionism undifferentiated frontier surely take different tool navigate pacific ocean oppose oregon trail search new accessible source wealth territorial commercial mineral natural drive tendency historian frederick jackson turner ’s know “ frontier thesis ” help create impression expansionism linear progression continent nineteenth century observation distort nature expansionism omit global aspect expansionist process tentacle begin reach far corner globe start republic expansionism far confine territory north america best conceive proceed variety opportunity frontier – land watery pursuit gain find lush field grain nugget gold bolt silk carcass whale harvesting soul american expand reason case carry ideology progress civilization unshakable sense civilization cutting edge human endeavor mere “ westward movement ” globalize expansionist process capitalist imperative profit lure american ohio country 1750s take hawaii china,176,"[1780, 1750]",1765,2,1775,1800
167,"The brave, ambitious – and, at times, rapacious – merchants and mariners who put their lives and fortunes on the line in pursuit of their dreams served as the primary agents of the American market empire. Although the movement of American pioneers across North American frontier has long been celebrated – Frederick Jackson Turner thought that movement the key to understanding all of American history – it must be recalled that Americans demonstrated themselves to be even more capable on the sea than on the land. During the first half of the nineteenth century, the United States reigned as the leading commercial carrier in the world. Americans built the best and fastest vessels, commanded by the most daring and able commanders, and staffed by the most experienced crews. By the 1840s, the United States boasted a fleet of ten thousand vessels and an estimated 180,000 merchant sailors. Much as Thomas Paine had envisioned in “Common Sense,” this seagoing arm of the empire had an enormous impact on world commerce, reaching virtually everywhere there were profits to be made. It made the United States a formidable presence in the markets of the world.","['–', 'the first half of the nineteenth century', 'the 1840s']","brave ambitious – time rapacious – merchant mariner life fortune line pursuit dream serve primary agent market empire movement pioneer north frontier long celebrate – frederick jackson turner think movement key understanding history – recall american demonstrate capable sea land half nineteenth century united state reign lead commercial carrier world american build good fast vessel command daring able commander staff experienced crew 1840s united state boast fleet thousand vessel estimated 180,000 merchant sailor thomas paine envision “ common sense ” seagoing arm empire enormous impact world commerce reach virtually profit united state formidable presence market world",96,[1840],1840,1,1850,1850
168,"The creation of an American empire of commerce depended upon the creation of an American empire of the seas. Americans aimed not only to trade with foreign states but also to redefine the terms of commercial intercourse. Americans sought to open the markets of the world to trade, although not in order to push for “free trade” in the modern sense. The negotiation of commercial reciprocity treaties with foreign states functioned as the main tool to open markets available to American presidents; the Monroe, Adams, and Jackson administrations made particular use of it. The national government also made a sustained and ultimately successful effort to reopen the valuable British West Indies trade to American shipping.

169,"American whaling reached the peak of its profitability in the 1850s, before new sources of lamp oil and the Civil War decimated the fleet. In the 1840s, more than seven hundred American whale ships sailed the seas, comprising roughly 80 percent of the world’s total. Thousands of sailors staffed this impressive fleet, which killed whales in every ocean in the world. By the early to mid-nineteenth century, however, the not yet fully discovered Pacific and Southern Oceans yielded most of the catch. The exploits of the whalers provided valuable new knowledge about the world’s oceans. Analogous to the fur traders, whalers roamed the high seas, explored distant lands, charted unknown waters, and went places no American (or in some cases, no person) had ever gone in pursuit of fertile hunting grounds. Whalers had been among the first Americans to visit the Hermit Kingdom of Japan and had provided Commodore Perry with valuable intelligence that he used on his mission to “open” Japan to the world. The whaling industry had been centered in colonial days on Nantucket Island off the coast of Massachusetts, but by the 1820s it had moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts.","['the 1850s', 'the 1840s', 'the early to mid-nineteenth century', 'days', 'the 1820s']",whaling reach peak profitability 1850 new source lamp oil civil war decimate fleet 1840s seven whale ship sail sea comprise roughly 80 percent world ’s total thousand sailor staff impressive fleet kill whale ocean world early mid nineteenth century fully discover pacific southern ocean yield catch exploit whaler provide valuable new knowledge world ’s ocean analogous fur trader whaler roam high sea explore distant land chart unknown water go place case person go pursuit fertile hunting ground whaler american visit hermit kingdom japan provide commodore perry valuable intelligence mission “ open japan world whaling industry center colonial day nantucket island coast massachusetts 1820 move new bedford massachusetts,107,"[1850, 1840, 1820]",1837,3,1850,1850
170,"The modern sailing vessels that comprised the whaling fleet employed the most traditional methods in hunting their prey. They relied on stalking the whale from a small boat, hooking it with a harpoon and rope, and then holding on for dear life until the whale expired from exhaustion. Laboriously rowing back to the mother ship, the crews hauled the carcass up alongside the boat, where its blubbery skin was peeled from its body and its skeleton scavenged for bone. A giant pot called the “try works” was then used to cook the blubber down to yield a fine oil, perfect for lamps or for lubricants. A dangerous and frequently cruel business, whaling remained mostly hidden from public view. Yet by the 1850s it had become the third-leading American industry by value, trailing only textiles and shoemaking.",['the 1850s'],modern sailing vessel comprise whaling fleet employ traditional method hunt prey rely stalk whale small boat hook harpoon rope hold dear life whale expire exhaustion laboriously row mother ship crew haul carcass alongside boat blubbery skin peel body skeleton scavenge bone giant pot call “ try work ” cook blubber yield fine oil perfect lamp lubricant dangerous frequently cruel business whaling remain hide public view 1850 lead industry value trail textile shoemaking,72,[1850],1850,1,1875,1900
171,"The allure and adventure of a life at sea inspired young Americans as much as did the appeal of western lands. It launched the career of one of the nation’s most noted authors, Herman Melville. Restless and lacking any immediate prospects for advancement, at age twenty-one Melville left his native New York in 1840 for the adventure of a two-year whaling voyage on the Acushnet out of New Bedford. Finding the harshness of shipboard life unbearable, Melville deserted, spending a few weeks on the island of Nuka Hiva in the Marquesas group, the same island that briefly had been annexed to the United States in 1813 by Commodore David Porter at the command of the USS Essex. The Madison administration quickly disavowed this first example in U.S. history of the annexation of noncontiguous territory. Now Nuka Hiva would be colonized in a literary sense, as the place where one of America’s greatest novelists and interpreters would have his most formative experience, an encounter with a different type of freedom by a man from the land of the free. Melville’s brief idyll of sexual and psychological liberation on Nuka Hiva left him saddened by the damage being wrought on Pacific Islanders by the Euro-American invasion, especially by the missionaries. This fostered in him the ambivalence about the Euro-American way of life that is reflected in much of his writing. Enlisting on board an American naval vessel as a means to return to the United States, he proceeded to write two novels of his adventures – Typee and Omoo – both of which sold well and did much to form the initial impression of the Pacific world and its people in the popular mind. In 1851, Melville published a more ambitious work, Moby-Dick, or the Whale. Unlike his earlier works, Moby-Dick did not sell well upon release – only about five hundred copies – and endured harsh reviews by critics who lacked an appreciation for Melville’s ironic tale of Manifest Destiny and its contradictions set on the watery stage of the high seas. Melville centers the action on the whale ship the Pequod (named for the Indian tribe nearly exterminated by the Puritans in the seventeenth century), manned by a multiracial, multicultural crew commanded by white officers, a sort of floating plantation extracting wealth from the sea ruled by the imperious Captain Ahab. The Pequod’s three harpooners – and therefore the most important members of the hunt – are Polynesian, African, and Native American, whose traditional hunting skills are now being harnessed to the needs of the modern American mercantile empire. Moby-Dick is primarily a parable of Manifest Destiny afloat; its catastrophic ending is a foreshadowing of the disaster awaiting a civilization whose people will acknowledge no limit to their acquisitiveness.","['age twenty-one', '1840', 'two-year', 'a few weeks', '1813', '1851', 'the seventeenth century', 'three harpooners –', '–']",allure adventure life sea inspire young american appeal western land launch career nation ’s note author herman melville restless lack immediate prospect advancement age melville leave native new york 1840 adventure year whaling voyage acushnet new bedford find harshness shipboard life unbearable melville desert spend week island nuka hiva marquesas group island briefly annex united state 1813 commodore david porter command uss essex madison administration quickly disavow example u.s history annexation noncontiguous territory nuka hiva colonize literary sense place america ’s great novelist interpreter formative experience encounter different type freedom man land free melville ’s brief idyll sexual psychological liberation nuka hiva leave sadden damage work pacific islander euro invasion especially missionary foster ambivalence euro way life reflect writing enlist board naval vessel means return united state proceed write novel adventure – typee omoo – sell form initial impression pacific world people popular mind 1851 melville publish ambitious work moby dick whale unlike early work moby dick sell release – copy – endure harsh review critic lack appreciation melville ’s ironic tale manifest destiny contradiction set watery stage high sea melville center action whale ship pequod name indian tribe nearly exterminate puritan seventeenth century man multiracial multicultural crew command white officer sort float plantation extract wealth sea rule imperious captain ahab pequod ’s harpooner – important member hunt – polynesian african native traditional hunting skill harness need modern mercantile empire moby dick primarily parable manifest destiny afloat catastrophic ending foreshadowing disaster await civilization people acknowledge limit acquisitiveness,247,"[1840, 1813, 1851]",1835,3,1850,1850
172,"Protestant missionaries loomed nearly as important as the whalers in the discovery and exploration of the Pacific Ocean’s vast spaces. These self-styled “fishers of men” spread, like the whalers, to the far reaches of the world (including the far reaches of North America) in an effort to spread the word of God, save the heathen from Hell, and revitalize Christianity at home. The origin of the American missionary movement is to be found in a prophetic vision experienced by a Massachusetts college student to spread the gospel to the world. This led in 1810 to the formation of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), which became the vehicle for sending the first wave of missionaries abroad. Soon the Baptists became the first of many Christian sects to send their followers to foreign lands to do God’s work. A major part of the nation’s redemptionist mission, missionaries functioned as the spiritual tip of the American spear in much the same way that whalers served as the economic tip. Hundreds of dedicated and determined young men and women went forth to spread the Good News of Christ and American progress to a presumably benighted world. The certainty of their righteousness matched the intensity of their commitment. For the most part, American missionaries suffered none of the modern doubts regarding the virtues of progress or the superiority of Christianity over other faiths. They combined evangelical neo-Puritan Christianity with American nationalism in one neat package, and they spread it with a dedication and glad-heartedness reflected in their letters and diary entries.",['1810'],protestant missionary loom nearly important whaler discovery exploration pacific ocean ’s vast space self style “ fisher man ” spread like whaler far reach world include far reach north america effort spread word god save heathen hell revitalize christianity home origin missionary movement find prophetic vision experience massachusetts college student spread gospel world lead 1810 formation board commissioner foreign mission abcfm vehicle send wave missionary abroad soon baptist christian sect send follower foreign land god ’s work major nation ’s redemptionist mission missionary function spiritual tip spear way whaler serve economic tip hundred dedicated determine young man woman go forth spread good news christ progress presumably benighted world certainty righteousness match intensity commitment missionary suffer modern doubt virtue progress superiority christianity faith combine evangelical neo puritan christianity nationalism neat package spread dedication glad heartedness reflect letter diary entry,138,[1810],1810,1,1825,1850
173,"American missionaries made their presence felt throughout the Pacific, although their actual success in propagating Christianity proved limited. China proved to be especially disappointing in this regard, where very few embraced the preaching of the gospel and most ignored it. Perhaps the most enduring impact of Christianity on China was via the personage of Hung Hsiu-chu’an, who for a time had studied under an American missionary and found inspiration in the idea of Jesus as a prophet of the oppressed. In 1851, Hung began to have visions of a peasant uprising to overthrow the Manchu dynasty. What became known as the Tai-Ping Rebellion stands as one of the greatest disasters in Chinese history, costing an estimated twenty million lives before finally being suppressed in the 1860s. It contributed immeasurably to the slide of China into anarchy and warlordism that would plague it for decades. The Western powers, at first sympathetic to a movement they hoped would further open China to them, soon came to fear the violence and anarchy of the revolt as a threat to commerce. The American commissioner Humphrey Marshall, rightly or wrongly, believed the British sought to weaken the Manchus in the name of colonizing China and took steps to support the emperor if only to assure continued U.S. commercial access. Thus was born the idea of America as China’s “special friend,” shielding it from the exploitative aims of Britain, Russia, and France.10","['1851', 'the Manchu dynasty', 'the 1860s', 'decades']",missionary presence feel pacific actual success propagate christianity prove limited china prove especially disappointing regard embrace preaching gospel ignore enduring impact christianity china personage hung hsiu chu’an time study missionary find inspiration idea jesus prophet oppress 1851 hang begin vision peasant uprising overthrow manchu dynasty know tai ping rebellion stand great disaster chinese history cost estimate million life finally suppress 1860s contribute immeasurably slide china anarchy warlordism plague decade western power sympathetic movement hop open china soon come fear violence anarchy revolt threat commerce commissioner humphrey marshall rightly wrongly believe british seek weaken manchus colonize china take step support emperor assure continue u.s commercial access bear idea america china ’s “ special friend ” shield exploitative aim britain russia france.10,120,"[1851, 1860]",1856,2,1875,1900
174,"One place American missionaries did enjoy conspicuous success was in Hawaii. Americans missionaries and whalers came together to secure the Hawaiian Islands as an American outpost. The Hawaiian archipelago had become known to the world only in the 1770s, thanks to the voyages of Captain James Cook of Great Britain. American whalers had been visiting the islands since the 1790s, eventually establishing Lahaina on the island of Maui as the center of the American Pacific whaling enterprise. However, the turning point occurred in 1819, when the first wave of American missionaries arrived in Hawaii led by Congregationalist minister Hiram Bingham. The missionaries soon established themselves in the role of protectors of the Hawaiians, including from the depredations of whalers on shore leave. The raucous and randy crews arrived ashore with money in their pockets and debauchery in their heads, and they devastated the remnants of the traditional Hawaiian culture that they encountered. One American missionary commented on how shore liberty became synonymous with licentiousness, to the catastrophe of native culture: “[T]he whole nation is rotten with licentiousness.

175,"The American missionary community precipitated the circumstances leading to the establishment in 1842 of the de facto protectorate over the islands known as the Tyler Doctrine. Fears that France aimed to seize Hawaii for itself prompted this audacious extension of the Monroe Doctrine. The French threat arose in large part owing to the actions of the American missionaries, who in 1839 had urged King Kamehameha III to forbid the practice of Catholicism on the islands and stop further entry by priests. In response to this provocation, French warships on the scene blockaded Honolulu and threatened bombardment, ultimately compelling the king to sign a treaty protecting the Catholic faith and the rights of its French practitioners on the islands, as well as gaining favorable tariff treatment for French imports.","['1842', '1839']",missionary community precipitate circumstance lead establishment 1842 de facto protectorate island know tyler doctrine fear france aim seize hawaii prompt audacious extension monroe doctrine french threat arise large owe action missionary 1839 urge king kamehameha iii forbid practice catholicism island stop entry priest response provocation french warship scene blockade honolulu threaten bombardment ultimately compel king sign treaty protect catholic faith right french practitioner island gain favorable tariff treatment french import,70,"[1842, 1839]",1840,2,1850,1850
176,"American missionaries sounded the alarm, petitioning both Congress and the Van Buren administration for help, but to no avail. When the avid expansionist John Tyler acceded to the presidency after the early death of William Henry Harrison, the American Board of Commissioners sent the Reverend Hiram Bingham to Washington to plead for protection of both Hawaii and the missionaries. Among the most respected members of the missionaries in Hawaii, Bingham gained personal audiences with both Secretary of State Daniel Webster and President Tyler to detail the threat posed to Hawaii by French and British incursions. Highlighting the threat posed by the British proved especially useful in getting government action, be the territory in question Hawaii or Texas. Webster was especially concerned about the threat to American missionaries in far-off lands, and he affirmed in 1842 that “[t]he United States … are more interested in the fate of the islands and of their government than any other nation can be” and therefore demanded “that the Government of the Sandwich Islands ought to be respected; that no power ought either to take possession of the island as a conquest, or for the purpose of colonization, and that no power ought to seek for any undue control of the existing Government, or any exclusive privileges in matters of commerce.”13 A follow-up mission in 1842 sent by King Kamehameha III – a mission consisting of an esteemed prince, Timoteo Haalilio, and American missionary and royal confidant William Richards – aimed to secure diplomatic recognition and a commercial treaty with the United States. Haalilio’s dark skin made the Tyler administration reluctant to engage him publicly for fear of setting what it saw as the bad precedent of negotiating with black diplomats. Nevertheless, the lobbying of John Quincy Adams and others, combined with the tacit threat that if the United States did not lend its support then the Hawaiians would seek the protection of the British, ultimately prompted Tyler to act. In the end, the fear of British encroachment on the islands trumped Tyler’s reluctance to receive a dark-skinned diplomat.","['1842', '1842']",missionary sound alarm petition congress van buren administration help avail avid expansionist john tyler accede presidency early death william henry harrison board commissioner send reverend hiram bingham washington plead protection hawaii missionary respected member missionary hawaii bingham gain personal audience secretary state daniel webster president tyler detail threat pose hawaii french british incursion highlight threat pose british prove especially useful get government action territory question hawaii texas webster especially concerned threat missionary far land affirm 1842 “ t]he united state … interested fate island government nation ” demand “ government sandwich island ought respect power ought possession island conquest purpose colonization power ought seek undue control exist government exclusive privilege matter commerce.”13 follow mission 1842 send king kamehameha iii – mission consist esteemed prince timoteo haalilio missionary royal confidant william richard – aim secure diplomatic recognition commercial treaty united state haalilio ’ dark skin tyler administration reluctant engage publicly fear set see bad precedent negotiate black diplomat lobbying john quincy adams combine tacit threat united state lend support hawaiian seek protection british ultimately prompt tyler act end fear british encroachment island trump tyler ’s reluctance receive dark skinned diplomat,189,"[1842, 1842]",1842,2,1850,1850
177,"President Tyler, building on Webster’s earlier statement, clarified the U.S. position on Hawaii in a special message to Congress in 1842. The mood was paternalistic: “Just emerging from a state of barbarism, the Government of the islands is as yet feeble, but its dispositions appear to be just and pacific.” However, with 80 percent or more of the vessels visiting Hawaii being American, and given the strategic importance of the islands and the recent annexation of Tahiti by the French and New Zealand by the British, Tyler did not waffle. Claiming that the United States “seeks … no peculiar advantages, no exclusive control over the Hawaiian government, but is content with its independent existence and anxiously wishes for its security and prosperity,” Tyler warned other nations not to attempt to compromise its autonomy. Those who challenged this policy would face “a decided remonstrance.”14 In 1849, Secretary of State John Clayton echoed the determination to maintain a firm foothold on Hawaii: “The U.S. do [sic] not want the islands, but will not permit any other nation to have them.”15 From this affirmation of doctrine, application soon followed. In the 1840s and 1850s, the U.S. presence proliferated. At the urging of his American advisers, between 1845 and 1855 King Kamehameha III initiated the Mahele, converting the informal land tenure practices of Hawaii into the Anglo-American system of recorded fee simple holdings. Now foreign investors could feel secure about their investments. The result was that by the 1860s, Americans owned much of the best agricultural lands, devoting them to plantation-style sugar cultivation for the mainland market. Long before Hawaii was formally annexed in 1898, it had been Americanized and brought into the U.S. sphere.","['1842', '1849', 'the 1840s and 1850s', 'between 1845 and 1855', 'the 1860s', '1898']",president tyler build webster ’s early statement clarify u.s position hawaii special message congress 1842 mood paternalistic emerge state barbarism government island feeble disposition appear pacific ” 80 percent vessel visit hawaii give strategic importance island recent annexation tahiti french new zealand british tyler waffle claim united state “ seek … peculiar advantage exclusive control hawaiian government content independent existence anxiously wish security prosperity ” tyler warn nation attempt compromise autonomy challenge policy face “ decide remonstrance.”14 1849 secretary state john clayton echo determination maintain firm foothold hawaii “ u.s sic want island permit nation them.”15 affirmation doctrine application soon follow 1840s 1850 u.s presence proliferate urging adviser 1845 1855 king kamehameha iii initiate mahele convert informal land tenure practice hawaii anglo system record fee simple holding foreign investor feel secure investment result 1860s american own good agricultural land devote plantation style sugar cultivation mainland market long hawaii formally annex 1898 americanized bring u.s sphere,155,"[1842, 1849, 1860, 1898]",1862,4,1875,1900
178,"The national government gave critical assistance to the American commercial penetration of the Asia-Pacific world. Although the federal government was given explicit control of foreign affairs by the Constitution, the limits of its foreign policy power remained uncertain for decades. No one disputed the government’s power to declare war and to make treaties, including commercial agreements, with other states. But how much of a role should Washington play in defending the personal interests of Americans abroad? Daniel Webster’s guarantee of the safety of American missionaries, little noticed at the time, represented a significant expansion of national authority. Yet even under the Articles of Confederation, the central government took it upon itself to defend the rights of Americans abroad. This included efforts to recover private claims against foreign states for ship seizures and its ongoing campaign to garner compensation for slaves liberated by British forces in both the War of Independence and the War of 1812. From there it came to seem natural that Americans abroad might expect the support of their government in controversies with foreign states. This at times included the naval bombardment of locales deemed to have violated the rights of Americans, as occurred in the Sumatran town of Quallah Battoo in 1832. American naval commander Charles Wilkes, recognizing its importance to national prosperity, deemed whaling so important as to merit federal support. Insofar as the benefits of whaling “are spread through the whole union” it followed that it “would seem to recommend it to the especial protection and fostering care of the government.”16","['decades', '1832']",national government give critical assistance commercial penetration asia pacific world federal government give explicit control foreign affair constitution limit foreign policy power remain uncertain decade dispute government ’s power declare war treaty include commercial agreement state role washington play defend personal interest american abroad daniel webster ’s guarantee safety missionary little notice time represent significant expansion national authority article confederation central government take defend right american abroad include effort recover private claim foreign state ship seizure ongoing campaign garner compensation slave liberate british force war independence war 1812 come natural american abroad expect support government controversy foreign state time include naval bombardment locale deem violate right american occur sumatran town quallah battoo 1832 naval commander charles wilkes recognize importance national prosperity deem whale important merit federal support insofar benefit whale “ spread union ” follow “ recommend especial protection foster care government.”16,142,[1832],1832,1,1850,1850
179,"The systematic exploration and mapping of the still mostly uncharted waters of the Pacific Ocean are other ways in which the national government played a crucial role in fostering overseas commerce. Seemingly outside the limits of appropriate action by the national government, exploration and mapping actually should be viewed as the logical extension of the principle of commerce and exploration that motivated Jefferson to dispatch the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1804. The federal role in exploration and mapping the great white spaces on the map is mostly forgotten today. Yet, contrary to the myth of a minimalist national government in the decades before the Civil War, both the army and the navy endeavored to map and explore the unknown places of the earth, be they in the Pacific, the Amazon Basin, Paraguay, or western North America.","['1804', 'today', 'the decades']",systematic exploration mapping uncharted water pacific ocean way national government play crucial role foster overseas commerce seemingly outside limit appropriate action national government exploration mapping actually view logical extension principle commerce exploration motivate jefferson dispatch lewis clark expedition 1804 federal role exploration mapping great white space map forget today contrary myth minimalist national government decade civil war army navy endeavor map explore unknown place earth pacific amazon basin paraguay western north america,72,[1804],1804,1,1825,1850
180,"The United States Exploring Expedition of 1838–42, commonly known as the Wilkes Expedition, was the most significant exploration of the Pacific Ocean. The initial push for a federal role in the exploration of the Pacific was, as in the case of Lewis and Clark, in part scientific and in part economic. The scientific part concerned an effort to confirm or deny the so-called holes in the poles theory of John Cleve Symmes of New Jersey. In 1818, Symmes hypothesized the existence of giant holes at the northern and southern poles, providing entry into the interior of the earth. Crackpot as it sounds today, Symmes’s theory could not be rejected out of hand because of the minimal exploration to that time of the far southern and northern hemispheres. The economic push came from New England whaling interests, who wanted a systematic investigation of the Pacific to complement the informal voyages of exploration in search of the next big catch that marked the whaling industry. In 1828 the citizens of Nantucket petitioned Congress for an expedition to “explore and survey the islands and coasts of the Pacific seas” to better support the whaling industry and its investors.17","['1818', 'today', '1828']",united state explore expedition 1838–42 commonly know wilkes expedition significant exploration pacific ocean initial push federal role exploration pacific case lewis clark scientific economic scientific concern effort confirm deny call hole pole theory john cleve symme new jersey 1818 symme hypothesize existence giant hole northern southern pole provide entry interior earth crackpot sound today symm ’s theory reject hand minimal exploration time far southern northern hemisphere economic push come new england whaling interest want systematic investigation pacific complement informal voyage exploration search big catch mark whaling industry 1828 citizen nantucket petition congress expedition “ explore survey island coast pacific sea ” better support whaling industry investors.17,106,"[1818, 1828]",1823,2,1825,1850
181,"The U.S. Exploring Expedition proved to be one of the last and most successful of the Euro-American voyages of discovery, exploration, and mapping of the Pacific Ocean and Antarctica that occurred in the nineteenth century. Comprised of six ships and nearly 1,700 explorers, it also stands as one of the largest. Congressional penny-pinching and an inability to find competent leadership delayed its departure for ten years. Led by Charles Wilkes, a thirty-eight-year-old junior officer who lucked into the command owing to a lack of alternatives, the U.S. Ex Ex, as it became known, ran aground in controversy and was overshadowed by domestic politics when it returned home in 1842. Much of the controversy centered on the conduct of the irascible Wilkes, who commanded it with an iron hand, so much so as to engender near mutinies of his crew. Unlike the leaders of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, known for their wise and humane leadership, Wilkes was dictatorial and cruel, leaving his crew members perpetually on the verge of revolt. In place of the spirit of friendliness and cooperation with Native Americans characteristic of Lewis and Clark, the Wilkes Expedition engaged in numerous incidents of hostility and violence with local tribes and, in at least one case, a massacre.","['the nineteenth century', 'ten years', '1842']","u.s explore expedition prove successful euro voyage discovery exploration mapping pacific ocean antarctica occur nineteenth century comprise ship nearly 1,700 explorer stand large congressional penny pinching inability find competent leadership delay departure year lead charles wilkes thirty year old junior officer luck command owe lack alternative u.s ex ex know run aground controversy overshadow domestic politic return home 1842 controversy center conduct irascible wilke command iron hand engender near mutiny crew unlike leader lewis clark expedition know wise humane leadership wilkes dictatorial cruel leave crew member perpetually verge revolt place spirit friendliness cooperation native american characteristic lewis clark wilkes expedition engage numerous incident hostility violence local tribe case massacre",109,[1842],1842,1,1850,1850
182,"Although his instructions urged amicable ties with any peoples they met, Wilkes at times resorted to violence to punish and intimidate local residents. He also presumed to enforce American notions of justice wherever that appeared necessary. These two motives came together on the island of Fiji. Wilkes’s investigation of the murder of ten American merchant seaman in 1834 resulted in the arrest of a Fijian man named Vendovi, who was to be taken back to the United States to stand trial for his alleged crimes. As one of Wilkes’s officers later wrote, the Americans hoped to show the natives that “[t]o kill a white man was the very worst thing a Feegee man could do.”18 Imprisoned on board ship for two years, Vendovi died soon after the expedition’s return to New York. Wilkes also dispensed swifter and more violent forms of justice. Shortly after Vendovi’s arrest, a group of Fijians attacked a small party Wilkes had sent ashore to barter for food. The brief skirmish resulted in the deaths of two officers, one of whom was Wilkes’s nephew. In retaliation, Wilkes attacked the small island where the assault occurred, leveling its two main towns and killing an estimated eighty Fijians.","['1834', 'two years']",instruction urge amicable tie people meet wilke time resort violence punish intimidate local resident presume enforce notion justice appear necessary motif come island fiji wilkes ’s investigation murder merchant seaman 1834 result arrest fijian man name vendovi take united state stand trial allege crime wilkes ’s officer later write american hop native “ t]o kill white man bad thing feegee man do.”18 imprison board ship year vendovi die soon expedition ’s return new york wilkes dispense swift violent form justice shortly vendovi ’s arrest group fijian attack small party wilke send ashore barter food brief skirmish result death officer wilkes ’s nephew retaliation wilkes attack small island assault occur level main town kill estimate eighty fijian,116,[1834],1834,1,1850,1850
183,"The extent of Wilkes’s achievement, however, astounds even today. He charted the hazardous shoals at the mouth of the Columbia River and eight hundred miles of the Northwest Coast. He claimed to be the first to sight the Antarctic continent and surveyed and charted fifteen hundred miles of its coastline with remarkable accuracy, along a region that still bears his name – Wilkes Land. He drew more than 180 maps and charts of what was still a mostly uncharted Pacific Ocean. These charts became the foundation of American knowledge of the Pacific Ocean; his map of Tarawa Atoll guided the marines’ amphibious assault there in World War II. The precedent of oceanic exploration and investigation set by the Wilkes Expedition ultimately led to the creation of the U.S. Hydrographic Office in 1871. Wilkes and his crew brought back tens of thousands of specimens of flora and fauna that became the basis of the new Smithsonian Museum collection. Ironically Vendovi’s skull and later his death mask became a part of that collection.","['today', '1871']",extent wilkes ’s achievement astound today chart hazardous shoal mouth columbia river mile northwest coast claim sight antarctic continent survey chart mile coastline remarkable accuracy region bear – wilkes land draw 180 map chart uncharted pacific ocean chart foundation knowledge pacific ocean map tarawa atoll guide marines’ amphibious assault world war ii precedent oceanic exploration investigation set wilkes expedition ultimately lead creation u.s hydrographic office 1871 wilke crew bring ten thousand specimen flora fauna basis new smithsonian museum collection ironically vendovi ’s skull later death mask collection,87,[1871],1871,1,1875,1900
184,"American interest in China, though predating the War of Independence, escalated in 1784 when the merchant ship Empress of China, sailing out of Boston, returned home with goods worth at least twice the value of those it departed with. From that time on, accessing China’s wealth became the ultimate goal of American commerce; the tangible profits and seemingly limitless potential of the Chinese market fired the imaginations of well-connected individuals, including John Jacob Astor, Thomas H. Perkins, and John P. Cushing.

185,"The U.S. advance into the Asia-Pacific world comprised only part of a larger European invasion into the region, a process greatly facilitated by the very same revolutions in transportation, communication, and military might that had transformed the internal development of those states. Since the 1500s, Europeans had been trading by sea with China, but on humiliating terms. The protocols of Manchu China required visitors to perform nine prostrations before the imperial throne, a humiliating ritual known as the kowtow, as a precondition for communication of any kind. Cultural ethnocentrism does not entirely explain Chinese assumptions of Western barbarism. The Chinese (like the Hawaiians) directly experienced that barbarism in the form of the drunken, riotous activities of Western sailors on shore leave. Their frequent rampages left violence, destruction, and jurisdictional issues in their wake. A notable example occurred in the Terranova case of 1821. Francis Terranova, an American merchant sailor of Italian origin, was arrested by Chinese authorities and, based on dubious evidence, charged with the murder of a Chinese woman. Although in theory Western traders acknowledged the right of the Chinese to pursue lawbreakers on their soil, in practice, Chinese notions of justice, evidence, and culpability often clashed with Euro-American traditions. In Terranova’s case, the American merchant community, notwithstanding its concerns about his innocence, acquiesced in the man’s arrest. To the horror of this community, the Chinese tried Terranova in secret and executed him by strangulation. The case of Terranova and others like it made Westerners reluctant to allow their nationals to be prosecuted in Chinese courts.","['the 1500s', '1821']",u.s advance asia pacific world comprise large european invasion region process greatly facilitate revolution transportation communication military transform internal development state 1500s europeans trade sea china humiliating term protocol manchu china require visitor perform prostration imperial throne humiliating ritual know kowtow precondition communication kind cultural ethnocentrism entirely explain chinese assumption western barbarism chinese like hawaiian directly experience barbarism form drunken riotous activity western sailor shore leave frequent rampage leave violence destruction jurisdictional issue wake notable example occur terranova case 1821 francis terranova merchant sailor italian origin arrest chinese authority base dubious evidence charge murder chinese woman theory western trader acknowledge right chinese pursue lawbreaker soil practice chinese notion justice evidence culpability clash euro tradition terranova ’s case merchant community notwithstanding concern innocence acquiesce man ’s arrest horror community chinese try terranova secret execute strangulation case terranova like westerner reluctant allow national prosecute chinese court,144,[1821],1821,1,1825,1850
186,"Some Americans watched with great interest unfolding events in China. Although many condemned the attempt to force China to allow the importation of opium, others saw the matter in a broader context. To John Quincy Adams, the conflict was rooted in China’s refusal to trade on terms of equality: He wrote in 1842, “[T]he cause of the war is the kow-tow, the arrogant pretension of the Chinese to cultural superiority.” Adams saw commerce as “among the natural rights and duties of mankind,” obligatory to all peoples. Nations might define the terms of their trade, but they must engage with the markets of the world. The refusal to do so Adams deemed as “churlish” and deserving of harsh rebuke. For Americans the ideology of commerce functioned as an extension of the natural rights doctrine at the heart of their global revolution. Adams therefore welcomed the chastisement of what he saw as Chinese arrogance by British firepower during the Opium Wars.",['1842'],american watch great interest unfold event china condemn attempt force china allow importation opium see matter broad context john quincy adams conflict root china ’s refusal trade term equality write 1842 “ t]he because war kow tow arrogant pretension chinese cultural superiority ” adams see commerce “ natural right duty mankind ” obligatory people nation define term trade engage market world refusal adam deem “ churlish ” deserving harsh rebuke american ideology commerce function extension natural right doctrine heart global revolution adam welcome chastisement see chinese arrogance british firepower opium war,91,[1842],1842,1,1850,1850
187,"Americans did not stand idly by as these developments took place in China. A select group of merchants, missionaries, and whalers whose wealth and political connections made up in influence what it lacked in numbers had already been lobbying for action. In 1839, Dr. Peter Parker, a missionary and surgeon schooled at Yale, urged Secretary of State Webster to conceive of the United States as China’s “special friend” and protector from the rapacious practices of the other Western powers. The decisive opening of the China market in the early 1840s happened to occur at a moment when the White House was occupied by a president disposed to gain advantages from the situation. John Tyler, who earlier had worked to secure the Hawaiian Islands in the American orbit, now acted to secure American rights in the new trade regime in China. Tyler feared that if Americans did not gain formal access to the China trade they might find themselves excluded by European imperial powers, each of which now looked to expand its access to China. Accordingly, in the same message in which he affirmed a de facto protectorate over Hawaii, Tyler called for Congress to allocate funds to send a minister to China to represent American interests and possibly secure a formal commercial treaty, an emissary “ready … to address himself to the high functionaries of the Empire, or through them to the Emperor himself.”20","['1839', 'the early 1840s']",american stand idly development take place china select group merchant missionary whaler wealth political connection influence lack number lobby action 1839 dr peter parker missionary surgeon school yale urge secretary state webster conceive united state china ’s “ special friend ” protector rapacious practice western power decisive opening china market early 1840s happen occur moment white house occupy president dispose gain advantage situation john tyler earlier work secure hawaiian island orbit act secure right new trade regime china tyler fear american gain formal access china trade find exclude european imperial power look expand access china accordingly message affirm de facto protectorate hawaii tyler call congress allocate fund send minister china represent interest possibly secure formal commercial treaty emissary “ ready … address high functionary empire emperor himself.”20,127,"[1839, 1840]",1840,2,1850,1850
188,"After the much-admired Edward Everett turned the job down, Tyler turned to Caleb Cushing of Massachusetts. Cushing came from a prominent New England commercial family. His father, John P. Cushing, had been among the first Americans to get rich from the trade with China, and the elder Cushing impressed upon his son the utter necessity of expanding American trade relations throughout Asia. Caleb Cushing, recognized as one of the most well-read and erudite Americans of his era, eagerly embraced the mission as a means of enhancing his own stature and opening once and for all a potential market of 300 million people. After an initial period of awkward uncertainty as to whether he would be received by Chinese authorities, Cushing negotiated the landmark Treaty of Wanghia in 1844. Building on the British agreement, it secured five treaty ports for U.S. merchants, allowed the United States to set tariff rates for bilateral trade, and, most importantly, codified the principle of extraterritoriality for U.S. citizens in China. Americans, while they cultivated an image of themselves as China’s special friend, nonetheless took full advantage of what British firepower had gained in China.

189,"With the rising importance of the China trade and the rapid advance of Britain, France, and Russia in acquiring control of strategic Pacific Island groups, it is small wonder that, by the mid-1840s, opening Japan to the trade of the world became an important goal for some Americans. Characterized by Melville as the “double-bolted land,” Japan had been almost entirely closed to foreign vessels and traders since 1638, when the Tokugawa shogunate cut off contact with the outside world in the name of preventing invasion. Since that time only the Dutch had been allowed direct access to Japan, being limited to one ship per year landing at the port of Nagasaki. That one yearly contact had the purpose of allowing the Japanese to learn about the outside world via the medium of the Dutch. All others who dared land on Japanese shores, including shipwrecked sailors, faced torture, imprisonment, or death. The imprisonment and abuse of American shipwrecked sailors from the whaler Lagoda by Japanese authorities inflamed public opinion and proved to be important in building support for an expedition to compel Japan’s humane treatment of future castaways upon its shores.","['the mid-1840s', '1638']",rise importance china trade rapid advance britain france russia acquire control strategic pacific island group small wonder mid-1840s open japan trade world important goal american characterize melville “ double bolt land ” japan entirely closed foreign vessel trader 1638 tokugawa shogunate cut contact outside world prevent invasion time dutch allow direct access japan limit ship year land port nagasaki yearly contact purpose allow japanese learn outside world medium dutch dare land japanese shore include shipwreck sailor face torture imprisonment death imprisonment abuse shipwreck sailor whaler lagoda japanese authority inflame public opinion prove important building support expedition compel japan ’s humane treatment future castaway shore,104,"[1840, 1638]",1739,2,1750,1750

On his second mission, after having established relations with Thailand and what would become Vietnam, Roberts planned to journey to Japan and seek to open its trade to the world. But he contracted malaria and died before he could get there. In 1845, Commodore James Biddle sailed three American frigates into Edo (Tokyo) Bay, only to withdraw in the face of signs of imminent Japanese resistance. In 1847, the Japanese made a guest of Ranald Macdonald, an adventurer of highland Scot and Chinook Indian ancestry, who purposely beached his small boat on Japan’s shores.

191,"However, Commodore Matthew C. “Old Bruin” Perry is the true motive force behind both the expedition to open Japan and the strategic vision that informed it. Brother of Oliver Hazard Perry (a naval hero of the Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812), Old Bruin had served the nation for forty years when he began to push for a large naval expedition to open Japan to the world. Perry aimed to beat the other European imperial powers to the punch on what seemed to be the next target for expansion of Western influence. However, Perry also saw access to Japan as part of a larger geopolitical strategy designed favorably to position the United States in an emerging global marketplace increasingly driven by coal-powered ships. Wilkes’s explorations of the Northern Pacific had greatly enhanced the understanding of the geography of the region, and in 1847 Captain Matthew C. Maury (himself an explorer and surveyor of considerable achievement) sketched on a globe for Perry the Great Circle Route to Asia and the economies in distance it represented. This novel geographic insight offered the chance to cut in half the time required to voyage to Shanghai, potentially giving American commerce a tremendous advantage compared to their main rivals, the British. Running along the North Pacific from San Francisco to China, the Great Circle Route contained the island of Japan as a key stopping point, especially as a place to establish the coaling stations critical to the projection of naval power in the decades ahead.","['forty years', '1847', 'the decades ahead']",commodore matthew c. “ old bruin ” perry true motive force expedition open japan strategic vision inform brother oliver hazard perry naval hero battle lake erie war 1812 old bruin serve nation year begin push large naval expedition open japan world perry aim beat european imperial power punch target expansion western influence perry see access japan large geopolitical strategy design favorably position united state emerge global marketplace increasingly drive coal power ship wilkes ’s exploration northern pacific greatly enhance understanding geography region 1847 captain matthew c. maury explorer surveyor considerable achievement sketch globe perry great circle route asia economy distance represent novel geographic insight offer chance cut half time require voyage shanghai potentially give commerce tremendous advantage compare main rival british run north pacific san francisco china great circle route contain island japan key stopping point especially place establish coaling station critical projection naval power decade ahead,147,[1847],1847,1,1850,1850
192,"Perry’s impressive flotilla included four new steam-powered vessels nicknamed the Black Ships, whose belching smoke and tremendous firepower cowed the Japanese without firing a shot. Under the pretext of being required personally to deliver a letter to the Japanese emperor, on March 8, 1854, Perry landed the fleet at Yokohama with the actual mission of compelling Japan to open its doors to shipwrecked sailors and its markets to foreigners. Perry presented as gifts to his reluctant hosts an illustrated history of the Mexican War and scale models of a railroad and the telegraph, iconic technological symbols of the land he represented. After several weeks of intense negotiations, the Treaty of Kanagawa of March 31, 1854, designated Shimoda and Hakodadi as open ports where Americans could take on coal, water, and other provisions. The agreement also allowed Americans to trade with Japan on a most-favored-nation basis and obligated the Japanese to assist shipwrecked sailors. Four years later, in 1858, American merchant and diplomat Townsend Harris signed a pact opening four more ports for trade, formally establishing Japanese-American diplomatic ties, providing for a fixed tariff regime, and introducing the principle of extraterritoriality. European states soon followed the American lead, and Japan was irrevocably opened to the world.","['March 8, 1854', 'several weeks', 'Four years later', '1858']",perry ’s impressive flotilla include new steam power vessel nickname black ship belch smoke tremendous firepower cow japanese fire shot pretext require personally deliver letter japanese emperor march 8 1854 perry land fleet yokohama actual mission compelling japan open door shipwreck sailor market foreigner perry present gift reluctant host illustrate history mexican war scale model railroad telegraph iconic technological symbol land represent week intense negotiation treaty kanagawa march 31 1854 designate shimoda hakodadi open port american coal water provision agreement allow american trade japan favor nation basis obligate japanese assist shipwrecked sailor year later 1858 merchant diplomat townsend harris sign pact open port trade formally establish japanese diplomatic tie provide fixed tariff regime introduce principle extraterritoriality european state soon follow lead japan irrevocably open world,125,"[1854, 1858]",1856,2,1875,1900
193,"Perry’s historic mission to Japan met with little acclaim when he returned to the United States, overshadowed by the controversy engendered by the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the apathy of the Pierce administration, which proved to be unwilling to celebrate the achievement of a mission begun by the Whig president Millard Fillmore. Nevertheless, all of this American activity – commercial, extractive, exploratory, diplomatic, and naval – created a significant U.S. presence and interest in the Pacific. This interest then acted to influence the course of continental expansion by making the ports of California – San Francisco, San Diego, and Monterey – of much greater importance much sooner than they otherwise would have become. California, little known to most of the American public, by the mid-1840s had assumed a role of great strategic importance – more for its connections to and from Asia than as a destination for Americans traveling west. The discovery of gold in northern California in 1848 greatly accelerated the process of the creation of a trans-Pacific migratory and commercial community, but the vision of this possibility had predated the strike. From this perspective California, rather than the end point of the expansionist process, is better understood as a hinge on which a door swung that opened both westward toward Asia and the Pacific and eastward toward the rest of the country. By 1850, no nation in the world stood better positioned for future dominance than the United States.","['–', 'the mid-1840s', '1848', '1850']",perry ’s historic mission japan meet little acclaim return united state overshadow controversy engender kansas nebraska act apathy pierce administration prove unwilling celebrate achievement mission begin whig president millard fillmore activity – commercial extractive exploratory diplomatic naval – create significant u.s presence interest pacific interest act influence course continental expansion make port california – san francisco san diego monterey – great importance sooner california little known public mid-1840s assume role great strategic importance – connection asia destination american travel west discovery gold northern california 1848 greatly accelerate process creation trans pacific migratory commercial community vision possibility predate strike perspective california end point expansionist process better understand hinge door swing open westward asia pacific eastward rest country 1850 nation world stand better position future dominance united state,126,"[1840, 1848, 1850]",1846,3,1850,1850
194,"Even as Americans freed the seas and opened Japan to the world, they continued to expand the limits of their North American continental empire. From 1820 to 1860, Americans – diplomats and merchants, soldiers and missionaries, farmers and slave masters – pushed against the British presence in Canada and the Mexican presence in the Southwest to find out where their seemingly unstoppable expansionist momentum might be checked. At the same time, all across the imperial frontier the American Empire confronted the traditional obstacle of dozens of Native American tribes, who posed a major military, legal, and moral roadblock to expansionism. In essence, the imperial struggle to control North America that first had called forth the idea of the North American Union in the 1750s continued in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, except that France had dropped out of the imperial struggle and Spain had been replaced by the newly independent Republic of Mexico in 1821. The long line of expansionist thrusts whereby the United States had pushed halfway across North America had only created new contact points for expansionist pressures to create imperial controversies.","['From 1820 to 1860', 'the 1750s', 'the second quarter of the nineteenth century', '1821']",american free sea open japan world continue expand limit north continental empire 1820 1860 american – diplomat merchant soldier missionary farmer slave master – push british presence canada mexican presence southwest find seemingly unstoppable expansionist momentum check time imperial frontier empire confront traditional obstacle dozen native tribe pose major military legal moral roadblock expansionism essence imperial struggle control north america call forth idea north union 1750s continue second quarter nineteenth century france drop imperial struggle spain replace newly independent republic mexico 1821 long line expansionist thrust united state push halfway north america create new contact point expansionist pressure create imperial controversy,101,"[1750, 1821]",1786,2,1800,1800
195,"In spite of the expansionist success of the United States, many Americans retained a sense of being boxed in by other imperial powers. To the north, the British Empire loomed and the boundary with British-ruled Canada remained ill defined. Although the Convention of 1818 had established the forty-ninth parallel as the boundary across the great expanse from the Lake of the Woods to the Rockies, both the northwestern and the northeastern limits were ambiguous. Against this backdrop of diplomatic uncertainty, cross-border efforts to revolutionize Upper Canada threatened to bring the two states to blows. In 1837 a failed uprising against British rule in Canada just across the border from Buffalo, New York, spilled over into the United States when some Americans began to aid the rebellious Canadians. The old dream of the conquest of Canada refused to die; locals began to enlist in the rebel cause, provide the fighters with supplies, and even arm them with weapons from American arsenals, as the few federal officials on the scene watched helplessly. The sinking of the American steamer Caroline on the U.S. side of the Niagara River by British troops for allegedly resupplying the rebels so inflamed passions that a war did seem a distinct possibility, at least to those caught up in the excitement of the moment. The big picture, as seen by the administration of Martin Van Buren, was that however outrageous these events might seem, the overriding interest of both nations was for continued peace. Congress soon passed new neutrality statutes providing for stiff penalties for Americans who crossed into Canada intent on revolution. Nevertheless, Americans along the Canadian border from Vermont to Michigan began to organize Hunters’ Lodges, secret militias that aimed, as Thomas A. Bailey once described it, “to emancipate the British Colonies from British thralldom.”1 The Hunters’ Lodges numbered an estimated 15,000–20,000 members, who saw themselves acting in the spirit of 1776. In early 1838, Van Buren dispatched General Winfield Scott to the scene to use his powers of persuasion and impressive physical presence to tamp down the conflict.

197,"On the high seas, British and American interests collided in the controversy surrounding the handling of the American slave ship Creole. In November 1841, the 135 slaves on the ship being transported from Virginia to Louisiana mutinied and sought refuge in the British Bahamas. Once they arrived, British officials freed most of the slaves, much to the outrage of American owners of the human cargo; as they had after the British slave liberations of the War of Independence and War of 1812, the slave owners enlisted the central government in their efforts to be compensated for their loss. The Creole affair was only the latest in a long line of U.S. efforts to defend the institution of slavery just as it would any other material interest of its citizens. Although Congress had ended the international slave trade in 1807 and was nominally committed to cooperating with Great Britain in suppressing it, American political leaders would not allow British naval vessels the right to visit and search American ships for human contraband. It was too reminiscent of the British practices in searching for contraband of war. Throughout the antebellum, U.S. policy insisted that maintenance of the principle of freedom of the seas trumped efforts to suppress the slave trade.","['November 1841', '1807']",high sea british interest collide controversy surround handling slave ship creole november 1841 135 slave ship transport virginia louisiana mutiny seek refuge british bahamas arrive british official free slave outrage owner human cargo british slave liberation war independence war 1812 slave owner enlist central government effort compensate loss creole affair late long line u.s effort defend institution slavery material interest citizen congress end international slave trade 1807 nominally commit cooperate great britain suppress political leader allow british naval vessel right visit search ship human contraband reminiscent british practice search contraband war antebellum u.s policy insist maintenance principle freedom sea trump effort suppress slave trade,104,"[1841, 1807]",1824,2,1825,1850

Now, however, the nexus of trade and investment was too great to allow these distractions to determine the course of events. Fate also intervened to make Anglophilic John Tyler of Virginia president in 1841. Tyler’s anomalous ascent to power was made possible, first, by his changing of party affiliation in 1840 to run on the Whig ticket with William Henry Harrison (“Old Tippecanoe”) and then by Harrison’s death shortly after his inauguration in March 1841. A lifetime of exposure to deadly fire and to the elements did not prevent Harrison from contracting a severe cold on the day of his inauguration, from which he soon died. John Tyler then assumed the office of president, being the first man to accede to the presidency from the position of vice-president. Whigs viewed Tyler (derisively known as “His Accidency”) with suspicion, and his former fellow Democrats saw him as a turncoat. This distinct lack of political allies made Tyler a one-term president but did not stop him from realizing a substantial portion of his expansionist ambitions while in the Oval Office.","['1841', '1840', 'March 1841', 'the day']",irritant add crisis early period anglo relation nexus trade investment great allow distraction determine course event fate intervene anglophilic john tyler virginia president 1841 tyler ’s anomalous ascent power possible changing party affiliation 1840 run whig ticket william henry harrison “ old tippecanoe ” harrison ’s death shortly inauguration march 1841 lifetime exposure deadly fire element prevent harrison contract severe cold day inauguration soon die john tyler assume office president man accede presidency position vice president whig view tyler derisively know “ accidency ” suspicion fellow democrat see turncoat distinct lack political ally tyler term president stop realize substantial portion expansionist ambition oval office,104,"[1841, 1840, 1841]",1841,3,1850,1850
199,"Moreover, the British imperial project had at that time increasingly little stomach for contending over faraway holdings of marginal importance. The Maine–New Brunswick boundary dispute was rooted in uncertainty about the exact location of the geographic features referenced in the Peace Treaty of 1783, encompassing an area of about twelve thousand square miles. Webster and Ashburton divided the disputed area roughly 60/40 in favor of the United States. Ashburton also made concessions on three other minor ambiguities along the U.S.-Canadian border, including one near the Lake of the Woods in present-day Minnesota that gave the U.S. possession of what would become the Mesabi Range, for a time one of the richest sources of iron ore in the world. Ashburton’s conciliatory attitude on these minor boundary frictions reflected again his understanding that a few thousand acres of timberland counted for next to nothing as compared to the emerging Anglo-American axis of trade and finance. Of course, the central government had to sell to Maine and Massachusetts the idea of conceding even an acre of land; each had a stake in the outcome, and both had rejected earlier attempts at compromise on the issue. This time Webster won the states’ acquiescence with $150,000 in cash payments and some dubious arguments about the validity of their maximum claims. Although it left the Oregon question unaddressed, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 stands as another major landmark in the course of Anglo-American imperial cooperation.","['1783', 'present-day', '1842']","british imperial project time increasingly little stomach contend faraway holding marginal importance maine – new brunswick boundary dispute root uncertainty exact location geographic feature reference peace treaty 1783 encompass area thousand square mile webster ashburton divide disputed area roughly 60/40 favor united state ashburton concession minor ambiguity u.s .- canadian border include near lake wood present day minnesota give u.s possession mesabi range time rich source iron ore world ashburton ’s conciliatory attitude minor boundary friction reflect understanding thousand acre timberland count compare emerge anglo axis trade finance course central government sell maine massachusetts idea concede acre land stake outcome reject earlier attempt compromise issue time webster win states’ acquiescence 150,000 cash payment dubious argument validity maximum claim leave oregon question unaddress webster ashburton treaty 1842 stand major landmark course anglo imperial cooperation",133,"[1783, 1842]",1812,2,1825,1850
200,"In the Northwest, American imperial interest in the Oregon Country, a vast, ill-defined expanse bordering the Pacific Ocean between California and Alaska, collided once again with those of Great Britain and with the rights of the native peoples who lived there. On first glance, it might seem surprising that Americans took such an early and lively interest in an area so far from the center of the Union in 1830. That such a distant place assumed such importance so early speaks again to the remarkable expansionist energies of Americans. U.S. interest in the region dates to the voyages of Captain Robert Gray of Boston, who, at the helm of the Columbia, is credited with the discovery of the mouth of the river of the same name in 1792. Gray had been the first American to grasp the potential value of furs for the China market; soon a number of prominent entrepreneurs jumped at the opportunity, including John Jacob Astor and his American Fur Company; Astor established Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia in 1811 as a fur trading entrepôt. Here Astor’s enterprise collided with the Hudson’s Bay Company’s attempts to extract the wealth of the Northwest Coast; in 1813, men under Astor’s employ surrendered Astoria to British forces during the War of 1812. Astor’s influence with powerful people, particularly President James Monroe, contributed mightily to the staking of the first formal claim to Oregon via the transcontinental boundary drawn in the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819. Astor’s backstage lobbying resulted in Secretary of State Adams dispatching in September 1817 the USS Ontario, commanded by Captain James Biddle, to sail to the Northwest Coast and “to assert there the claims of sovereignty in the name … of the United States, by some symbolical or other appropriate mode of setting up a claim to national authority and dominion.”2 So the original American interest in the Oregon Country occurred from west to east, informed by Oregon’s potential role in trans-Pacific commerce.","['1830', '1792', '1811', '1813', '1819', 'September 1817']",northwest imperial interest oregon country vast ill define expanse border pacific ocean california alaska collide great britain right native people live glance surprising american take early lively interest area far center union 1830 distant place assume importance early speak remarkable expansionist energy american u.s interest region date voyage captain robert gray boston helm columbia credit discovery mouth river 1792 gray grasp potential value fur china market soon number prominent entrepreneur jump opportunity include john jacob astor fur company astor establish astoria mouth columbia 1811 fur trading entrepôt astor ’s enterprise collide hudson ’s bay company ’s attempt extract wealth northwest coast 1813 man astor ’s employ surrender astoria british force war 1812 astor ’s influence powerful people particularly president james monroe contribute mightily staking formal claim oregon transcontinental boundary draw adams onis treaty 1819 astor ’s backstage lobbying result secretary state adam dispatch september 1817 uss ontario command captain james biddle sail northwest coast “ assert claim sovereignty … united state symbolical appropriate mode set claim national authority dominion.”2 original interest oregon country occur west east inform oregon ’s potential role trans pacific commerce,184,"[1830, 1792, 1811, 1813, 1819, 1817]",1814,6,1825,1850
201,"and tells the tale of a deathly idyll in a mythic land drained by a mighty river named the Oregan [sic]. Official interest in settlement of the region began with the publication of a congressionally authorized report in 1821 by Virginia representative and later governor Dr. John Floyd. Floyd had an outsized interest in western expansion and, along with his Senate colleague Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri, decried what he saw as the capitulation of U.S. interests in Oregon to Great Britain via the “free and open occupation” clause of the Convention of 1818. Floyd’s report argued that “from the usage of all nations, previous and subsequent to the discovery of America, the title of the United States to a very large portion of the coast of the Pacific Ocean” was “well founded” and denied that “any other government than Spain has made any claim to any part of it, from Cape Horn to the sixtieth degree of North Latitude.”3 This disregarded the long-standing claims of both Britain and Russia to areas along the coast, not to mention the dozens of Indian tribes that inhabited these lands. Nonetheless, Floyd’s report concludes that there can be no doubt “that an establishment made on the Pacific … would give this country the advantage of all its own treasures, which otherwise must be lost forever, … of more profit … than the mines of Potosi,” a reference to the fabled source of silver in Mexico. At Benton’s urging, the report not only stakes a claim to the Oregon Country but also goes on to blame John Quincy Adams for giving up the American claim to Texas extending to the Rio Grande, the origins of later calls for the “reannexation” of that province. But Floyd’s chief concern was Oregon, and he introduced legislation to allow Americans to build settlements along the Columbia River and the U.S. government to establish a customs house, regulate trade with Indian tribes in the area, and license fur traders.

202,"Benton’s interest in an overland route focused on its potential as a sort of American Silk Road, an avenue of commerce more than settlement. He hoped that the rich products of the Northwest might be a good medium of exchange with the Chinese and thus reduce the drain of silver to the East. The desire to prevent the outflow of silver by finding a substitute for it in the China trade had informed the Monroe administration’s interest in the Northwest; Benton now urged policymakers to follow up on that start and definitively assert U.S. hegemony in the region. Like Jefferson, Benton at times suggested that the nation he foresaw arising on the western slope of the continent might be a sister republic to the United States. Such comments were merely speculative and never had the slightest chance of becoming real.

203,"A distinct American interest in approaching Oregon from the sea complemented Benton’s overland boosterism. American whalers and sea otter hunters working the offshore waters had stimulated the Monroe administration’s strong response to the tsar’s ukase reserving the Northwest Coast from the Bering Strait to 51 degrees north latitude solely for Russian subjects and banning the approach of foreign vessels to within one hundred miles of the shore. The claim represented a dramatic expansion of Russian influence aimed at preventing the “Bostonese” from encroaching northward in pursuit of whales and sea otters. Resistance to this move by Adams and Monroe resulted in the ukase being withdrawn, the first example of the successful application of the Monroe Doctrine’s noncolonization clause. American activities in the offshore regions of the Northwest Coast had been secured. So an American interest in the Northwest Coast was formed, based in part on the lobbying of particular economic interests, in part on the assertion that Britain’s and Russia’s activities constituted an unacceptable challenge to the Monroe Doctrine’s principle of noncolonization, and in part on Oregon’s emerging role as the next great land of opportunity for the westward-looking American. In 1823 Adams, in instructions he drafted to Minister Henry Middleton in Russia, described the American claim to Oregon (at least to the forty-ninth parallel) as “unquestionable,” making its acquisition a mere matter of time.","['1823', 'forty-ninth']",distinct interest approach oregon sea complement benton ’s overland boosterism whaler sea otter hunter work offshore water stimulate monroe administration ’s strong response tsar ’s ukase reserve northwest coast ber strait 51 degree north latitude solely russian subject ban approach foreign vessel mile shore claim represent dramatic expansion russian influence aim prevent “ bostonese ” encroach northward pursuit whale sea otter resistance adam monroe result ukase withdraw example successful application monroe doctrine ’s noncolonization clause activity offshore region northwest coast secure interest northwest coast form base lobbying particular economic interest assertion britain ’s russia ’s activity constitute unacceptable challenge monroe doctrine ’s principle noncolonization oregon ’s emerge role great land opportunity westward look 1823 adam instruction draft minister henry middleton russia describe claim oregon ninth parallel “ unquestionable ” make acquisition mere matter time,134,[1823],1823,1,1825,1850
204,"The Free and Open Occupation Treaty of 1818 (also known as the Convention of 1818) with Great Britain succeeded in putting off for ten years a decision about the Oregon Country. Yet the tide was ebbing for the British. In 1825, the Hudson’s Bay Company pulled back to north of the Columbia River, essentially conceding the American claim to lands south of the river. North of there, the situation remained contentious. American claims to lands extending as far north as 54 degrees, 40 minutes collided with the British interests, whose rising economic importance had caught London’s attention. As a result, Anglo-American negotiators chose to renew the Free and Open Occupation Treaty indefinitely, each nation needing to give one year’s notice of an intention to withdraw from its strictures.","['1818', 'ten years', '1825', 'one year’s']",free open occupation treaty 1818 know convention 1818 great britain succeed put year decision oregon country tide ebb british 1825 hudson ’s bay company pull north columbia river essentially concede claim land south river north situation remain contentious claim land extend far north 54 degree 40 minute collide british interest rise economic importance catch london ’s attention result anglo negotiator choose renew free open occupation treaty indefinitely nation need year ’s notice intention withdraw stricture,75,"[1818, 1825]",1822,2,1825,1850
205,"By the mid-1830s, evangelical aspirations also drove the rising interest in the Oregon Country. Reports of a group of Nez Perce Indians arriving in St. Louis searching for a black book they had heard would give them great power electrified the evangelical community. They took the journey of the Indians as a sure sign of the hungering for Christianity of the heathen tribes of the far west and soon began organizing missionary bands to settle in Oregon. By 1835 Jason Lee had established a Methodist mission in the Willamette Valley, and by 1837 Marcus Whitman and his wife, Narcissa, had planted a Presbyterian outpost at Wailapu, near present-day Walla Walla, Washington. Anglican and Catholic missions also were established to civilize the Indians, who in most cases showed little interest in conversion or civilization at least as defined by white people. Nevertheless, the missionary thrust into Oregon, like those before them into China and Hawaii, reinvigorated the evangelical movement domestically, suggesting that American-style Christianity, like the society as a whole, needed to expand in order to survive.","['the mid-1830s', '1835', '1837', 'present-day']",mid-1830 evangelical aspiration drive rise interest oregon country report group nez perce indian arrive st louis search black book hear great power electrify evangelical community take journey indians sure sign hungering christianity heathen tribe far west soon begin organize missionary band settle oregon 1835 jason lee establish methodist mission willamette valley 1837 marcus whitman wife narcissa plant presbyterian outpost wailapu near present day walla walla washington anglican catholic mission establish civilize indians case show little interest conversion civilization define white people missionary thrust oregon like china hawaii reinvigorate evangelical movement domestically suggest style christianity like society need expand order survive,100,"[1830, 1835, 1837]",1834,3,1850,1850
206,"The Panic of 1837 and the subsequent hard times also served to increase the attractiveness of Oregon as a new land of opportunity. However, it was the endeavors of John C. Fremont of the U.S. Army Topographical Corps that unleashed what became known as “Oregon fever.” Fremont’s career epitomizes the possibilities inherent in nineteenth-century America. Born out of wedlock, the son of a French expatriate and the runaway wife of a much older man, Fremont exuded energy and ambition that caught the eye of Senator Benton and that of his talented and eligible daughter Jessie, whom in due course Fremont married.","['1837', 'nineteenth-century']",panic 1837 subsequent hard time serve increase attractiveness oregon new land opportunity endeavor john c. fremont u.s army topographical corp unleash know “ oregon fever ” fremont ’s career epitomize possibility inherent nineteenth century america bear wedlock son french expatriate runaway wife old man fremont exude energy ambition catch eye senator benton talented eligible daughter jessie course fremont married,59,[1837],1837,1,1850,1850
207,"Benton used his senatorial prerogatives to finance a topographical corps exploration of an overland route west with his son-in-law in command. With Benton as the visionary and Fremont as the “Pathfinder of Empire” (as the Democratic Review described him), the road west was surveyed and mapped. Fremont’s first expedition in 1842 surveyed the route west from St. Louis to South Pass in the Rockies, by far the easiest path through the mountains. Going somewhat beyond his orders, Fremont took it upon himself to climb Mt. Snow (later renamed for him) in Wyoming’s Wind River Range, where he dramatically planted an American flag on what he claimed (incorrectly) to be the highest peak in the Rockies. With the help of Jessie (a talented writer), Fremont, upon returning to Washington, published a report to Congress of his explorations. The narrative featured him in the role of dashing action hero and had an inestimable impact in fueling interest in the road west. These tales of a way west as blazed by the intrepid Fremont electrified the nation, stimulating the first great migration to Oregon in 1843, when a thousand Americans went to see for themselves the beautiful and fertile lands along the Willamette River. Soon, thousands more followed the Oregon Trail, carving wagon wheel ruts into the mountains and prairies that, in some places, are still visible today. These developments made the momentum toward annexation seem unstoppable. In June 1845, the United States Magazine and Democratic Review editorialized that “the tide of American emigration has lately set” in the direction of Oregon, “and nothing but a fatal misstep on our part, can prevent its habitable portions being occupied in a few years by our countrymen, and a vast trade thence carried on over all the Pacific.”5","['1842', '1843', 'today', 'June 1845', 'a few years']",benton senatorial prerogative finance topographical corps exploration overland route west son law command benton visionary fremont “ pathfinder empire ” democratic review describe road west survey map fremont ’s expedition 1842 survey route west st louis south pass rockie far easy path mountain go somewhat order fremont take climb mt snow later rename wyom ’s wind river range dramatically plant flag claim incorrectly high peak rockie help jessie talented writer fremont return washington publish report congress exploration narrative feature role dash action hero inestimable impact fuel interest road west tale way west blaze intrepid fremont electrify nation stimulate great migration oregon 1843 thousand american go beautiful fertile land willamette river soon thousand follow oregon trail carve wagon wheel rut mountain prairie place visible today development momentum annexation unstoppable june 1845 united state magazine democratic review editorialize “ tide emigration lately set ” direction oregon “ fatal misstep prevent habitable portion occupy year countryman vast trade carry pacific.”5,157,"[1842, 1843, 1845]",1843,3,1850,1850
208,"By the mid-1840s Oregon fever occupied a prominent place in the national imagination. An immense province inhabited by a handful of Americans suddenly became essential to the nation’s future prosperity. Oregon seemed destined to be a part of the United States if only from the inevitable rapid population growth that would stem from the small colony of immigrants. British foreign secretary Lord Castlereagh had predicted to Americans as early as 1818 that “you will conquer Oregon in your bedchambers,” and by the 1840s some members of Congress sought to bring that to pass. Rep. Andrew Kennedy of Indiana asked, “Where shall we find room for all of our people, unless we have Oregon? What shall we do with all those little white-headed boys and girls – God bless them! – that cover the Mississippi valley, as the flowers cover the western prairies?” Kennedy, in the tradition of Franklin, characterized the great fecundity of the American settlers as “the American multiplication table.”6However much Americans may have desired Oregon, though, their claim to it was tenuous at best. John Quincy Adams addressed the legal shortcomings of the American position by affirming to Congress that the foundation of the claim rested on the biblical injunction to “be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it.” To Adams, this was “the foundation not only to our title to Oregon but the foundation of all human title to all human possessions.”7","['the mid-1840s', 'as early as 1818', 'the 1840s']",mid-1840s oregon fever occupy prominent place national imagination immense province inhabit handful american suddenly essential nation ’s future prosperity oregon destine united state inevitable rapid population growth stem small colony immigrant british foreign secretary lord castlereagh predict american early 1818 “ conquer oregon bedchamber ” 1840s member congress seek bring pass rep andrew kennedy indiana ask shall find room people oregon shall little white head boy girl – god bless – cover mississippi valley flower cover western prairie ” kennedy tradition franklin characterize great fecundity settler “ multiplication table.”6however american desire oregon claim tenuous best john quincy adams address legal shortcoming position affirm congress foundation claim rest biblical injunction “ fruitful multiply replenish earth subdue ” adams “ foundation title oregon foundation human title human possessions.”7,126,"[1840, 1818, 1840]",1833,3,1850,1850
209,"John Tyler was nearly as staunch an advocate for Oregon as he was for Texas. In his special message to Congress marking the beginning of his presidency, he alluded to “the immense region” between the Rockies and the mouth of the Columbia, “about 770,000,000 acres, ceded and unceded, [that] still remain to be brought into market.” Although the twenty million or so Americans at that time hardly seemed to require this distant land, Tyler sought to augment their numbers by extending “to the people of other countries an invitation to come and settle among us as members of our rapidly growing family…. No motive exists for foreign conquest; we desire but to reclaim our almost illimitable wildernesses and to introduce into their depths the lights of civilization.”8 Although Tyler seemed to hold out the promise of Oregon’s being rapidly populated by people from around the world, in the early 1840s he did not want large numbers of American emigrants to enter the region for fear that it might complicate a diplomatic solution with Great Britain. Yet Benton and other staunch western expansionists pushed the expansionist tide, presenting Britain with a fait accompli of conquest by immigration that ultimately proved crucial in wresting the province from them. The rapid increase in the number of settlers in the region proved decisive in staking the claim of the American Empire.",['the early 1840s'],"john tyler nearly staunch advocate oregon texas special message congress mark beginning presidency allude “ immense region ” rockie mouth columbia “ 770,000,000 acre cede unceded remain bring market ” million american time hardly require distant land tyler seek augment number extend “ people country invitation come settle member rapidly grow family … motive exist foreign conquest desire reclaim illimitable wilderness introduce depth light civilization.”8 tyler hold promise oregon ’s rapidly populate people world early 1840s want large number emigrant enter region fear complicate diplomatic solution great britain benton staunch western expansionist push expansionist tide present britain fait accompli conquest immigration ultimately prove crucial wrest province rapid increase number settler region prove decisive stake claim empire",116,[1840],1840,1,1850,1850
210,"California represented another emerging expansionist vista for Americans. A keen taste for the needs of future millions motivated its acquisition, for, as with Oregon, Americans surely did not need its abundant resources in the 1840s. However, many recognized that California at some point would be a land of great opportunity and needed to be seized at the first chance that presented itself. California had come late under the white man’s imperial gaze. Spanish imperial claims to the region dated to the voyages of Juan de Cabrillo in the 1630s, but for 150 years no effort was made to secure control of the area north of San Diego Bay, the unofficial beginning of what was called Alta California. Fearing the encroachment of Russia down the coast, in 1769 Jesuit missionaries began construction of twenty-one missions (or presidios) from San Diego to Sonoma, each a day apart and designed both to Christianize the numerous Indian tribes along the route and, if necessary, to enlist their services as soldiers in defending California. As it happened, the few regular Spanish troops in the province spent most of their energies pursuing Indians fleeing the forced labor regime and infectious diseases of the missions. The Indians of California did not respond well to their encounter with civilization; disease, overwork, and cultural dislocation reduced their numbers from an estimated 300,000 in 1769 to about half that by the 1840s.","['the 1840s', 'the 1630s', '150 years', '1769', 'each a day', '1769 to about half', 'the 1840s']","california represent emerge expansionist vista american keen taste need future million motivate acquisition oregon americans surely need abundant resource 1840s recognize california point land great opportunity need seize chance present california come late white man ’s imperial gaze spanish imperial claim region date voyage juan de cabrillo 1630s 150 year effort secure control area north san diego bay unofficial beginning call alta california fear encroachment russia coast 1769 jesuit missionary begin construction mission presidio san diego sonoma day apart design christianize numerous indian tribe route necessary enlist service soldier defend california happen regular spanish troop province spend energy pursue indians flee force labor regime infectious disease mission indian california respond encounter civilization disease overwork cultural dislocation reduce number estimate 300,000 1769 half 1840s",123,"[1840, 1630, 1769, 1769, 1840]",1770,5,1775,1800
211,"Mexico’s independence from Spain in 1821 resulted in California’s increasing autonomy, and for a few years a small population of Californios lived a life of prosperity and relative ease, sustained by the oceanic tallow and hide trade derived from the large herds of cattle that grazed California’s verdant fields. In the 1820s and 1830s, a few Americans established themselves as merchants and traders, most notably Thomas Larkin of Monterey. Mexican president Lopez de Santa Ana’s attempt in 1835 to increase central control of California proved no more popular there than it had in Texas, but because Mexico City lacked the resources to make good on its new claim to authority, no revolt occurred as in Texas. California’s irresistible allure captured the imagination of even Andrew Jackson, whom John Quincy Adams characterized as “wild” for the region.","['1821', 'a few years', 'the 1820s and 1830s', '1835']",mexico ’s independence spain 1821 result california ’s increase autonomy year small population californio live life prosperity relative ease sustain oceanic tallow hide trade derive large herd cattle graze california ’s verdant field 1820 1830s american establish merchant trader notably thomas larkin monterey mexican president lopez de santa ana ’s attempt 1835 increase central control california prove popular texas mexico city lack resource good new claim authority revolt occur texas california ’s irresistible allure capture imagination andrew jackson john quincy adams characterize “ wild ” region,86,"[1821, 1835]",1828,2,1850,1850
212,"By the mid-1840s and notwithstanding the distinctly dubious claims held to both places, California, like Oregon, seemed destined under the will of Heaven to become a part of the United States. To realize its vast potential required American energies. As an author in Democratic Review put it in the summer of 1845, “California will, probably, next fall … The Anglo-Saxon foot is already on its borders. Already the advance guard of the irresistible army of the Anglo-Saxon emigration has begun to pour down upon it, armed with the plough and the rifle, and marking its trail with schools and colleges, courts and representative halls, mills and meeting-houses.”9 It is a candid and mostly accurate characterization of the nature of the American expansionist process. The American imperial juggernaut seemed poised to assume control of the entire continent. But how, exactly, would the transfer occur? In 1842, responding to false reports of a war breaking out with Mexico, American naval commander Thomas Ap Catesby Jones sailed his squadron into the central California port of Monterey and claimed the province for the United States. Jones just as hurriedly returned control to local authorities when he discovered that war had not broken out. Nevertheless, a point had been made: California could be conquered with a minimum of effort.","['the mid-1840s', 'the summer of 1845', 'next fall', '1842']",mid-1840s notwithstanding distinctly dubious claim hold place california like oregon destine heaven united state realize vast potential require energy author democratic review summer 1845 “ california probably fall … anglo saxon foot border advance guard irresistible army anglo saxon emigration begin pour arm plough rifle mark trail school college court representative hall mill meeting houses.”9 candid accurate characterization nature expansionist process imperial juggernaut poise assume control entire continent exactly transfer occur 1842 respond false report war break mexico naval commander thomas ap catesby jones sail squadron central california port monterey claim province united state jone hurriedly return control local authority discover war break point california conquer minimum effort,108,"[1840, 1845, 1842]",1842,3,1850,1850
213,"Fremont, so essential to bringing Oregon into the American sphere, also played a key role in facilitating the conquest of California. In 1846, on his fourth expedition to the West – ostensibly to explore and survey routes into California – Fremont met with and subtly encouraged (but at first refused openly to support) the growing American settler community in California, most of whom eagerly sought annexation to the United States. Upon receiving what he later characterized as implicit orders from President Polk to foment a revolution, Fremont freed his small force of soldiers to participate in the local uprising known as the Bear Flag Revolt, so-called because the image of a lone star and grizzly bear under the words “California Republic” became the standard of the rebels. Fremont’s actions, while extraconstitutional to say the least, were in the tradition of Andrew Jackson, whose unhesitating takedown, without orders, of East Florida in 1818 remained an important precedent that Polk now relied upon. Fremont, conscious of the humiliation endured by Thomas Ap Catesby Jones for acting too precipitously and unaware of events along the Nueces River that would formally mark the beginning of the U.S.-Mexico War, only slowly recognized that the moment of annexation was at hand. Finally, Fremont joined with naval forces under Commodore Robert F. Stockton to create a U.S. military presence on land and sea, and after minimal fighting conquered both northern and southern California by January 1847.","['1846', '1818', 'January 1847']",fremont essential bring oregon sphere play key role facilitate conquest california 1846 fourth expedition west – ostensibly explore survey route california – fremont meet subtly encourage refuse openly support grow settler community california eagerly seek annexation united state receive later characterize implicit order president polk foment revolution fremont free small force soldier participate local uprising know bear flag revolt call image lone star grizzly bear word “ california republic ” standard rebel fremont ’s action extraconstitutional tradition andrew jackson unhesitating takedown order east florida 1818 remain important precedent polk rely fremont conscious humiliation endure thomas ap catesby jones act precipitously unaware event nuece river formally mark beginning u.s .- mexico war slowly recognize moment annexation hand finally fremont join naval force commodore robert f. stockton create u.s military presence land sea minimal fighting conquer northern southern california january 1847,139,"[1846, 1818, 1847]",1837,3,1850,1850
214,"Between 1820 and 1860, the United States pushed against the imperial limits that circumscribed it. In a great arc from the Maine boundary question, to the Oregon dispute, to the growing desire for California, the Americans defined and extended their claims with surprising ease. Yet Texas – the last section of the arc – proved quite difficult to secure. A major part of the extensive borderlands between the United States and Hispanic America, Texas constituted a thinly populated area of indeterminate boundaries with tenuous ties to the capital in faraway Mexico City. U.S. claims to Texas were rooted in dubious assumptions about the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase. It had been a part of the demands made on Spain during the protracted negotiations finally leading to the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819. At that time, the claim to Texas seemed highly abstract, for relatively few Americans had even visited the province. At a crucial moment in the negotiations with Spain, Adams and Monroe decided to sacrifice the claim to Texas in exchange for the establishment of a transcontinental boundary dividing the United States from Mexico. James Monroe’s concerns about the role of Texas as a possible new land for slavery explains this diplomatic sleight of hand that, in the celebratory mood that greeted the treaty, went mostly unnoticed at the time by the political classes. The western boundary of the Louisiana Purchase was set at the Sabine River, and the province of Texas gained independence in 1821 as the northernmost state of the Republic of Mexico.","['Between 1820 and 1860', '1819', '1821']",1820 1860 united state push imperial limit circumscribe great arc maine boundary question oregon dispute grow desire california american define extend claim surprising ease texas – section arc – prove difficult secure major extensive borderland united state hispanic america texas constitute thinly populated area indeterminate boundary tenuous tie capital faraway mexico city u.s claim texas root dubious assumption boundary louisiana purchase demand spain protracted negotiation finally lead adams onis treaty 1819 time claim texas highly abstract relatively american visit province crucial moment negotiation spain adams monroe decide sacrifice claim texas exchange establishment transcontinental boundary divide united state mexico james monroe ’s concern role texas possible new land slavery explain diplomatic sleight hand celebratory mood greet treaty go unnoticed time political class western boundary louisiana purchase set sabine river province texas gain independence 1821 northernmost state republic mexico,137,"[1819, 1821]",1820,2,1825,1850
215,"Although diplomats drew a border that presumed to divide the United States and Mexico, ambitious Americans eager for the next big opportunity eyed Texas hungrily. The trickle of Americans crossing the Sabine and seeking wealth in Texas increased to a steady stream in 1823, when the central government in Mexico, eager to populate Texas as a means to better exert sovereignty over its vast extent, began to encourage Americans to emigrate there. Moses Austin, a newspaperman from Connecticut, led the first contingent of three hundred or so families to the new promised land of Texas; upon his death, his son Stephen F. Austin, whose economic hopes like those of his father had been dashed in the Panic of 1819, occupied the first land grant in 1823. The Mexican colonization scheme was generous: It offered parcels of 4,428 acres for a mere $200 that included with them the title of empresario. This made Texas land vastly more affordable than land in the United States, precipitating a flood of Anglo settlers – mostly young men on the make – into Texas in the 1820s and early 1830s.","['1823', '1819', '1823', 'the 1820s and early 1830s']","diplomat draw border presume divide united state mexico ambitious american eager big opportunity eyed texas hungrily trickle american cross sabine seek wealth texas increase steady stream 1823 central government mexico eager populate texas means better exert sovereignty vast extent begin encourage american emigrate moses austin newspaperman connecticut lead contingent family new promise land texas death son stephen f. austin economic hope like father dash panic 1819 occupy land grant 1823 mexican colonization scheme generous offer parcel 4,428 acre mere 200 include title empresario texas land vastly affordable land united state precipitate flood anglo settler – young man – texas 1820 early 1830s",102,"[1823, 1819, 1823]",1822,3,1825,1850

Anderson observes, “The vast majority of Anglos who came to Texas were capable with a rifle,” often the Kentucky long rifle, which offered a significant advantage when matched against any other weapon currently in the province.10 After about 1840, the introduction of the Colt six-shooter – the first revolver – augmented this firepower advantage.

217,"The first wave of settlers who arrived with Stephen Austin for the most part sought to become loyal Mexican subjects and deal with the Tejanos on conditions of equality, but, by the latter part of the 1820s, those who crossed the Sabine increasingly had in mind thoughts of future annexation by the United States. The first move toward independence had been the short-lived Fredonia Revolt of 1825, but the real impetus to rebellion occurred because of the limits on slavery imposed by the Mexican legislature beginning in 1828. This formed only one part of an attempt by the government in Mexico City and its new leader, Lopez de Santa Ana, to recentralize power under quasi-dictatorial rule. The formerly loose tie to Mexico City steadily tightened on a people unused to being closely governed. From that point on it would only be a matter of time before a revolt occurred.","['the 1820s', '1825', '1828']",wave settler arrive stephen austin seek loyal mexican subject deal tejano condition equality 1820 cross sabine increasingly mind thought future annexation united state independence short live fredonia revolt 1825 real impetus rebellion occur limit slavery impose mexican legislature begin 1828 form attempt government mexico city new leader lopez de santa ana recentralize power quasi dictatorial rule loose tie mexico city steadily tighten people unused closely govern point matter time revolt occur,71,"[1820, 1825, 1828]",1824,3,1825,1850
218,"The Texas Declaration of Independence, signed on March 2, 1836, by fifty-nine revolutionaries, most of them Anglos, justified the revolt by the alleged failure of the Mexican government to protect the lives and property of its citizens and for instigating Indian attacks on Texas settlements. It made no direct reference to the restrictions on slavery. The ragtag resistance, including some members of the Tejano community, seemed no match for Santa Ana’s 5,000-strong expeditionary force sent to quash the revolt, and catastrophic losses at the Alamo and Goliad added to the sense of impending doom in the spring of 1836. Anglo settlers fearing retribution for treason fled by the thousands back across the Sabine River into Louisiana. Santa Ana’s troops pursued one last remnant of the Texas revolutionary army to what looked like a final massacre of the sort that occurred at the Alamo and Goliad, in the latter case of several hundred Texian troops who had surrendered. But in near-miraculous fashion the Texians, led by War of 1812 veteran and Jackson protégé Sam Houston, destroyed the enemy force in a devastating surprise counterattack along the San Jacinto River in April 1836. After a short battle, the Texians took bloody revenge for their fallen comrades at the Alamo and Goliad, slaughtering hundreds of unresisting Mexican soldiers. The defeat of the Mexican expeditionary force meant the effective end of the war. With independence secured, the Texas Congress voted unanimously to petition for annexation to the United States. It seemed a prime candidate for admission into the Union. As an independent nation, Texas had adopted as its state flag a lone star against a red background, a design nearly identical to that adopted by the rebels in West Florida in their brief existence as an independent republic before Madison annexed the province in 1810, thereby securing the lands immediately to the east of Louisiana. Now the region immediately to the west of that state had been revolutionized in much the same manner and appeared ripe for absorption into the Union.","['March 2, 1836', 'the spring of 1836', 'April 1836', '1810']","texas declaration independence sign march 2 1836 revolutionary anglos justify revolt alleged failure mexican government protect life property citizen instigate indian attack texas settlement direct reference restriction slavery ragtag resistance include member tejano community match santa ana ’s 5,000-strong expeditionary force send quash revolt catastrophic loss alamo goliad add sense impending doom spring 1836 anglo settler fear retribution treason flee thousand sabine river louisiana santa ana ’s troop pursue remnant texas revolutionary army look like final massacre sort occur alamo goliad case texian troop surrender near miraculous fashion texian lead war 1812 veteran jackson protégé sam houston destroy enemy force devastating surprise counterattack san jacinto river april 1836 short battle texian take bloody revenge fall comrade alamo goliad slaughter hundred unresisting mexican soldier defeat mexican expeditionary force mean effective end war independence secure texas congress vote unanimously petition annexation united state prime candidate admission union independent nation texas adopt state flag lone star red background design nearly identical adopt rebel west florida brief existence independent republic madison annex province 1810 secure land immediately east louisiana region immediately west state revolutionize manner appear ripe absorption union",185,"[1836, 1836, 1836, 1810]",1830,4,1850,1850
219,"But fierce opposition greeted the prospect of Texas annexation. A broad cross section of Northerners, Whig party members, and abolitionists reacted with horror at the idea of another slave state being added to a republic founded on the idea of liberty. For as the cotton empire built on unfree labor grew immensely in the 1820s and 1830s, so did a rising opposition to slavery in both the United States and Britain. The abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1833 had upped the stakes for many Americans, including John Quincy Adams, now a member of the House of Representatives from Massachusetts. Adams had long been one of the nation’s most zealous expansionists and as president had made some minor efforts to purchase Texas from Mexico. He now represented only the people of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and the personal objections he had long held regarding slavery could openly be expressed. The writings of Quaker abolitionist Benjamin Lundy acted to spur Adams’s conscience. Lundy, whose magnetic influence also drew William Lloyd Garrison to the abolitionist cause, had sought to establish a free-labor colony in Texas to demonstrate that economic success in the province did not necessarily depend on a slave labor regime. However, the dislocations caused by the Texas Revolution stymied his efforts. Lundy wrote of his struggles in “The Origins and True Causes of the Texas Revolution,” detailing what he saw as a slaveholder plot to bring Texas into the Union as a first step toward the establishment of a slave labor–based Southern Confederacy. If the South did not remain in the Union, Northerners would face the prospect of inhabiting a country that both sanctioned and spread the institution of slavery. Adams now perceived the Union to be fracturing along free state–slave state lines and that at some point one side or the other would become dominant. If Texas entered with slaves, Cuba might soon follow; a worst-case scenario offered the prospect of an abolitionist Britain waging war to abolish the institution throughout the Western Hemisphere. Adams declared before the House that “it is my solemn belief that the annexation of an independent foreign power to this government would be ipso facto a dissolution of this Union” and that the United States would be “damned to ‘everlasting fame’ by the reinstitution of that detested system of slavery” after it had been abolished while Texas was a part of Mexico.11","['the 1820s and 1830s', '1833']",fierce opposition greet prospect texas annexation broad cross section northerner whig party member abolitionist react horror idea slave state add republic found idea liberty cotton empire build unfree labor grow immensely 1820 1830s rise opposition slavery united state britain abolition slavery british empire 1833 up stake american include john quincy adams member house representative massachusetts adam long nation ’s zealous expansionist president minor effort purchase texas mexico represent people plymouth massachusetts personal objection long hold slavery openly express writing quaker abolitionist benjamin lundy act spur adam ’s conscience lundy magnetic influence draw william lloyd garrison abolitionist because seek establish free labor colony texas demonstrate economic success province necessarily depend slave labor regime dislocation cause texas revolution stymie effort lundy write struggle “ origin true cause texas revolution ” detail see slaveholder plot bring texas union step establishment slave labor – base southern confederacy south remain union northerner face prospect inhabit country sanction spread institution slavery adam perceive union fracture free state – slave state line point dominant texas enter slave cuba soon follow bad case scenario offer prospect abolitionist britain wag war abolish institution western hemisphere adam declare house “ solemn belief annexation independent foreign power government ipso facto dissolution union ” united state “ damned ‘ everlasting fame’ reinstitution detest system slavery ” abolish texas mexico.11,217,[1833],1833,1,1850,1850
220,"If the prospect of annexing Texas made the rising antislavery faction nearly apoplectic, the prospect of not annexing it disturbed proslavery Southerners even more. The refusal to absorb a population overwhelmingly Southern in its makeup and culture was insulting, but an even greater concern was what might happen to Texas outside the bonds of the Union. In particular, Southerners worried that Great Britain might see the reluctance of the United States to annex Texas as an invitation to bring it under its control by guaranteeing its independence and paying its debts in exchange for abolishing slavery. This scenario – not at all far-fetched – threatened the slave interest with the nightmare of seeing slavery’s westward expansion blocked by Great Britain and the very existence of the “peculiar institution” challenged by an increasingly emboldened Northern antislavery sentiment. In 1843 Texas president Sam Houston, incensed that annexation had been blocked, subtly made known Texas’s receptiveness to British offers of support if no better option presented itself. Playing the British card had prompted Tyler to act in the case of Hawaii, and it might work in the case of Texas.

221,"Texas, meanwhile, left at the altar of annexation in 1837, pursued its own expansionist foreign policy as an independent republic while beating back Mexican efforts to subdue it and Comanche efforts to harass it. Driven by land speculation, in the late 1830s the Texans, under new president Mirabeau Lamar, waged unrelenting war on the Indian tribes of north central Texas, especially the Comanches, whose empire had bestrode the Great Plains for two centuries. A ferocious war of massacre and mutilation ensued against them in an attempt to eradicate what some whites termed “the wild cannibals of the woods.”14 This effort at the ethnic cleansing of Texas had as one of its aims bringing the United States into the conflict, which ranged back and forth across the ill-defined Texas-U.S. border. The presence of Indians recently removed to the vicinity from the east – Shawnees, Cherokees, and others – confused the already tense geopolitical situation in the region. President Lamar, lacking the sympathy for Native Americans that Houston retained from his close association with the Cherokees, pushed a campaign to conquer New Mexico and establish a claim all the way to the Pacific Ocean. The absurdity of this massive expansionist pretension by the relative handful of Anglos (fewer than forty thousand) who inhabited Texas at the time did not lessen its significance, for when the United States did go to war with Mexico over Texas its negotiating position was built on the claims established by Lamar and other expansionists.","['1837', 'the late 1830s', 'two centuries']",texas leave altar annexation 1837 pursue expansionist foreign policy independent republic beat mexican effort subdue comanche effort harass drive land speculation late 1830s texan new president mirabeau lamar wag unrelenting war indian tribe north central texas especially comanche empire bestrode great plain century ferocious war massacre mutilation ensue attempt eradicate white term “ wild cannibal woods.”14 effort ethnic cleansing texas aim bring united state conflict range forth ill define texas u.s border presence indians recently remove vicinity east – shawnee cherokee – confuse tense geopolitical situation region president lamar lack sympathy native american houston retain close association cherokee push campaign conquer new mexico establish claim way pacific ocean absurdity massive expansionist pretension relative handful anglo few thousand inhabit texas time lessen significance united state war mexico texas negotiating position build claim establish lamar expansionist,134,"[1837, 1830]",1834,2,1850,1850

Northerners in Congress, led by John Quincy Adams, proposed amending the Constitution to end the three-fifths clause (which inflated Southern political power in the House of Representatives), a move not calculated to ease Southern fears of becoming a permanent political minority. The fears of slaveholders mounted as they confronted what they saw as a rising abolitionist tide, both in the North and in Great Britain. On the annexation of Texas hung the question of whether slavery would live or die in North America, and yet there appeared no way a two-thirds majority in the Senate could be roused in support of it. In 1843, Mexico began negotiating with the Houston government the terms of permanent independence for Texas if it cooperated with Great Britain in emancipating its slaves.

223,"Upshur first convinced President Houston to agree to a new annexation treaty by convincing him that it could reach the supermajority needed for ratification, enlisting former president Jackson, in one of his last acts, to write a letter to his old protégé Houston to that effect. Houston acquiesced to the pressure and speedily drafted a new treaty by April 1844. Prior to that, fate had stepped in by a bizarre and unexpected means. While a member of an official party witnessing the test-firing of a huge new gun – nicknamed “the Peacemaker” – on the USS Princeton in February 1844, Upshur and several others died when the weapon exploded on deck. The driving force behind a new annexation treaty was dead, but the momentum Upshur created for it lived on. New secretary of state John C. Calhoun, previously urged by Upshur to push for Texas, now embraced the expansionist cause with great fervor. So did Andrew Jackson, who in the waning days of his life took it upon himself to lobby against his former protégé Martin Van Buren as the Democratic nominee for president in 1844 owing to Van Buren’s insufficient ardor for Texas. Mississippi senator Robert Walker produced tracts issuing dire warnings of slavery’s imminent demise if Texas were not annexed, thereby denying slaveholders a place to “diffuse” their rising slave populations westward and “eventually get rid of an intolerable burden.”16 Slavery, like commerce, evangelical Christianity, and the Union itself, needed to expand in order to survive.","['April 1844', 'February 1844', 'the waning days', '1844']",upshur convinced president houston agree new annexation treaty convince reach supermajority need ratification enlist president jackson act write letter old protégé houston effect houston acquiesce pressure speedily draft new treaty april 1844 prior fate step bizarre unexpected mean member official party witness test firing huge new gun – nickname “ peacemaker ” – uss princeton february 1844 upshur die weapon explode deck drive force new annexation treaty dead momentum upshur create live new secretary state john c. calhoun previously urge upshur push texas embrace expansionist because great fervor andrew jackson wan day life take lobby protégé martin van buren democratic nominee president 1844 owe van buren ’s insufficient ardor texas mississippi senator robert walker produce tract issue dire warning slavery ’s imminent demise texas annex deny slaveholder place “ diffuse ” rise slave population westward “ eventually rid intolerable burden.”16 slavery like commerce evangelical christianity union need expand order survive,150,"[1844, 1844, 1844]",1844,3,1850,1850
224,"Polk still faced an uphill battle against the Whigs, whose nominee, Henry Clay, had long opposed Texas annexation, as apparently did a majority of the country. But in two public letters on the question in April and July 1844, Clay waffled on his antislavery, anti-annexation stands in an effort to woo voters from the South. The strategy backfired, gaining Clay virtually no new supporters in the southern states and seriously compromising his support with Northern antislavery Whigs. His flirtation with proslavery annexationists prompted the tiny Liberty party to nominate an uncompromising antislavery candidate in the person of James K. Birney. Clay’s waffling killed his chances for victory. Losing every state in the South, Clay likely would still have prevailed in the Electoral College had not Birney’s candidacy cost him precious votes in New York and Michigan. In the face of a divided majority electorate, Polk won the presidency by a 170–105 electoral margin. Polk’s narrow victory by no means constituted a mandate for dramatic action, and yet lame duck president Tyler seized upon it in January 1845 to reintroduce the Texas question, this time in the form of admission as a new state. Annexation by a joint resolution of each congressional body required only a simple majority – an evasion of the troublesome two-thirds majority needed to ratify a treaty. A week before Polk’s inauguration, the Senate voted 27–25 to admit Texas, following the lead of the House, which had given it a 120–98 victory. As Polk took the oath of office, Tyler sent a courier to Texas with the offer of statehood. On July 4, 1845, Texas representatives voted unanimously to accept the offer.

225,"James Knox Polk of Tennessee, like Tyler, was an unlikely occupant of the White House in an age of so many ambitious and accomplished individuals. Born in North Carolina, the descendant of Irish immigrants, he graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1816 with honors in mathematics and the classics at a time when few Americans had college degrees. A stint as a lawyer in the office of prominent Tennessee politician Felix Grundy positioned Polk to become a protégé of Andrew Jackson’s and a staunch proponent of the Jacksonian program of expansionism and union. In 1825 Polk began a long career in the House as one of its youngest members, eventually becoming Speaker in 1835. Yet he never evinced a strong ambition to be president, never advanced himself as a candidate, and would never have been the Democratic nominee except for the rising expansionist tide within the party that denied the renomination of Martin Van Buren in 1844. Polk emerged as the first dark horse candidate in American presidential history, little known to many members of his own party. As had virtually every president before him, Polk in his inaugural address invoked “the aid of that Almighty Ruler of the Universe in whose hands are the destinies of nations.” Frankly acknowledging his own youth (at forty-nine he was the youngest American president yet elected), he pledged his best efforts in administering an office critical to the nation’s success “and in some degree the hopes and happiness of the whole human family.”18","['1816', '1825', '1835', '1844']",james knox polk tennessee like tyler unlikely occupant white house age ambitious accomplish individual bear north carolina descendant irish immigrant graduate university north carolina 1816 honor mathematic classic time american college degree stint lawyer office prominent tennessee politician felix grundy position polk protégé andrew jackson ’s staunch proponent jacksonian program expansionism union 1825 polk begin long career house young member eventually speaker 1835 evince strong ambition president advance candidate democratic nominee rise expansionist tide party deny renomination martin van buren 1844 polk emerge dark horse candidate presidential history little known member party virtually president polk inaugural address invoke “ aid almighty ruler universe hand destiny nation ” frankly acknowledge youth young president elect pledge good effort administer office critical nation ’s success “ degree hope happiness human family.”18,128,"[1816, 1825, 1835, 1844]",1830,4,1850,1850
226,"With nearly equal fervor, Polk asserted American claims to Oregon. In his inaugural address, he quoted John Quincy Adams’s instructions in 1823 to Henry Middleton asserting U.S. claims to the region as “‘clear and unquestionable.’” Polk placed this claim in a larger context in his first annual message to Congress in December 1845. Proceeding from the position that “Oregon is a part of the North American continent, to which, it is confidently affirmed, the title of the United States is now the best in existence,” the president called for Congress to increase the pressure on Great Britain by formally giving the year’s notice required to end the Free and Open Occupation Treaty of 1828. He also urged the establishment of a line of forts between the Missouri River and the Rockies and insisted that “an adequate force of mounted riflemen be raised to guard and protect” American settlers heading west. Once again, the long arm of the central government reached out to defend the lives and interests of American settlers. Most importantly, Polk called for the United States to resist the encroachment of European imperial ambition in North America: “We must ever maintain the principle that the people of this continent alone have the right to decide their own destiny.” In fact, Polk explicitly referenced Monroe’s noncolonization principle articulated in his famous message of 1823 as the basis of his policy. Monroe’s vision of a hemisphere free of further European meddling had indeed become sound doctrine in the hands of Polk, if modified to include only North America: “[I]t should be distinctly announced to the world as our settled policy that no future European colony or dominion” should be attempted “on any part of the North American continent.”","['1823', 'annual', 'December 1845', 'year', '1828', '1823']",nearly equal fervor polk assert claim oregon inaugural address quote john quincy adams ’s instruction 1823 henry middleton assert u.s claim region “ ‘ clear unquestionable.’ polk place claim large context annual message congress december 1845 proceed position “ oregon north continent confidently affirm title united state good existence ” president call congress increase pressure great britain formally give year ’s notice require end free open occupation treaty 1828 urge establishment line fort missouri river rockie insist “ adequate force mount rifleman raise guard protect ” settler head west long arm central government reach defend life interest settler importantly polk call united state resist encroachment european imperial ambition north america “ maintain principle people continent right decide destiny ” fact polk explicitly reference monroe ’s noncolonization principle articulate famous message 1823 basis policy monroe ’s vision hemisphere free european meddling sound doctrine hand polk modify include north america “ i]t distinctly announce world settle policy future european colony dominion ” attempt “ north continent,164,"[1823, 1845, 1828, 1823]",1830,4,1850,1850
227,"Although somewhat overlooked by historians, Polk’s first annual message remains one of the most significant such presidential addresses ever delivered, in part owing to the fact of Polk’s subsequent determination to make good on its promises. Also significant is how much of it builds on the principles and perceived shortcomings of the Monroe administration, as the memory of that era continued to inform the expansionist politics of the 1840s. For if Monroe and Adams’s statecraft merited praise for its affirmation of hemispheric superiority, it also deserved rebuke for “unwisely” ceding claims to Texas and Oregon.21","['annual', 'the 1840s']",somewhat overlook historian polk ’s annual message remain significant presidential address deliver owe fact polk ’s subsequent determination good promise significant build principle perceive shortcoming monroe administration memory era continue inform expansionist politic 1840s monroe adams ’s statecraft merit praise affirmation hemispheric superiority deserve rebuke “ unwisely ” cede claim texas oregon.21,52,[1840],1840,1,1850,1850
228," Polk first focused on acquiring Oregon, threatening the British with war if an agreement satisfactory to U.S. aspirations could not be worked out. Polk proceeded from the assumption that while the American legal position vis-à-vis Oregon might not be ironclad it still constituted the “best” claim, disregarding of course the claims of the Indian tribes to the region. This echoed a theme proving popular in the press, the notion that notwithstanding the claims and counterclaims of the various interested parties, “the true title” to Oregon belonged to Americans, ultimately coming from God in the name of progress. This attitude, a founding assumption of Manifest Destiny, guided Polk’s Oregon diplomacy from the start. It received widest circulation via an editorial under the heading “The True Title” appearing in the New York Morning News on December 27, 1845:","['December 27, 1845']",polk focus acquire oregon threaten british war agreement satisfactory u.s aspiration work polk proceed assumption legal position vis à vis oregon ironclad constitute “ good ” claim disregard course claim indian tribe region echo theme prove popular press notion notwithstanding claim counterclaim interested party “ true title ” oregon belong american ultimately come god progress attitude found assumption manifest destiny guide polk ’s oregon diplomacy start receive wide circulation editorial head “ true title ” appear new york morning news december 27 1845,83,[1845],1845,1,1850,1850
229,"Once fastened on to a goal, President James Polk was single-minded in its pursuit. He did not allow political opponents or constitutional objections to interfere with achieving his aims. His at times high-handed methods provoked controversy. To his critics, among them Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia, he was “Polk the mendacious,” a president having an unparalleled capacity for “duplicity and equivocation.”1 There is evidence to support such a view, as Polk’s intense sense of purpose at times prompted him to ride roughshod over the facts of a particular case. Yet he might equally be known as “Polk the audacious” for his outsized imperial ambitions as well as his get-it-done leadership style. Photographs of the Tennessean taken late in his life (photography being another one of the miraculous new technologies of the 1840s) reveal a visage that is as much a map to Polk’s roughhewn character as are the more famous images of Abraham Lincoln made some years later.","['the 1840s', 'some years later']",fasten goal president james polk single minded pursuit allow political opponent constitutional objection interfere achieve aim time high handed method provoke controversy critic alexander h. stephen georgia “ polk mendacious ” president have unparalleled capacity “ duplicity equivocation.”1 evidence support view polk ’s intense sense purpose time prompt ride roughshod fact particular case equally know “ polk audacious ” outsized imperial ambition leadership style photograph tennessean take late life photography miraculous new technology 1840s reveal visage map polk ’s roughhewn character famous image abraham lincoln year later,87,[1840],1840,1,1850,1850
230,"Polk did not dally in pushing his ambitious agenda. At the outset of his administration he negotiated aggressively with Great Britain, ever ready to “twist the lion’s tail” if necessary to let British foreign secretary Lord Aberdeen know that popular hostility toward Great Britain could be whipped up as necessary to support the administration’s hard line. Britain sought to set the northern boundary at the Columbia River and to guarantee British vessels the right of passage along that stream. Given that few Americans lived north of the Columbia River at that time, it seemed a reasonable proposal. However, Polk wanted access to the harbor at Puget Sound, so he artfully used the rambunctiousness of the “54–40 or Fight” faction in the Democratic party to maneuver for his true goal: the establishment of the northern boundary at 49 degrees. He fomented Democrats from the Northwest such as Edward Hannegan of Indiana and William Allen of Ohio to demand all of Oregon, assuring them that he would never back down from the claim to 54–40 even though he planned all along to use their extreme claims to form the basis of a compromise at 49 degrees. He pushed Congress to vote to give the required year’s notice of the intention to end the joint occupancy agreement in Oregon, apparently a step in the direction of confrontation. Here the president benefited from the demonstrated willingness of Americans to fight even when a lack of preparedness and plain common sense seemed to preclude that option, and indeed, the chest-thumping assertions of Hannegan, Allen, and others bore some resemblance to the War Hawks of 1812. Polk, unlike Madison, was not controlled by hotheads in Congress but rather used their threats to help extract a deal. He insisted that British settlements north of the forty-ninth parallel constituted a dangerous and unacceptable breech of the Monroe Doctrine’s noncolonization clause forbidding further European settlement in the hemisphere, and in the early months of 1846 he threatened a third Anglo-American war over a territory peripheral to the immediate interests of both nations.","['year', 'forty-ninth', 'the early months of 1846']",polk dally push ambitious agenda outset administration negotiate aggressively great britain ready “ twist lion ’s tail ” necessary let british foreign secretary lord aberdeen know popular hostility great britain whip necessary support administration ’s hard line britain seek set northern boundary columbia river guarantee british vessel right passage stream give american live north columbia river time reasonable proposal polk want access harbor puget sound artfully rambunctiousness “ 54–40 fight ” faction democratic party maneuver true goal establishment northern boundary 49 degree foment democrat northwest edward hannegan indiana william allen ohio demand oregon assure claim 54–40 plan use extreme claim form basis compromise 49 degree push congress vote required year ’s notice intention end joint occupancy agreement oregon apparently step direction confrontation president benefit demonstrate willingness american fight lack preparedness plain common sense preclude option chest thump assertion hannegan allen bear resemblance war hawk 1812 polk unlike madison control hothead congress threat help extract deal insist british settlement north ninth parallel constitute dangerous unacceptable breech monroe doctrine ’s noncolonization clause forbid european settlement hemisphere early month 1846 threaten anglo war territory peripheral immediate interest nation,185,[1846],1846,1,1850,1850
231,"If Polk bluffed war and sought peace with Great Britain, it was very much the reverse as concerns the Republic of Mexico. From the time of Texas independence in 1836, successive governments in Mexico City had threatened war if the United States annexed Texas. This had not really delayed annexation – internal political divisions over slavery were largely responsible for that – but it had contributed to anxiety over the admission of Texas to the Union. Yet when Texas did enter the Union in July 1845, Mexican officials took no meaningful action other than to break off diplomatic relations. To Polk, this signified weakness and an invitation to increase the pressure, to provoke a confrontation forcing Mexico to defend its national honor and from which the United States could then attain its expansionist goals. First, he had to appear to try to resolve the differences with Mexico via negotiation. To that end, he dispatched John Slidell of Louisiana to Mexico City to negotiate the range of issues separating the two states. In truth, Slidell went not to negotiate but to dictate: He demanded that Mexico drop its protests against the annexation of Texas, recognize its boundary at the Rio Grande del Norte, and agree to sell California ($25 million) and New Mexico ($3 million) to the United States. In exchange for these extravagant demands, the Polk administration stood ready to assume the nearly $2 million in claims that American citizens held against the Mexican government for private property seized during the course of the numerous revolutions since 1821 (once again, the central government acted the part of the bill collector of last resort for American entrepreneurs abroad).","['1836', 'that –', 'July 1845', '1821']",polk bluff war seek peace great britain reverse concern republic mexico time texas independence 1836 successive government mexico city threaten war united state annex texas delay annexation – internal political division slavery largely responsible – contribute anxiety admission texas union texas enter union july 1845 mexican official take meaningful action break diplomatic relation polk signify weakness invitation increase pressure provoke confrontation force mexico defend national honor united state attain expansionist goal appear try resolve difference mexico negotiation end dispatch john slidell louisiana mexico city negotiate range issue separate state truth slidell go negotiate dictate demand mexico drop protest annexation texas recognize boundary rio grande del norte agree sell california 25 million new mexico 3 million united state exchange extravagant demand polk administration stand ready assume nearly 2 million claim citizen hold mexican government private property seize course numerous revolution 1821 central government act bill collector resort entrepreneur abroad,148,"[1836, 1845, 1821]",1834,3,1850,1850
232,"Polk had little confidence that Slidell would succeed in his mission; as it turned out, the chaotic political situation in Mexico City prevented Slidell’s formal reception by the Mexican government. Slidell’s rebuff probably did not matter. No regime could negotiate away territory to the Yankees and survive. Late in 1845 General Mariano Paredes y Arrilaga took power in a bloodless coup, making the army the de facto sovereign of the putative republic. Slidell remained unacknowledged, finally leaving Mexico City in March 1846 convinced that only force could bring Mexico to its senses. Although Polk hoped that annexation might be achieved peacefully, his reading of the Mexican political scene made him judge it as unlikely that an agreement of the sort he wanted could be obtained. The intransigence and chaos of the Mexican authorities played right into Polk’s hands, for it opened the door to the war of conquest that he wanted. What national pride and political circumstance made impossible, the objective balance of forces between the two states made inevitable.

233,"Polk had been expecting and planning for a war (or possibly two) from the day of his inauguration as president. In July 1845, before annexation had even been finalized, he ordered General Zachary B. Taylor to advance a force of 4,000 troops to the south bank of the Nueces River. After Texas formally entered the Union in December, Polk ordered Taylor to take up a position in the north bank of the Rio Grande and launch a blockade – an act of war – against Matamoros at the mouth of the Nueces River. Equally important, Polk ordered the creation of a customs house, an unmistakable sign of national authority. The move to defend the Rio Grande is significant because it was evidence that the United States had annexed not only Texas but also Texas’s imperial claims and now stood ready to assert them as its own. Just across the river, nearly 5,000 Mexican troops confronted the American presence.","['the day', 'July 1845', 'December', '–']","polk expect plan war possibly day inauguration president july 1845 annexation finalize order general zachary b. taylor advance force 4,000 troop south bank nuece river texas formally enter union december polk order taylor position north bank rio grande launch blockade – act war – matamoros mouth nuece river equally important polk order creation custom house unmistakable sign national authority defend rio grande significant evidence united state annex texas texas ’s imperial claim stand ready assert river nearly 5,000 mexican troop confront presence",82,[1845],1845,1,1850,1850
234,"In March 1846, Polk repeated his request to Congress for an increase in the size and preparedness of the army and navy, citing the “unusual and extraordinary armaments and warlike preparations, naval and military” by Great Britain in the vicinity of the Northwest Coast.2 Yet, by that time, the talks with Great Britain verged on success; Polk wanted increased armaments to confront Mexico, not Great Britain. While the public fretted about the possibility of another war with Great Britain, Polk waited for circumstances to evolve with Mexico. Once an agreement with Britain on Oregon had been secured, and following the arrival of the news that Mexican officials had rebuffed Slidell, Polk acted. On Saturday, May 9, he convened his cabinet for a council of war. His diary entry on the meeting reveals that the members agreed that circumstances – on claims, Texas, and the insulting treatment of Slidell – justified an immediate declaration of war, all except for Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft, who argued that the United States should wait for Mexico to take some aggressive action so that it could plausibly be blamed for starting the conflict. The president adjourned the meeting, having resolved to ask for war the following Tuesday. Yet, only hours later, news arrived that on April 24 a company of American dragoons patrolling the east bank of the Rio Grande had been attacked by a much larger Mexican force, killing sixteen U.S. troops and taking the rest prisoner. Polk now had his indisputable casus belli. He moved up his war message to Congress to Monday, May 11.","['March 1846', 'Saturday', 'May 9', 'Tuesday', 'April 24', 'Monday', 'May 11']",march 1846 polk repeat request congress increase size preparedness army navy cite “ unusual extraordinary armament warlike preparation naval military ” great britain vicinity northwest coast.2 time talk great britain verge success polk want increase armament confront mexico great britain public fret possibility war great britain polk wait circumstance evolve mexico agreement britain oregon secure follow arrival news mexican official rebuff slidell polk act saturday 9 convene cabinet council war diary entry meeting reveal member agree circumstance – claim texas insulting treatment slidell – justify immediate declaration war secretary navy george bancroft argue united state wait mexico aggressive action plausibly blame start conflict president adjourn meeting have resolve ask war follow tuesday hour later news arrive april 24 company dragoon patrol east bank rio grande attack large mexican force kill sixteen u.s troop take rest prisoner polk indisputable casus belli move war message congress monday 11,146,[1846],1846,1,1850,1850
235,"Blood. Soil. Patriotism. Honor. Rights. Duty. Polk held a strong hand as he attempted to coax Congress into war notwithstanding widespread opposition to it. To ensure that the administration got the vote tally it wanted, Polk’s congressional allies strictly limited debate on the measure, arguing that General Taylor’s exposed position in Mexico allowed no time for discussion. The vote occurred after only two hours of debate in the Senate and only a little more than that in the House. Members of Congress had no time to examine the mass of documents submitted by the president in support of his case – documents that in any event had only a tangential relation to the arguments made by the president. Calhoun later claimed that had members been given a chance to scrutinize these documents, no more then ten would have voted yes. Yet Calhoun seems to have forgotten the circumstances surrounding the First Seminole War, when the Monroe administration had submitted a mass of documents that allegedly supported its case and that a later congressional investigative committee found to be largely irrelevant. As was the case in 1819, the rhetoric of American empire combined with the reality of American war dead overwhelmed facts at odds with the official narrative. In the end, Polk got his war, easily, as the House voted 179–14 in favor, and the Senate 40–2. Thirty-five members of the House abstained from voting, skeptical of Polk’s rationale for war but too afraid to vote against the measure for fear of being labeled unpatriotic. Daniel Webster missed the vote. Polk called for “a large body of volunteers” to fly to arms to chastise the Mexicans and for all the resources needed to “prosecute the war with vigor.”4",['1819'],blood soil patriotism honor right duty polk hold strong hand attempt coax congress war notwithstanding widespread opposition ensure administration get vote tally want polk ’s congressional ally strictly limited debate measure argue general taylor ’s exposed position mexico allow time discussion vote occur hour debate senate little house member congress time examine mass document submit president support case – document event tangential relation argument president calhoun later claim member give chance scrutinize document vote yes calhoun forget circumstance surround seminole war monroe administration submit mass document allegedly support case later congressional investigative committee find largely irrelevant case 1819 rhetoric empire combine reality war dead overwhelmed fact odd official narrative end polk get war easily house vote 179–14 favor senate 40–2 thirty member house abstain vote skeptical polk ’s rationale war afraid vote measure fear label unpatriotic daniel webster miss vote polk call large body volunteer ” fly arm chastise mexican resource need “ prosecute war vigor.”4,156,[1819],1819,1,1825,1850
236,"One of the strongest challenges to Polk’s claims regarding the origins of the war came from first-term representative Abraham Lincoln of Illinois. Within weeks of taking his seat in 1847, Lincoln introduced a series of eight resolutions designed to interrogate the administration’s claim that Mexico had started the war and more specifically to determine the exact “spot” on which it allegedly had “shed American blood upon the American soil.” Lincoln feared that Polk, by manipulating the public to support his expansionist agenda, had opened the door to some future president using a similar ruse to unleash from congressional control the executive power to make war. Lincoln followed up his “spot resolutions” against the war by endorsing Rep. George Ashmun’s January 1848 amendment asserting that the conflict had been “unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President.” Finally, the first-term lawmaker made an hour-long speech to the House decrying the president’s duplicity, characterizing his defense of the war as “the half-insane mumbling of a fever dream,” and the president as “a bewildered, confounded, and miserably perplexed man.” Yet while some observers cheered Lincoln’s principled stand, others did not, including many in his home district. Newspaper editorialists contrasted Lincoln’s “pathetic lamentations over the fate of those Mexicans” to his supposed “cold indifference in regard to our own slaughtered citizens.” The Chicago Times alleged that Lincoln “made himself ridiculous and odious … in giving aid and comfort to the Mexican enemy.”7 Ultimately, Lincoln learned from his one-man crusade against “Mr. Polk’s War” that, once begun, a war could take on a life of its own and that the public had little interest in revisiting the details of how it began. Lincoln paid for his principled opposition to the war by being voted out of office in 1848.","['weeks', '1847', 'January 1848', '1848']",strong challenge polk ’s claim origin war come term representative abraham lincoln illinois week take seat 1847 lincoln introduce series resolution design interrogate administration ’s claim mexico start war specifically determine exact “ spot ” allegedly “ shed blood soil lincoln fear polk manipulate public support expansionist agenda open door future president similar ruse unleash congressional control executive power war lincoln follow “ spot resolution ” war endorse rep george ashmun ’s january 1848 amendment assert conflict “ unnecessarily unconstitutionally begin president ” finally term lawmaker hour long speech house decry president ’s duplicity characterize defense war “ half insane mumbling fever dream ” president “ bewildered confound miserably perplexed man ” observer cheer lincoln ’s principled stand include home district newspaper editorialist contrast lincoln ’s “ pathetic lamentation fate mexican ” suppose “ cold indifference regard slaughter citizen ” chicago time allege lincoln “ ridiculous odious … give aid comfort mexican enemy.”7 ultimately lincoln learn man crusade “ mr polk ’s war ” begin war life public little interest revisit detail begin lincoln pay principled opposition war vote office 1848,181,"[1847, 1848, 1848]",1848,3,1850,1850
237,"To Polk, the fiction of Mexican aggression had to be staunchly maintained so as to justify a cession of territory as punishment. He spent the rest of the war affirming the thesis of Mexican aggression as the cause of the conflict. At times, his efforts to do so backfired. He nearly caused a revolt in the Senate by affixing a preamble to that effect to the actual congressional declaration of war. Some senators could not stomach signing off on what appeared to them to be an egregious falsehood. Polk well understood that the war needed to be seen as legitimate in its causes if he hoped to gain what he wanted as one of its consequences. Asserting Texas’s claim to the Rio Grande del Norte is not as far-fetched as some historians have suggested. True, the Spanish imperial authorities in 1816 formally had defined the Texas boundary to be the Nueces; this was the claim now asserted by Mexico. But a Texas claim to the Rio Grande had first been staked via the terms of Santa Ana’s surrender at San Jacinto in 1836; the fact that Santa Ana later renounced the agreement and that the Mexican legislature never ratified it meant not a whit to Texans – they had a signed treaty in hand and intended to assert its legitimacy by force, as did Polk. The claim to the Rio Grande del Norte was dubious at best, but no more so than other American expansionist claims, including that to Oregon. Wherever the first blood had been spilled, the matter proved moot once Congress validated Polk’s narrative of events by voting for war. Once war had begun, no politically acceptable way existed to stop it without seeming to diminish support for the troops in the field. As a result, Congress regularly voted monies for a war that many members opposed.","['1816', '1836']",polk fiction mexican aggression staunchly maintain justify cession territory punishment spend rest war affirm thesis mexican aggression because conflict time effort backfire nearly cause revolt senate affix preamble effect actual congressional declaration war senator stomach sign appear egregious falsehood polk understand war need see legitimate cause hop gain want consequence assert texas ’s claim rio grande del norte far fetch historian suggest true spanish imperial authority 1816 formally define texas boundary nuece claim assert mexico texas claim rio grande stake term santa ana ’s surrender san jacinto 1836 fact santa ana later renounce agreement mexican legislature ratify mean whit texan – sign treaty hand intend assert legitimacy force polk claim rio grande del norte dubious good expansionist claim include oregon blood spill matter prove moot congress validate polk ’s narrative event vote war war begin politically acceptable way exist stop diminish support troop field result congress regularly vote monie war member oppose,152,"[1816, 1836]",1826,2,1850,1850
238,"Even as war with Mexico loomed, the diplomatic dance with Britain over Oregon reached its endgame. Polk reiterated the “unquestioned” American claim to all of Oregon in his December 1845 annual message and vowed never to retreat from this position, but not long after Congress voted to begin the countdown to abrogating the joint occupation agreement, he let it be known to British negotiators that he would consider a compromise at 49 degrees so long as the Senate agreed to the plan. Robert Peel’s ministry, while outraged at the audacity of the Americans, calculated that the rapidly rising number of Americans in Oregon and the importance of maintaining good economic relations with the United States outweighed the insult to national honor and interest that compromise to some extent represented. Thus when a British compromise proposal drawing the boundary at 49 degrees as far as Puget Sound and limiting British navigation rights to the Columbia reached Washington in early June 1846, Polk presented it immediately for the Senate’s advice, announcing that he formally would present it for ratification if supported by two-thirds of the Senate. By placing the onus on the Senate, Polk kept his pledge that he would not compromise on the Oregon question. Preoccupied with the war with Mexico, the Senate passed the Oregon Treaty on June 15 by a 41–14 vote.","['December 1845', 'annual', 'early June 1846', 'June 15']",war mexico loom diplomatic dance britain oregon reach endgame polk reiterate “ unquestioned claim oregon december 1845 annual message vow retreat position long congress vote begin countdown abrogate joint occupation agreement let know british negotiator consider compromise 49 degree long senate agree plan robert peel ’s ministry outraged audacity american calculate rapidly rise number american oregon importance maintain good economic relation united state outweigh insult national honor interest compromise extent represent british compromise proposal draw boundary 49 degree far puget sound limit british navigation right columbia reach washington early june 1846 polk present immediately senate ’s advice announce formally present ratification support third senate place onus senate polk keep pledge compromise oregon question preoccupy war mexico senate pass oregon treaty june 15 41–14 vote,124,"[1845, 1846]",1846,2,1850,1850
239,"Polk’s bold policy of confronting two external challenges at once even as the domestic consensus for union rapidly frayed has led some historians to label him as reckless.8 From a certain perspective, this is understandable. After all, Great Britain stood as by far the world’s leading power at the time, and the government in Mexico City (still the largest city in the Western Hemisphere) ruled an emerging state with a landmass nearly as large as that of the United States. Peel’s ministry had dispatched the compromise proposal only days before word had arrived in London of the outbreak of the war with Mexico. Had this information been available to them, it is possible that the British would have chosen war with a weakened and distracted United States. Yet Polk did not blink. Whatever the British stake in Oregon in the 1840s, he judged it highly unlikely they would test American military resolve a third time. If the Americans, against long odds, had been willing to take on the British Empire in 1776 and 1812, who could doubt that they might do it again? In the next showdown, the passion for Canada shown by the Hunters’ Lodges on the northern border might be rekindled and supported, and not tamped down, by the central government. Then the conquest of Canada might truly be, as Jefferson had envisioned, “a mere matter of marching.” Whatever their absolute advantage in ships, troops, and money, it made no sense for the British to confront a determined if weaker foe over some far-off claims, especially if that potential foe also had the role of your best trading partner. Polk lectured a member of Congress, “[T]he only way to treat John Bull was to look him straight in the eye; that I considered a bold and firm course on our part the pacific one; that if the Congress faltered or hesitated in their course, John Bull would immediately become arrogant and more grasping in his demands.”9 Polk the audacious had measured his opponent well. His bullying of John Bull had resulted in another American expansionist victory.","['only days', 'the 1840s', '1776', '1812']",polk ’s bold policy confront external challenge domestic consensus union rapidly fray lead historian label reckless.8 certain perspective understandable great britain stand far world ’s lead power time government mexico city large city western hemisphere rule emerge state landmass nearly large united state peel ’s ministry dispatch compromise proposal day word arrive london outbreak war mexico information available possible british choose war weakened distracted united state polk blink british stake oregon 1840s judge highly unlikely test military resolve time american long odd willing british empire 1776 1812 doubt showdown passion canada show hunters’ lodge northern border rekindle support tamp central government conquest canada truly jefferson envision “ mere matter marching ” absolute advantage ship troop money sense british confront determine weak foe far claim especially potential foe role good trading partner polk lecture member congress “ t]he way treat john bull look straight eye consider bold firm course pacific congress falter hesitate course john bull immediately arrogant grasp demands.”9 polk audacious measure opponent bullying john bull result expansionist victory,169,"[1840, 1776, 1812]",1809,3,1825,1850
240,"As for the Republic of Mexico, the facts strongly suggested that whatever seeming advantages it had in a showdown with the United States, it ultimately would be no match for the armies of Manifest Destiny. Santa Ana’s massive force had neither defeated the ragtag Texas rebels in 1836 nor challenged the Lone Star Republic’s independence since then. What chance could it have against an American military machine led by a cadre of disciplined and experienced officers, soldiered largely by the militant sons of the South, equipped with the most modern firearms and field artillery, and supported by a navy capable of projecting power to the shores of Mexico in support of an invasion? Polk saw an imperialist opportunity of unprecedented proportions, and he did not allow the potential domestic political consequences – the further undermining of the increasingly fragile unionist consensus – to inhibit him.

241,"The Mexican-American War had an unmistakable racial dimension. The assumption of Mexican inferiority – racial, religious, economic, political, cultural – informed discussion of the war even by those Americans opposed to it. By the 1840s, the liberal universalism of the revolutionary era had been supplanted by an early form of what later would be termed “social Darwinism.” This outlook assumed human existence to be a grim struggle for survival in which the superior races (of which the Anglo-Saxon was considered the best) would thrive, and presumed inferiors, such as the mixed-race Mexican people, would be subordinated if not made extinct. In this manner, the war would have a salutary effect on human affairs, at least in the minds of some people. Early in the conflict the Casket, a Cincinnati publication, opined, “The Mexicans will be led by this war to think of their weakness and inferiority.”10 Tennessean and future president Andrew Johnson cast the war as God’s punishment of Mexico’s corrupt and uncivilized nature: “[T]he Anglo-Saxon race has been selected as the rod of her retribution.”11 The stark contrast between the revolutionary transformations occurring within the United States and the seeming backwardness of Mexico gave the war the appearance to some of being a humanitarian endeavor lifting Mexico out of darkness.",['the 1840s'],mexican war unmistakable racial dimension assumption mexican inferiority – racial religious economic political cultural – inform discussion war american oppose 1840s liberal universalism revolutionary era supplant early form later term “ social darwinism ” outlook assume human existence grim struggle survival superior race anglo saxon consider good thrive presume inferior mix race mexican people subordinate extinct manner war salutary effect human affair mind people early conflict casket cincinnati publication opine “ mexican lead war think weakness inferiority.”10 tennessean future president andrew johnson cast war god ’s punishment mexico ’s corrupt uncivilized nature “ t]he anglo saxon race select rod retribution.”11 stark contrast revolutionary transformation occur united state backwardness mexico give war appearance humanitarian endeavor lift mexico darkness,117,[1840],1840,1,1850,1850
242,"Opposition began as soon as war was declared. On May 12, 1846, Horace Greeley editorialized in the New York Tribune, “People of the United States! Your rulers are precipitating you into a fathomless abyss of crime and calamity! Why sleep you thoughtless on its verge, as though this was not your business…. Awake and arrest the work of the butchery ere it shall be too late to preserve your souls from the guilt of wholesale slaughter!”13Ralph Waldo Emerson, perhaps the nation’s preeminent literary light, pronounced, “[T]he United States will conquer Mexico, but it will be as a man swallows arsenic, which brings him down in turn. Mexico will poison us.”14William Lloyd Garrison, notorious as the publisher of the nation’s foremost abolitionist newspaper the Liberator, characterized the war as transparently a slaveholder’s conspiracy “waged for basest ends.”15The poet James Russell Lowell gave expression to the same sentiment via a series of biting satires collectively known as the Biglow Papers, a lasting contribution to American literature. Henry David Thoreau made perhaps the most enduring protest against the war in his public address “Resistance to Civil Government.” Although widely known as “Civil Disobedience,” the original title better captures the ominous nature of Thoreau’s protest in that he did not advocate the principled violation of the law in the name of social change as later did Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Rather, Thoreau urged individuals to withdraw their loyalty from a union that both protected slavery and sought to expand it by waging wars of aggression against its neighbors. Resistance in this scheme acted as a form of individualized secession. Thoreau’s very public act of secession was matched in private by a growing number of other Americans whose consciences would not allow them to continue to rest easy in a union with slave holders.","['May 12, 1846']",opposition begin soon war declare 12 1846 horace greeley editorialize new york tribune “ people united state ruler precipitate fathomless abyss crime calamity sleep thoughtless verge business … awake arrest work butchery ere shall late preserve soul guilt wholesale slaughter!”13ralph waldo emerson nation ’s preeminent literary light pronounced “ t]he united state conquer mexico man swallow arsenic bring turn mexico poison us.”14william lloyd garrison notorious publisher nation ’s foremost abolitionist newspaper liberator characterize war transparently slaveholder ’s conspiracy “ wag base ends.”15the poet james russell lowell give expression sentiment series bite satire collectively know biglow paper last contribution literature henry david thoreau enduring protest war public address “ resistance civil government ” widely know “ civil disobedience ” original title better capture ominous nature thoreau ’s protest advocate principled violation law social change later gandhi martin luther king jr thoreau urge individual withdraw loyalty union protect slavery seek expand wag war aggression neighbor resistance scheme act form individualized secession thoreau ’s public act secession match private grow number american conscience allow continue rest easy union slave holder,177,[1846],1846,1,1850,1850
243,"Like the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War kindled intense divisions that threatened national unity. It intensified the abolitionist movement and radicalized many Northern antislavery Whigs by forcing them to acknowledge that slavery was not going to die a quiet death on the American political stage. While opposition to the war centered in the North and in the Whig party, some Democrats opposed it, perhaps most notably the old warhorse John C. Calhoun. As a Southerner and a slave owner, Calhoun might be expected to at least acquiesce in the war if not actively support it. But he spoke out against it with all his might: In February 1847 he said to Congress, “[E]very Senator knows that I was opposed to the war; but none knows but myself the depth of that opposition. With my conceptions of its character and consequences, it was impossible for me to vote for it … I said to many of my friends that a deed had been done from which the country would not be able to recover for a long time, if ever … it has closed the first volume of our political history under the constitution, and opened the second, and that no mortal could tell what would be written in it.”17Not only writers and politicians opposed the war. Ulysses S. Grant, a recent graduate of West Point who served with distinction in the struggle, later wrote to a friend, “I do not think there was ever a more wicked war … I thought so at the time … only I had not moral courage enough to resign…. I had the horror of the Mexican War, and I have always believed that it was on our part most unjust.”18",['February 1847'],like war 1812 mexican war kindle intense division threaten national unity intensify abolitionist movement radicalize northern antislavery whig force acknowledge slavery go die quiet death political stage opposition war center north whig party democrat oppose notably old warhorse john c. calhoun southerner slave owner calhoun expect acquiesce war actively support speak february 1847 say congress “ e]very senator know oppose war know depth opposition conception character consequence impossible vote … say friend deed country able recover long time … close volume political history constitution open second mortal tell write it.”17not writer politician oppose war ulyss s. grant recent graduate west point serve distinction struggle later write friend “ think wicked war … think time … moral courage resign … horror mexican war believe unjust.”18,124,[1847],1847,1,1850,1850
244,"A certain class of Americans opposed the war, but the combination of reflexive support for soldiers under fire, a string of stirring military victories, and a burgeoning national media market in which daily reports from the front were for the first time widely and affordably available, kindled a mass enthusiasm for the conflict especially in the early going. Large pro-war rallies – estimated at twenty thousand in Philadelphia and even larger in New York – inflamed the public mind with a vision of chivalrous American warriors in the tradition of Washington bringing freedom to a benighted people at the barrel of a gun. Popular writer George Lippard suggested a direct link between the victory at Bunker Hill and the “establishing in the valley of Mexico, a new dominion – THE EMPIRE OF FREEDOM.”19 Commodore Robert F. Stockton, who played a prominent role in the annexation of California, declared to an enthusiastic audience in Philadelphia in 1847 that “the glory of the achievements there … is in the establishment of the first free press in California – in having built the first school house in California – in having established religious toleration as well as civil liberty in California.” Stockton argued that the duty from which America “dare not shrink” was “redeeming Mexico from misrule and civil strife.”20The creation of a new generation of American warriors suitable for “the hero worship” advocated by the popular contemporary English writer Thomas Carlyle functioned to allay anxieties about the rapid changes in ways of living being wrought by industrialization. Notwithstanding the moral and political objections of many to the war, the nationalist imperative to support American troops under fire limited dissent. Polk took direct aim at the war’s critics. In his second annual message in December 1846 he accused those who questioned the war’s origins of giving “aid and comfort” to Mexico (i.e., committing an act of treason), adding, “[A] more effectual means could not have been devised to encourage the enemy and protract the war than to advocate and adhere to their cause.”21","['daily', '–', '1847', 'annual', 'December 1846']",certain class american oppose war combination reflexive support soldier fire string stirring military victory burgeon national medium market daily report time widely affordably available kindle mass enthusiasm conflict especially early go large pro war rally – estimate thousand philadelphia large new york – inflame public mind vision chivalrous warrior tradition washington bring freedom benighted people barrel gun popular writer george lippard suggest direct link victory bunker hill “ establish valley mexico new dominion – empire freedom.”19 commodore robert f. stockton play prominent role annexation california declare enthusiastic audience philadelphia 1847 “ glory achievement … establishment free press california – have build school house california – have establish religious toleration civil liberty california ” stockton argue duty america “ dare shrink ” “ redeem mexico misrule civil strife.”20the creation new generation warrior suitable “ hero worship ” advocate popular contemporary english writer thomas carlyle function allay anxiety rapid change way live work industrialization notwithstanding moral political objection war nationalist imperative support troop fire limited dissent polk take direct aim war ’s critic second annual message december 1846 accuse question war ’s origin give “ aid comfort ” mexico i.e. commit act treason add “ effectual mean devise encourage enemy protract war advocate adhere cause.”21,203,"[1847, 1846]",1846,2,1850,1850
245,"After taking control of Matamoros, Taylor led his army on a daring march deep into Mexican territory. Far removed from resupply or reinforcement, the American army lived off the land as it advanced, requisitioning supplies as needed from the mostly indigenous people in its path. By summer, Taylor and his troops stood before the imposing fortress at Monterey, taking it only after a bitter house-by-house struggle. The ornate architecture and exotic locale of Mexico prompted some American soldiers to regard themselves as latter-day knights-errant of the sort popularized by the novelist Sir Walter Scott. After taking Monterey, Taylor stopped his advance to await further diplomatic developments. As a Whig, he was reluctant to press his advantage so as to deprive Polk of leverage to make ever more outrageous claims on Mexico. Taylor’s army of invasion made one last rendezvous with history when his force, composed largely of inexperienced volunteers and outnumbered between 2 and 3 to 1, held the line against a counterattacking Mexican army at the Battle of Buena Vista in February 1847. At that point, Taylor dug in to await a diplomatic end to the conflict.","['summer', 'February 1847']",take control matamoros taylor lead army daring march deep mexican territory far remove resupply reinforcement army live land advance requisitioning supply need indigenous people path summer taylor troop stand impose fortress monterey take bitter house house struggle ornate architecture exotic locale mexico prompt soldier regard day knight errant sort popularize novelist sir walter scott take monterey taylor stop advance await diplomatic development whig reluctant press advantage deprive polk leverage outrageous claim mexico taylor ’s army invasion rendezvous history force compose largely inexperienced volunteer outnumber 2 3 1 hold line counterattack mexican army battle buena vista february 1847 point taylor dig await diplomatic end conflict,104,[1847],1847,1,1850,1850
246,"Historians have long seen the Mexican-American War as a dress rehearsal for the Civil War, and for good reason: The war gave an entire generation of officers combat experience that proved critical to their service in the much larger war to follow, including Robert E. Lee, Ulysses Grant, Jefferson Davis, James Longstreet, George McClellan, and many more. West Point graduates comprised a substantial portion of the officer corps, validating Jefferson’s establishment in 1802 of a national military academy. The naval blockade of Mexico’s ports on both its Atlantic and its Pacific coasts prevented the Mexican army from being resupplied from abroad and previewed a strategy that would be critically important in the Civil War. Moreover, the mania for war news greatly accelerated the construction of telegraph lines along the East Coast; by the end of the war, the telegraph wire connected cities from Boston to Charleston.","['1802', 'the end of the']",historian long see mexican war dress rehearsal civil war good reason war give entire generation officer combat experience prove critical service large war follow include robert e. lee ulyss grant jefferson davis james longstreet george mcclellan west point graduate comprise substantial portion officer corp validate jefferson ’s establishment 1802 national military academy naval blockade mexico ’s port atlantic pacific coast prevent mexican army resuppli abroad preview strategy critically important civil war mania war news greatly accelerate construction telegraph line east coast end war telegraph wire connect city boston charleston,89,[1802],1802,1,1825,1850
247,"Although it is true that the Mexican-American War served to prepare the U.S. military for the coming conflagration, it must be noted that every American war, to one degree or another, has been a dress rehearsal for the next one. Even by the 1840s the American military tradition had built on a legacy of individual valor and institutional memory to create a fighting force that, man for man, arguably was the best in the world at that time. The Mexican-American War served notice to the European powers not to take American military might lightly, whatever the minuscule size of its peacetime force. The war did result in some distinct and crucial institutional knowledge: It gave the central government its first experience in conquering a foreign country. Heretofore, America’s wars with other nation-states had been to defend its own territory, and with the exception of the numerous failed efforts to take Canada, it had not attempted the force projection necessary to invade and conquer a foreign state. The Mexican-American War changed that, and the national government emerged from the conflict much more capable of marshaling and projecting military power.",['the 1840s'],true mexican war serve prepare u.s military come conflagration note war degree dress rehearsal 1840s military tradition build legacy individual valor institutional memory create fighting force man man arguably good world time mexican war serve notice european power military lightly minuscule size peacetime force war result distinct crucial institutional knowledge give central government experience conquer foreign country heretofore america ’s war nation state defend territory exception numerous fail effort canada attempt force projection necessary invade conquer foreign state mexican war change national government emerge conflict capable marshal project military power,90,[1840],1840,1,1850,1850
248,"It proved to be one of the first large-scale amphibious assaults in modern history and the largest in American history until World War II. In March 1847, Scott’s cannons pounded the city of Vera Cruz and its inhabitants, both military and civilian, with six thousand shells, thereby reducing its stone architecture to rubble. Vera Cruz soon fell, an astounding triumph of planning, logistics, and courage. From there, Scott’s army retraced the path of the conquistadors 250 miles to Mexico City, fighting and winning all of the numerous engagements it faced en route, including a decisive encounter at Cerro Gordo, a Mexican stronghold in a rocky and steep mountain canyon. American troops disassembled their artillery pieces and hauled them by block and tackle up and down the steep canyon to positions behind the Mexican lines, surprising the enemy with deadly fire from the rear. Some 3,000 Mexican soldiers surrendered to Scott, who quickly disarmed and paroled them before resuming the march of the “Army of Conquest” inland.",['March 1847'],"prove large scale amphibious assault modern history large history world war ii march 1847 scott ’s cannon pound city vera cruz inhabitant military civilian thousand shell reduce stone architecture rubble vera cruz soon fall astounding triumph planning logistic courage scott ’s army retrace path conquistador 250 mile mexico city fight win numerous engagement face en route include decisive encounter cerro gordo mexican stronghold rocky steep mountain canyon troop disassemble artillery piece haul block tackle steep canyon position mexican line surprise enemy deadly fire rear 3,000 mexican soldier surrender scott quickly disarm parole resume march “ army conquest ” inland",99,[1847],1847,1,1850,1850
249,"The Mexican-American War represented another example of the dynamic expandability of the American military. From a prewar force of about 8,000 troops, by war’s end the army numbered approximately 120,000, some 73,000 of whom were volunteers. Many of these volunteers had previous military training, and most of them came from the southern states. A core of experienced and skilled officers allowed for the efficient and effective increase in the nation’s forces in a short time. One authority has pronounced American artillery “the equal if not the superior” to any of its time.23 The engineering skills of the officer corps had proven enormously valuable to the efficient projection of military force. It was an innovative approach, which avoided the massive cost of maintaining a permanently large military establishment without compromising the nation’s security. By conventional assessments – the size of its standing military force – the United States did not pose much of a threat on the world stage. However, considering how quickly and effectively that small force could be expanded and deployed, and how minimal annual military expenditures meant huge savings related to the costs associated with maintaining a large force in readiness, even in the 1840s the United States ranked as a first-rate military power.","['annual', 'the 1840s']","mexican war represent example dynamic expandability military prewar force 8,000 troop war ’s end army number approximately 120,000 73,000 volunteer volunteer previous military training come southern state core experienced skilled officer allow efficient effective increase nation ’s force short time authority pronounce artillery “ equal superior ” time.23 engineering skill officer corp prove enormously valuable efficient projection military force innovative approach avoid massive cost maintain permanently large military establishment compromise nation ’s security conventional assessment – size stand military force – united state pose threat world stage consider quickly effectively small force expand deploy minimal annual military expenditure mean huge saving relate cost associate maintain large force readiness 1840s united state rank rate military power",115,[1840],1840,1,1850,1850
250,"Anticipating a short war, Polk acted to extract a favorable settlement almost immediately after hostilities began. His first gambit sought to employ Lopez de Santa Ana – ousted as president in 1844 and currently in exile in Cuba – in a scheme to bring the old dictator back to power and then reward the United States for its help with hefty territorial concessions in a peace treaty. Santa Ana returned to Mexico from Cuba on a British warship and received special permission to cross the American blockade. Once back in Mexico City, however, Santa Ana betrayed Polk and vigorously sought both to energize the Mexican resistance and to restore himself to power. When word of this sordid scheme leaked out, critics lambasted it as a blow to America’s integrity. It is true that Polk’s audacity usually served him well as president, but in allowing himself to be gulled by Santa Ana, he overplayed his hand, to the detriment of his own and the nation’s reputation.",['1844'],anticipate short war polk act extract favorable settlement immediately hostility begin gambit seek employ lopez de santa ana – oust president 1844 currently exile cuba – scheme bring old dictator power reward united state help hefty territorial concession peace treaty santa ana return mexico cuba british warship receive special permission cross blockade mexico city santa ana betray polk vigorously seek energize mexican resistance restore power word sordid scheme leak critic lambast blow america ’s integrity true polk ’s audacity usually serve president allow gull santa ana overplay hand detriment nation ’s reputation,92,[1844],1844,1,1850,1850
251,"In April 1847 he selected Nicholas P. Trist, the chief clerk in the Department of State, as a special envoy to attempt to persuade the Mexicans to make peace on American terms. In his youth Trist had been a protégé of Jefferson, and that, along with his long government service, made him a reasonable choice for this important mission. The terms of Mexico’s capitulation were to include the unconditional recognition of Texas annexation, with a border at the Rio Grande, and the purchase of Alta California and New Mexico for no more than $20 million. In addition, Mexico would be required to pay the long-standing claims against it by American citizens. Once in Mexico, Trist revealed himself as a diplomat to be something of a free agent. Linking up with Scott in Vera Cruz, Trist soon took to feuding with the aged general over matters of authority and protocol to a point where the two men refused to speak to one another, communicating only by letter. It is said that a timely offer of guava marmalade from Trist to an ill Scott repaired relations between the two men, and the two began to work together to produce a deal with the Santa Ana government. In August, Scott halted his troops a few miles outside Mexico City while a brief armistice was declared to allow for talks. Mexican negotiators agreed to acknowledge the fact of Texas annexation but continued to claim the Nueces as the boundary and demanded that the United States pay the costs of the war. Scott then prepared his assault on Mexico City.","['April 1847', 'August']",april 1847 select nicholas p. trist chief clerk department state special envoy attempt persuade mexican peace term youth trist protégé jefferson long government service reasonable choice important mission term mexico ’s capitulation include unconditional recognition texas annexation border rio grande purchase alta california new mexico 20 million addition mexico require pay long stand claim citizen mexico trist reveal diplomat free agent link scott vera cruz trist soon take feud aged general matter authority protocol point man refuse speak communicate letter say timely offer guava marmalade trist ill scott repair relation man begin work produce deal santa ana government august scott halt troop mile outside mexico city brief armistice declare allow talk mexican negotiator agree acknowledge fact texas annexation continue claim nuece boundary demand united state pay cost war scott prepare assault mexico city,133,[1847],1847,1,1850,1850
252,"Monitoring events in Washington, Polk fretted when he discovered that Trist and General Scott were working together to craft a deal. One of the purposes of sending Trist in the first place had been to deprive Scott, a staunch Whig and likely presidential contender in 1848, from getting the credit for winning both the war and the peace. In early 1847, California and New Mexico had seemed an adequate recompense for the war; by the fall, however, the lengthening list of American victories along with Mexico’s obstinate refusal to yield seemed to suggest a need for further territorial concessions.","['1848', 'early 1847', 'the fall']",monitor event washington polk fret discover trist general scott work craft deal purpose send trist place deprive scott staunch whig likely presidential contender 1848 get credit win war peace early 1847 california new mexico adequate recompense war fall lengthen list victory mexico ’s obstinate refusal yield suggest need territorial concession,50,"[1848, 1847]",1848,2,1850,1850
253,"Yet punishment was not the sole reason advocated for total absorption. Some opinion makers began to push the idea of “All of Mexico” as a way to “regenerate” the Mexican people, redeeming them from political chaos and economic backwardness. In contrast to California, where a fertile land needed to be liberated from a backward government and redeemed in the name of progress, the All of Mexico faction idealistically urged the American people to take up what later would be called “the white man’s burden” and absorb the presumed benighted population to the south. One of the most noted advocates for All of Mexico was Moses Y. Beach, failed peacemaker, whose New York Sun stood out as one of the most energetic voices of Manifest Destiny in the press and featured regular columns by John L. O’Sullivan. Beach rationalized that the Mexicans were “perfectly accustomed to being conquered, and the only new lesson we shall teach them is that our victories will give liberty, safety, and prosperity to the vanquished, if they know enough to profit by the appearance of our stars. To liberate and ennoble – not to enslave and debase – is our mission.”24 O’Sullivan, writing in the Philadelphia Public Ledger in December 1847, envisioned an institutional takeover of Mexico’s government, its legal system, its revenue sources, and its schools. After that, “Our Yankee young fellows and the pretty senoritas will do the rest of the annexation, and Mexico will soon be Anglo-Saxonized, and prepared for the confederacy.”25 In this case, regeneration of a people seemed to imply its racial whitening, but what is astounding in the calls for All of Mexico is the unhesitating self-confidence that Yankees would be greeted as liberators by the masses of Mexican people and that the United States had it within its power to absorb and transform an entire nation, rebirthing it in its own image.",['December 1847'],punishment sole reason advocate total absorption opinion maker begin push idea “ mexico ” way “ regenerate ” mexican people redeem political chaos economic backwardness contrast california fertile land need liberate backward government redeem progress mexico faction idealistically urge people later call “ white man ’s burden ” absorb presume benighted population south note advocate mexico mos y. beach fail peacemaker new york sun stand energetic voice manifest destiny press feature regular column john l. o’sullivan beach rationalize mexican “ perfectly accustomed conquer new lesson shall teach victory liberty safety prosperity vanquish know profit appearance star liberate ennoble – enslave debase – mission.”24 o’sullivan write philadelphia public ledger december 1847 envision institutional takeover mexico ’s government legal system revenue source school “ yankee young fellow pretty senorita rest annexation mexico soon anglo saxoniz prepare confederacy.”25 case regeneration people imply racial whitening astounding call mexico unhesitat self confidence yankee greet liberator mass mexican people united state power absorb transform entire nation rebirth image,162,[1847],1847,1,1850,1850
254,"In any case, Polk used the calls heard in the press and in Congress as a basis for new demands on Mexico. In October 1847, he recalled Trist to Washington as a preliminary to a new, tougher line. But Trist refused to be recalled. When the president’s message arrived, Mexico City had fallen along with Santa Ana’s latest regime, and a new government seemed eager to treat on Trist’s original terms. With Scott’s encouragement, Trist began talks with Mexican officials along the lines of his original instructions: Mexico to cede Alta California, New Mexico (comprising parts of half a dozen future states), and a Texas boundary at the Rio Grande, a total of approximately 500,000 square miles. Mexico in exchange received $15 million, and the United States agreed to assume the claims held against it. Signed on February 2, 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, named for the small village where it was negotiated, also promised to respect the civil rights of the Californios, Nuevo Mexicanos, and Tejanos, who inhabited the conquered territories – a clause of the treaty that in future years was for the most part ignored.","['October 1847', 'February 2, 1848', 'future years']","case polk call hear press congress basis new demand mexico october 1847 recall trist washington preliminary new tough line trist refuse recall president ’s message arrive mexico city fall santa ana ’s late regime new government eager treat trist ’s original term scott ’s encouragement trist begin talk mexican official line original instruction mexico cede alta california new mexico comprise part half dozen future state texas boundary rio grande total approximately 500,000 square mile mexico exchange receive 15 million united state agree assume claim hold sign february 2 1848 treaty guadalupe hidalgo name small village negotiate promise respect civil right californios nuevo mexicano tejano inhabit conquer territory – clause treaty future year ignore",113,"[1847, 1848]",1848,2,1850,1850

He, along with a few rabidly expansionist Democrats in Congress, still harbored visions of a boundary as far south as Tampico on the Gulf of Mexico, with Baja California also included in an expanded concession package. However, insofar as the pact obtained virtually all of Polk’s original aims, it proved impossible to bury it; a war-weary public was amazed at the extent of the territory the treaty had acquired and did not want to fight for more. In the name of expediency, Polk agreed to submit it to Congress. On March 10, 1848, the Senate voted to ratify the treaty 38–14. The “yes” voters included twelve Whigs, some of whom feared that rejecting the pact would lead to the absorption of another chunk of Mexico, as Polk desired. Six Democrats opposed the treaty for the opposite reason – that the treaty had not dispossessed Mexico of enough of its territory.","['March 10, 1848']",trist ’s insubordination enrage polk trist return washington treaty ratification polk contemplate submit congress rabidly expansionist democrat congress harbor vision boundary far south tampico gulf mexico baja california include expand concession package insofar pact obtain virtually polk ’s original aim prove impossible bury war weary public amazed extent territory treaty acquire want fight expediency polk agree submit congress march 10 1848 senate vote ratify treaty 38–14 “ yes ” voter include whig fear reject pact lead absorption chunk mexico polk desire democrat oppose treaty opposite reason – treaty dispossess mexico territory,91,[1848],1848,1,1850,1850
256,"Yerba Buena was soon emptied of its able-bodied men, many of whom purchased picks, shovels, and other mining supplies from Brannan, who understood that the most reliable way to wealth was to sell picks to the would-be prospectors. When President Polk confirmed the strike in his final annual message of December 1848, the gold rush became national, even international in scope, attracting people from China, Sonora, Europe, and South America as well as the United States. Steamship companies advertised transportation to the “inexhaustible” gold mines of California, of great wealth to be had for the taking if only one could get there.26","['annual', 'December 1848']",yerba buena soon empty able bodied man purchase pick shovel mining supply brannan understand reliable way wealth sell pick prospector president polk confirm strike final annual message december 1848 gold rush national international scope attract people china sonora europe south america united state steamship company advertise transportation “ inexhaustible ” gold mine california great wealth taking there.26,57,[1848],1848,1,1850,1850
257,"In its timing and long-term consequence, the discovery of gold in California in the wake of its acquisition remains perhaps the single greatest piece of luck in American history. In a matter of months, California went from being a dream in the eye of expansionist visionaries to a key part of the American Empire, the ultimate land of opportunity in the land of opportunity. San Francisco almost immediately became a major Pacific emporium, a keystone between goods and people arriving from the East Coast and Europe and those coming from the Asian-Pacific region. By the early 1850s, tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants were coming by boat from Canton, lured to California by reports of a fabled “gold mountain” to be had. By 1860, approximately $500 million in gold had been extracted from the region; the establishment of the San Francisco mint in 1854 allowed the gold to be monetized into hard currency, providing a reliable and much-needed medium of exchange. Together with the increasing commercial penetration of China, the establishment of Hawaii as a de facto protectorate, and the subsequent “opening” of Japan, the gold rush marks the definitive beginning of the United States as a Pacific power.","['months', 'the early 1850s', '1860', '1854']",timing long term consequence discovery gold california wake acquisition remain single great piece luck history matter month california go dream eye expansionist visionary key empire ultimate land opportunity land opportunity san francisco immediately major pacific emporium keystone good people arrive east coast europe come asian pacific region early 1850 ten thousand chinese immigrant come boat canton lure california report fabled “ gold mountain ” 1860 approximately 500 million gold extract region establishment san francisco mint 1854 allow gold monetize hard currency provide reliable need medium exchange increase commercial penetration china establishment hawaii de facto protectorate subsequent “ opening ” japan gold rush mark definitive beginning united state pacific power,109,"[1850, 1860, 1854]",1855,3,1875,1900
258,"The discovery of gold in California gave a dramatic boost to what had been a slowly growing U.S. interest in a Central American isthmian crossing. The Isthmus of Panama had long seemed to be the most likely place for such a crossing, but engineers also eyed alternative possible routes in Honduras, Nicaragua, and across Tehuantepec in Mexico. Although an interoceanic canal remained a distant dream, by 1850 plans commenced to build a railroad connecting Atlantic and Pacific ports. Americans had been exploring the possibilities of an isthmian crossing since the 1820s; the acquisition of Oregon in 1846 heightened interest in what was the most strategic locale in the hemisphere south of the Rio Grande. As the imperial republic expanded westward toward Asia by land and by sea, the critical importance of Panama became undeniable. Recognizing this, the Polk administration moved to secure the American presence in Panama. In 1846, the Bidlack-Mallarmino Treaty with Colombia (then known as Nueva Granada) designated the United States as the guarantor both of Colombia’s continued sovereignty and of the international right of transit across the isthmus. Little known today, the Bidlack Treaty marked another significant step in the creation of both a hemispheric and a global American Empire. It made a nice counterweight to the rising British influence over the coastal region of Nicaragua known as the Mosquito Coast. Once again Americans contended with the British for influence over a distant region.","['1850', 'the 1820s', '1846', '1846', 'today']",discovery gold california give dramatic boost slowly grow u.s interest central isthmian crossing isthmus panama long likely place crossing engineer eyed alternative possible route hondura nicaragua tehuantepec mexico interoceanic canal remain distant dream 1850 plan commence build railroad connect atlantic pacific port american explore possibility isthmian crossing 1820s acquisition oregon 1846 heighten interest strategic locale hemisphere south rio grande imperial republic expand westward asia land sea critical importance panama undeniable recognize polk administration move secure presence panama 1846 bidlack mallarmino treaty colombia know nueva granada designate united state guarantor colombia ’s continue sovereignty international right transit isthmus little known today bidlack treaty mark significant step creation hemispheric global empire nice counterweight rise british influence coastal region nicaragua know mosquito coast american contend british influence distant region,126,"[1850, 1820, 1846, 1846]",1840,4,1850,1850

Relations with the nations of Latin America generally and Central America in particular had been marked by suspicion bordering on contempt from the time of the recognition controversy of 1817. The Monroe administration had made it clear that its proclamation of the principles of nonintervention and noncolonization did not necessarily imply a willingness to apply them multilaterally. Americans had no more desire to become “entangled” with other states in the hemisphere than they did with those in Europe. Southern members of Congress actively sought to limit diplomatic contacts with Latin America, quashing U.S. efforts to participate in the Panama Congress of 1826.

Overland, immigrants faced a rugged journey along a cholera-pocked trail and extremes of heat and cold, usually taking about four months to go from St. Louis to the gold fields. The ocean voyage via the rough waters of Cape Horn was fourteen thousand miles and also took four to five months. The isthmian crossing, in contrast – involving two relatively short boat trips sandwiched around a three- to ten-day journey via foot and bongos, the canoelike vessels used for centuries to ferry people from one ocean to the other – took six to eight weeks. As early as 1847, the U.S. Mail Steamship Company (headed by George Law) and the Pacific Mail Company (headed by William Aspinwall) established a privately owned and government-subsidized mail service to the West Coast via the isthmus. By the mid-1850s, Cornelius Vanderbilt had built a railroad line connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific.28","['annual', 'December 1848', 'about four months', 'four to five months', 'ten-day', 'centuries', 'six to eight weeks', '1847', 'the mid-1850s']",canal canal polk ’s confirmation discovery gold annual message congress december 1848 escalate importance panama fast way california overland immigrant face rugged journey cholera pock trail extreme heat cold usually take month st louis gold field ocean voyage rough water cape horn fourteen thousand mile take month isthmian crossing contrast – involve relatively short boat trip sandwich three- day journey foot bongo canoelike vessel century ferry people ocean – take week early 1847 u.s mail steamship company head george law pacific mail company head william aspinwall establish privately own government subsidize mail service west coast isthmus mid-1850 cornelius vanderbilt build railroad line connect atlantic pacific.28,105,"[1848, 1847, 1850]",1848,3,1850,1850
261,"By 1849, the United States and Great Britain, having only recently averted a conflict over Oregon, found themselves in an emerging rivalry over who would control the canal they knew would eventually be built somewhere in Central America. It was obvious that if a canal were constructed, it would be of crucial importance in the emerging world economy. Neither nation wanted to concede the right to build and own a canal, but neither did they wish to fight over it. In 1850, Secretary of State John Clayton and British minister Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer negotiated an agreement in which both parties pledged never to make a bid for exclusive control of a future canal, to guarantee the neutrality of any canal, and to refrain from direct control over the Central American states in the region. Although the agreement did defuse Anglo-American tensions, it is anomalous in the history of American foreign relations in that it contained a self-denying ordinance of the sort that American statecraft tried to avoid as a cardinal principle. Yet in certain respects the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty merely reprised the joint occupation agreement over Oregon, affirming an American claim to the region without the need to directly confront Great Britain over it, at least at that time.","['1849', '1850']",1849 united state great britain have recently avert conflict oregon find emerge rivalry control canal know eventually build central america obvious canal construct crucial importance emerge world economy nation want concede right build canal wish fight 1850 secretary state john clayton british minister sir henry lytton bulwer negotiate agreement party pledge bid exclusive control future canal guarantee neutrality canal refrain direct control central state region agreement defuse anglo tension anomalous history foreign relation contain self deny ordinance sort statecraft try avoid cardinal principle certain respect clayton bulwer treaty merely reprise joint occupation agreement oregon affirm claim region need directly confront great britain time,103,"[1849, 1850]",1850,2,1875,1900
262,"The war on Mexico had gone better than Polk or anyone else could have anticipated. True, it had cost approximately twelve thousand American lives (the abysmal sanitary conditions, especially for the volunteers, meant that most of the deaths had been non–combat related); it had cost the U.S. Treasury approximately $100 million, plus the roughly $20 million in costs associated with the peace treaty. It had cost the lives of an estimated fifty thousand Mexicans – soldiers and civilians – along with the devastation of large portions of Mexico. The behavior of the invading American troops had been at times atrocious, and Mexico emerged from the war having lost half its territory and much of its sense of national dignity. However, the war had provided inestimable imperial benefits to the United States: In addition to the massive territorial gains, the war affirmed the undisputed superiority of the United States in the Western Hemisphere. The Monroe Doctrine had been invoked and applied for all to see; by themselves, the bonanza of the gold strike in California and the subsequent silver rush in Nevada justified the costs of the war, at least in material terms. The loud and principled opposition to the war fell mute in the peace, and the loudest opponent of them all, John Quincy Adams, could no longer be heard, having died from a stroke suffered in February 1848 while at his congressional desk.","['–', 'February 1848']",war mexico go good polk anticipate true cost approximately thousand life abysmal sanitary condition especially volunteer mean death non – combat relate cost u.s treasury approximately 100 million plus roughly 20 million cost associate peace treaty cost life estimate thousand mexican – soldier civilian – devastation large portion mexico behavior invade troop time atrocious mexico emerge war have lose half territory sense national dignity war provide inestimable imperial benefit united state addition massive territorial gain war affirm undisputed superiority united state western hemisphere monroe doctrine invoke apply bonanza gold strike california subsequent silver rush nevada justify cost war material term loud principled opposition war fall mute peace loud opponent john quincy adams longer hear have die stroke suffer february 1848 congressional desk,122,[1848],1848,1,1850,1850
263," The principled objections of Adams, Benton, Calhoun, and others paled in importance to the practical objections to the possible territorial acquisitions raised by David Wilmot, a Democrat House member from Pennsylvania. No friend of the abolitionists, Wilmot had voted for the war. But when in August 1846 Polk requested $2 million from Congress to pay for the “extraordinary expenses” incurred by the administration in dealing with foreign states (specifically the costs associated with bribing Mexican officials, starting with Santa Ana), Wilmot proposed to qualify the appropriation by adding to the House version a resolution barring slavery from any new lands acquired as a result of the war. Modeled along the lines of similar restrictions in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the resolution spoke not on behalf of slaves but on behalf of working-class white men, who could not successfully compete in a slave labor–based society and who did not want to inhabit a state with a large black population be it slave or free. For the survival of the Union, this represented an ominous turn of events. Wilmot championed the white working man who saw his opportunities foreshortened and the dignity of his labor impugned by the institution of slavery. This marked the birth of the Free Soil movement, a progenitor of the Republican party. Now the relatively few Americans who opposed slavery on principle would be joined by a mass of people who opposed it based on economic interest. What Wilmot himself called his “White Man’s Proviso” gave a mighty boost to those who sought to stop the further extension of slavery’s domain.29","['August 1846', '1787']",principled objection adam benton calhoun pal importance practical objection possible territorial acquisition raise david wilmot democrat house member pennsylvania friend abolitionist wilmot vote war august 1846 polk request 2 million congress pay “ extraordinary expense ” incur administration deal foreign state specifically cost associate bribe mexican official start santa ana wilmot propose qualify appropriation add house version resolution bar slavery new land acquire result war model line similar restriction northwest ordinance 1787 resolution speak behalf slave behalf work class white man successfully compete slave labor – base society want inhabit state large black population slave free survival union represent ominous turn event wilmot champion white work man see opportunity foreshorten dignity labor impugn institution slavery mark birth free soil movement progenitor republican party relatively american oppose slavery principle join mass people oppose base economic interest wilmot call “ white man ’s proviso ” give mighty boost seek stop extension slavery ’s domain.29,152,"[1846, 1787]",1816,2,1825,1850

Located on a knoll not far from Capitol Hill, at a projected height of more than five hundred feet the marble obelisk when completed would be the tallest man-made structure in the world, casting an imposing shadow over the still mostly unbuilt landscape of the capital. In contrast to the Greco-Roman architecture characteristic of most other public buildings in the capital, the Washington Monument bowed in the direction of Egypt, another ancient empire renowned for its monumentalism. And even though the Washington Monument did not rival the Pyramids in scale, it, along with the U.S. Capitol Building then under construction, stands among the preeminent architectural accomplishments of its time, symbolizing not only the nation’s preeminent founder but also the astounding energies and accomplishments of its people.

266,"The republican revolutions that broke out all across Europe that same year provided further evidence that the tide of world history flowed in an American direction. In dozens of European states, liberal democratic uprisings challenged the restorationist monarchical status quo. Americans attributed the upheaval in no small measure to their own democratic republican example. The European liberal revolutions so inspired some Americans as to prompt them to take part in the struggles, most famously the writer Margaret Fuller. Traveling to Rome in 1846 to cover the upheaval as a journalist, she soon married an Italian revolutionary, bore his child, and assumed a prominent role in the revolutionary movement. Only her journal survived her tragic death at sea in 1850 while she was returning home in the wake of the defeat of the revolutionary forces. Her colleague Thoreau later recovered this invaluable record from the wreckage of the ship off Long Island. Fuller’s waterlogged journal provided the best American eyewitness account of the continent-wide upheavals of 1848. That most of these revolutions ultimately failed did not lessen their impact as what many Americans perceived as another step on the way to universal human emancipation.","['same year', '1846', '1850', '1848']",republican revolution break europe year provide evidence tide world history flow direction dozen european state liberal democratic uprising challenge restorationist monarchical status quo american attribute upheaval small measure democratic republican example european liberal revolution inspire american prompt struggle famously writer margaret fuller travel rome 1846 cover upheaval journalist soon marry italian revolutionary bear child assume prominent role revolutionary movement journal survive tragic death sea 1850 return home wake defeat revolutionary force colleague thoreau later recover invaluable record wreckage ship long island full ’s waterlogged journal provide good eyewitness account continent wide upheaval 1848 revolution ultimately fail lessen impact american perceive step way universal human emancipation,105,"[1846, 1850, 1848]",1848,3,1850,1850
267,"A major turning point in European history, 1848 also proved significant in U.S. history. The Mexican-American War transformed the republic in many ways, among them being a greatly strengthened executive branch of government. James Polk became the first true commander in chief in U.S. history, the first president to assume close control of both the domestic and the foreign aspects of the struggle. He oversaw the domestic mobilization for war and had an unprecedented hands-on approach to the conduct of the war itself, thanks in large part to the enhanced communication offered by the telegraph, which allowed him to monitor and direct events on a daily basis. As the first American president to manage the conquest of a foreign state, Polk established a military government in Mexico, thereby pushing the limits of executive authority into new territory. On March 23, 1847, Polk had issued an executive order enabling American forces to take over Mexican customhouses and collect import duties to help defray the cost of the war. Polk justified this practice by what he termed the “right of the conqueror to levy contributions upon the enemy in their seaports, towns, or provinces.”1 The first U.S. experience in occupying a foreign nation resulted in a significant increase in the centralized power of the national government and became a key precedent for future commanders in chief.","['1848', 'daily', 'March 23, 1847']",major turning point european history 1848 prove significant u.s history mexican war transform republic way greatly strengthen executive branch government james polk true commander chief u.s history president assume close control domestic foreign aspect struggle oversee domestic mobilization war unprecedented hand approach conduct war thank large enhanced communication offer telegraph allow monitor direct event daily basis president manage conquest foreign state polk establish military government mexico push limit executive authority new territory march 23 1847 polk issue executive order enable force mexican customhouse collect import duty help defray cost war polk justify practice term “ right conqueror levy contribution enemy seaport town provinces.”1 u.s experience occupy foreign nation result significant increase centralized power national government key precedent future commander chief,120,"[1848, 1847]",1848,2,1850,1850
268,"The tumultuous events of 1848 climaxed with Polk’s official confirmation of the gold strike in newly acquired California. The mineral windfall of historic proportions seemingly provided further proof that God smiled on the American people. Polk’s ambitions for ports on the Pacific now seemed remarkably prescient and not a bit premature. The United States stood poised to become a Pacific power. The president envisioned a dynamic future: “By the possession of the safe and capacious harbors on the California coast we shall have great advantages in securing the rich commerce of the East, and thus obtain for our products new and increased markets.”2 California’s sudden emergence as a western terminus accelerated calls for the construction of a transcontinental railroad linking what had only a few years earlier been the seemingly unconquerable space between the oceans.","['1848', 'only a few years earlier']",tumultuous event 1848 climax polk ’s official confirmation gold strike newly acquire california mineral windfall historic proportion seemingly provide proof god smile people polk ’s ambition port pacific remarkably prescient bit premature united state stand poise pacific power president envision dynamic future “ possession safe capacious harbor california coast shall great advantage secure rich commerce east obtain product new increase markets.”2 california ’s sudden emergence western terminus accelerate call construction transcontinental railroad link year earlier seemingly unconquerable space ocean,79,[1848],1848,1,1850,1850
269,"The nearly 500,000 square miles acquired via the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo did not slake Polk’s expansionist desires. Nicholas Trist’s handiwork, however well received by Congress and the public, did not go nearly far enough for Polk, whose expanded ambitions for Mexico had been for a border at Tampico and a guarantee of the transit rights across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. As with the Oregon question, where Polk had used the cry of “54–40 or Fight” as leverage to gain a boundary at the forty-ninth parallel, he had wanted to use the extreme demands of the “all of Mexico” faction as a wedge to gain the lightly populated northern portion he really desired. Yet Trist’s defiance had frustrated this aim. For a while it appeared that the United States might acquire almost the entire western edge of the Caribbean basin. In 1847, a Mayan Indian revolt against the Creole population of the Yucatan Peninsula seemed to present an opportunity for the annexation of that part of Mexico as well. Outnumbered by the native population and effectively abandoned by authorities in far-off Mexico City, in early 1847 the Creoles began seeking the protection of a foreign government. They petitioned Spain, Great Britain, and the United States for help against the uprising, the result of centuries of oppressive rule by a numerically tiny, light-skinned elite. Polk urged Congress to respond to this call, if only to prevent an expansion of European power in the hemisphere in violation of the Monroe Doctrine. By mid-1848, however, the native rebellion receded and with it the hope that the Yucatan peninsula might be annexed. Thus the southern boundary remained at the Rio Grande, and the dreams for acquiring still more of Mexico became a tantalizing “What if?” in the history of the American Empire.","['forty-ninth', '1847', 'early 1847', 'centuries', 'mid-1848']","nearly 500,000 square mile acquire treaty guadalupe hidalgo slake polk ’s expansionist desire nicholas trist ’s handiwork receive congress public nearly far polk expand ambition mexico border tampico guarantee transit right isthmus tehuantepec oregon question polk cry “ 54–40 fight ” leverage gain boundary ninth parallel want use extreme demand “ mexico ” faction wedge gain lightly populate northern portion desire trist ’s defiance frustrate aim appear united state acquire entire western edge caribbean basin 1847 mayan indian revolt creole population yucatan peninsula present opportunity annexation mexico outnumber native population effectively abandon authority far mexico city early 1847 creole begin seek protection foreign government petition spain great britain united state help uprising result century oppressive rule numerically tiny light skinned elite polk urge congress respond prevent expansion european power hemisphere violation monroe doctrine mid-1848 native rebellion recede hope yucatan peninsula annex southern boundary remain rio grande dream acquire mexico tantalizing “ ” history empire",154,"[1847, 1847, 1848]",1847,3,1850,1850
270,"The territories acquired from Mexico did not lessen Polk’s intense interest in the annexation of Cuba. Cuba had long been an object of North American imperial desire. As early as 1805, Jefferson had contemplated its acquisition, remarking, “I have ever looked upon it as the most interesting addition that could be made to our system of states.” In 1823, John Quincy Adams had hypothesized a law of political gravity that destined Cuba to fall into the hands of the United States like a piece of rapidly ripening fruit. The island’s strategic position at the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico made it seem a natural extension of the North American union, especially after the annexation of Florida in 1819. The tenuous to nonexistent grounds by which the United States claimed Cuba necessitated imaginative justifications for its annexation. One such view suggested that Cuba belonged to the United States insofar as the island was deemed to consist of the accumulated American soil deposited offshore by the Mississippi River.","['1805', '1823', '1819']",territory acquire mexico lessen polk ’s intense interest annexation cuba cuba long object north imperial desire early 1805 jefferson contemplate acquisition remark “ look interesting addition system state ” 1823 john quincy adams hypothesize law political gravity destine cuba fall hand united state like piece rapidly ripen fruit island ’s strategic position mouth gulf mexico natural extension north union especially annexation florida 1819 tenuous nonexistent ground united state claim cuba necessitate imaginative justification annexation view suggest cuba belong united state insofar island deem consist accumulate soil deposit offshore mississippi river,90,"[1805, 1823, 1819]",1816,3,1825,1850

They had little patience for the cautious nationalism of older Jacksonians, whom they derided as old fogies. Taking their name from Ralph Waldo Emerson’s 1844 essay “The Young American,” this group waxed exuberant about the success of the United States and became intoxicated by contemplating the grand achievements that lay ahead. Senator Robert Stockton, who as a navy commodore had played a major role in the conquest of California, epitomized the attitude of the movement in a speech to Congress in 1852: “We are, in truth, the residuary legatees of all that the blood and treasure of mankind expended for four thousand years have accomplished in the cause of human freedom….

As concerns Cuba, the expansionist desire to enlarge the area of freedom mixed with the desire to expand and defend the institution of slavery and the way of life it represented. The impetus for annexation came from elements in Cuba as well as the United States. Slave-owning elites in Cuba, like those in the American South, uneasily eyed the rising abolitionist tide around them. They feared that Britain aimed to take Cuba in order to abolish slavery, part of its effort to create a global free-labor system. Like their counterparts in the South, Cuban slave owners feared that international agitation against slavery might precipitate another revolt as occurred in Haiti, leading to the prospect of unspeakable acts of violence and retribution against the elite.

For several months, O’Sullivan and others personally lobbied the administration to back a plan to purchase Cuba for $100 million. The canny Polk showed little interest in the scheme, keeping his focus on the still-unresolved war with Mexico. By mid-1848, however, Polk sprang into action. On June 9, the same day he received confirmation that the Mexican legislature had ratified the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, Polk prepared instructions to U.S. minister to Cuba Romulus Saunders authorizing him to offer Spain as much as $100 million for the island. Rumors that Cuba verged on revolt encouraged Polk to act. It seemed as if the old expansionist formula might work once more: A revolutionary party acts to seize power as a first step toward annexation by the United States. But Spain’s representatives in Cuba flatly refused negotiations of any sort, loudly declaring that they “would rather see Cuba sunk in the ocean” than see it sold to the United States.

275,"The change in presidential attitudes toward expansion prompted a change in tactics by the Cuban annexationist faction. The group now began to make plans for an invasion of the island to be led by the Venezuelan-born soldier of fortune Narciso Lopez. Lopez, almost forgotten today, for a while in the late 1840s and early 1850s dominated newspaper headlines with his various schemes to revolutionize Cuba in preparation for its admission to the Union. After arriving in New York in 1848 following an unsuccessful attempt to start a revolt in Cuba, Lopez joined with other Cuban annexationists (including O’Sullivan) to form the Junta Cubano. When the Club of Havana could not convince Mexican-American War general William Jenkins Worth to take command of an invasion force, Lopez had his opportunity. He became the public face of the annexationist clique: His long mustache and fancy uniformed attire met the public’s expectation of what a Cuban freedom fighter should look like. Working with annexationist cells in New Orleans, New York, Baltimore, and other cities, and aided by a network of Masonic allies, many of whom were themselves staunch Cuban annexationists, Lopez very publicly raised his clandestine army. In the fall of 1848, U.S. navy patrols quarantined and eventually broke up an invasion force of approximately 600 men gathered on Round Island outside New Orleans. Undaunted, Lopez and his followers, including Ambrosio Gonzalez, a Cuban-born American citizen who functioned as Lopez’s confidant and translator, continued to advertise for volunteers to join an invasion. In May 1850, Lopez landed an invasion force of about 500 men in the town of Cardenas. Flying the Lone Star flag that later would be the flag of an independent Cuba, Lopez’s force engaged in fierce fighting with Spanish troops, momentarily taking the town of Cardenas before frantically fleeing back to Key West with a Spanish warship in hot pursuit.","['today', 'the late 1840s', 'early 1850s', '1848', 'the fall of 1848', 'May 1850']",change presidential attitude expansion prompt change tactic cuban annexationist faction group begin plan invasion island lead venezuelan bear soldier fortune narciso lopez lopez forget today late 1840 early 1850 dominate newspaper headline scheme revolutionize cuba preparation admission union arrive new york 1848 follow unsuccessful attempt start revolt cuba lopez join cuban annexationist include o’sullivan form junta cubano club havana convince mexican war general william jenkins worth command invasion force lopez opportunity public face annexationist clique long mustache fancy uniformed attire meet public ’s expectation cuban freedom fighter look like work annexationist cell new orlean new york baltimore city aid network masonic ally staunch cuban annexationist lopez publicly raise clandestine army fall 1848 u.s navy patrol quarantine eventually break invasion force approximately 600 man gather round island outside new orlean undaunted lopez follower include ambrosio gonzalez cuban bear citizen function lopez ’s confidant translator continue advertise volunteer join invasion 1850 lopez land invasion force 500 man town cardenas fly lone star flag later flag independent cuba lopez ’s force engage fierce fighting spanish troop momentarily take town cardenas frantically flee key west spanish warship hot pursuit,185,"[1840, 1850, 1848, 1848, 1850]",1847,5,1850,1850
276,"Despite having twice failed to revolutionize Cuba, Lopez gained in celebrity upon his return to the United States.

However, his army, including a regiment commanded by William L. Crittenden, the son of a U.S. senator, encountered indifference from the Cuban people and brutality from the Spanish troops massed to defeat it. Capturing the rebels after fierce fighting, Spanish authorities publicly garroted Lopez in Havana on September 1, 1851; their summary execution by firing squad of Crittenden and fifty men under his command elicited howls of outrage and calls for vengeance from the North American press, but to no effect.

278,"Lopez was not the last soldier of fortune who aimed to revolutionize foreign lands during the 1850s. The impulse toward expansion south into Mexico and the Caribbean gained strength throughout the decade, boosted by private armies that became known as filibusters, from the Dutch word vribuiter, or “pirate.” These groups, often led by charismatic leaders of outsized ambitions, sought to conquer foreign lands without government sanction or support. For them, as Harris G. Warren memorably put it, “the sword was their passport.” These groups aimed to revolutionize foreign lands in the name of American-style freedom and then seek quick annexation to the United States. Although use of the term in this context dates from 1850, the most successful filibuster expedition occurred in Texas in 1835, when large numbers of armed men crossed the Sabine River intent on gaining independence from Mexico. The Jackson administration, while officially frowning on these activities, did little to stop them. Lax enforcement of the various federal neutrality statutes (most notably the 1818 act), combined with the difficulties of getting local juries to convict men accused of violating the neutrality laws, had resulted in a de facto invasion by a rebel army that proved essential to the success of the Texas Revolution. Although the expansion of slavery lay at the heart of virtually every filibustering expedition, a mantle of republican freedom disguised this fact. Intoxicated by the rhetoric of Manifest Destiny and often driven by a personal economic interest, filibusters saw themselves as the vanguard of the republican revolution.","['the 1850s', 'the decade', '1850', '1835', '1818']",lopez soldier fortune aim revolutionize foreign land 1850 impulse expansion south mexico caribbean gain strength decade boost private army know filibuster dutch word vribuiter “ pirate ” group lead charismatic leader outsized ambition seek conquer foreign land government sanction support harris g. warren memorably “ sword passport ” group aim revolutionize foreign land style freedom seek quick annexation united state use term context date 1850 successful filibuster expedition occur texas 1835 large number armed man cross sabine river intent gain independence mexico jackson administration officially frown activity little stop lax enforcement federal neutrality statute notably 1818 act combine difficulty get local jury convict man accuse violate neutrality law result de facto invasion rebel army prove essential success texas revolution expansion slavery lie heart virtually filibustering expedition mantle republican freedom disguise fact intoxicate rhetoric manifest destiny drive personal economic interest filibuster see vanguard republican revolution,144,"[1850, 1850, 1835, 1818]",1838,4,1850,1850
279,"The most famous (or, perhaps, infamous) of these filibusters was William Walker of Tennessee, the so-called Gray Eyed Man of Destiny. Slightly built and lacking any special training as an empire builder, Walker had abandoned a career as a physician to assume a self-appointed role as an agent of Manifest Destiny. He framed himself as the tip of the spear of American expansionism, a bold adventurer willing to do the hard work of opening new lands to the republican revolution. Possessed of a penetrating gaze and a single-minded determination to achieve great things, Walker attracted small groups of mercenaries to support his schemes by promises of great wealth to be had. His first forays into Baja California and Sonora in the early 1850s proved abortive, because poor planning and limited resources forced him to abandon both expeditions within days of their launch. Like Narciso Lopez, Walker was undeterred by failure. In 1856, Walker and sixty men he styled as “the immortals” succeeded in revolutionizing Nicaragua in the name of a great Central American slave empire he envisioned springing up in the region. Newspapers across the country could not get enough of his exploits; his bold actions captivated readers and sold papers, even if many editors had serious doubts about the legitimacy of his aims.","['the early 1850s', '1856']",famous infamous filibuster william walker tennessee call gray eyed man destiny slightly build lack special training empire builder walker abandon career physician assume self appoint role agent manifest destiny frame tip spear expansionism bold adventurer willing hard work open new land republican revolution possess penetrate gaze single minded determination achieve great thing walker attract small group mercenary support scheme promise great wealth foray baja california sonora early 1850 prove abortive poor planning limited resource force abandon expedition day launch like narciso lopez walker undeterr failure 1856 walker man style “ immortal ” succeed revolutionize nicaragua great central slave empire envision spring region newspaper country exploit bold action captivate reader sell paper editor doubt legitimacy aim,115,"[1850, 1856]",1853,2,1875,1900

Instead, his dictatorial ways proved to be his downfall. Walker and his ragtag army soon retreated from Nicaragua, chased out not by locals but by forces in the employ of railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who did not appreciate this upstart interfering with his plans to build a trans-isthmian railroad in Nicaragua. Evicted from Nicaragua, Walker returned home to a rapturous welcome by the many following his exploits in the papers. Refusing to be discouraged by his failures, Walker launched one more expedition against Nicaragua in 1860. With his tiny force facing annihilation by Honduran army units, Walker surrendered to a Royal navy schooner on patrol that he hoped would return him to the United States.

281,"Filibustering expeditions proliferated dramatically during the 1850s. Robert May, perhaps the preeminent authority on filibustering, estimates that at any given time during the decade, at least two filibustering schemes were in the planning or execution stage. Although it was often true that the leaders of these schemes sought, like Walker, to expand slavery to new regions in the Caribbean and Mexico, it is not fair to attribute the movement as a whole to a “slave power conspiracy” directed from a single command. In the end, the filibusterers are best understood as another manifestation of the ceaseless American expansionist quest for new lands, new opportunities, and new sources of wealth. However, antislavery activists understandably tended to see the actions of Walker and others as part of a transparent campaign to spread the slave institution south of the border. Robert May suggests that the resurgence of filibustering played a key role both in kindling Southern secessionist sentiments and in creating Republican resistance to compromise on the eve of the Civil War: “[D]uring the late antebellum period, some Southerners became increasingly discouraged about slavery’s future in the Union because of the filibusters’ constant setbacks; and on the eve of the war, northern memories of filibusters helped to stymie a compromise that might have averted the conflict. Had Americans never filibustered, the Union might have weathered the storm.”5","['the 1850s', 'the decade', 'the eve']",filibuster expedition proliferate dramatically 1850 robert preeminent authority filibustering estimate give time decade filibustering scheme planning execution stage true leader scheme seek like walker expand slavery new region caribbean mexico fair attribute movement “ slave power conspiracy ” direct single command end filibusterer best understand manifestation ceaseless expansionist quest new land new opportunity new source wealth antislavery activist understandably tend action walker transparent campaign spread slave institution south border robert suggest resurgence filibustering play key role kindle southern secessionist sentiment create republican resistance compromise eve civil war “ d]ur late antebellum period southerner increasingly discouraged slavery ’s future union filibusters’ constant setback eve war northern memory filibuster help stymie compromise avert conflict american filibuster union weather storm.”5,117,[1850],1850,1,1875,1900
282,"Although Democratic politicians tended to oppose the actions of the filibusters as an unwarranted intrusion on the federal power to make foreign policy, this did not mean that they renounced further expansionism. Indeed, the hunger of Democrats, especially Southern ones, for expansion continued to increase. In 1848 Democrat standard bearer Lewis Cass proclaimed, “We want almost unlimited power of expansion. That is our safety valve.”6 The return of the Democrats to the White House in 1853 saw new president Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire decry “any timid forebodings about expansion.” Pierce, a Mexican-American War veteran with a fondness for alcohol (his critics panned him as “the hero of many a bottle”), resumed efforts to acquire Cuba. In 1854, he instructed U.S. minister to Madrid Pierre Soulé to offer $130 million for Cuba and, if refused, to seek other ways “to detach the island from the Spanish dominion.” A French expatriate and a fervent supporter of the Lopez efforts to revolutionize Cuba, Soulé engaged in outrageous behavior at the court of Madrid, stifling whatever small chance he had for success. Suitably rebuffed, Soulé rendezvoused with minister to France John Y. Mason and minister to Great Britain James Buchanan in the Belgian city of Ostend. There they dispatched a secret report to Washington boldly calling for the seizing of Cuba and arguing that if Madrid continued to resist, “by every law, human and Divine, we shall be justified in wresting it from Spain.”7 When this confidential report (known as the Ostend Manifesto) was leaked to the press, it created a sensation. The boldness of the Cuban expansionist clique shocked Northern antislavery Democrats only slightly less than it did the European diplomatic corps. The ensuing contretemps forced President Pierce and Secretary of State William Marcy to repudiate the work of Soule, Mason, and Buchanan and, for the time being, give up on Cuban annexation schemes.","['1848', '1853', '1854']",democratic politician tend oppose action filibuster unwarranted intrusion federal power foreign policy mean renounce expansionism hunger democrat especially southern one expansion continue increase 1848 democrat standard bearer lewis cass proclaim “ want unlimited power expansion safety valve.”6 return democrats white house 1853 see new president franklin pierce new hampshire decry “ timid foreboding expansion ” pierce mexican war veteran fondness alcohol critic pan “ hero bottle ” resume effort acquire cuba 1854 instruct u.s minister madrid pierre soulé offer 130 million cuba refuse seek way “ detach island spanish dominion ” french expatriate fervent supporter lopez effort revolutionize cuba soulé engage outrageous behavior court madrid stifle small chance success suitably rebuff soulé rendezvous minister france john y. mason minister great britain james buchanan belgian city ostend dispatch secret report washington boldly call seizing cuba argue madrid continue resist “ law human divine shall justify wrest spain.”7 confidential report know ostend manifesto leak press create sensation boldness cuban expansionist clique shock northern antislavery democrat slightly european diplomatic corp ensue contretemp force president pierce secretary state william marcy repudiate work soule mason buchanan time cuban annexation scheme,185,"[1848, 1853, 1854]",1852,3,1875,1900
283,"Amid all these schemes of imperial conquest, both official and unofficial, the domestic expansionist consensus continued to erode and, with it, the bonds of union holding it all together. Although Narciso Lopez draped the mantle of freedom and republicanism over his insurrectionist movement, the desire to defend the institution of slavery from the attacks on it that seemed to be proliferating in the early 1850s best explains his actions. Although the newspaper-reading public thrilled to the idea of American expansion into Cuba, the political system at home found itself still trying to recover from the schism created by the conquests of the Mexican-American War. If not for the determined efforts of Henry Clay and other senior lawmakers to cobble together eight contradictory resolutions collectively known as the Compromise of 1850, the Union might have collapsed then and there. The historic compromise admitted California as a free state, with the remaining territories acquired from Mexico left open as to the question of slavery, to be determined at some later date by their inhabitants. Although the compromise admitted no new slave states, it did strengthen the federal Fugitive Slave Law, much to the outrage of abolitionists. As compromises are prone to do, the settlement of 1850 satisfied no one but did succeed in preventing a civil war at that time.","['the early 1850s', '1850', 'some later date']",amid scheme imperial conquest official unofficial domestic expansionist consensus continue erode bond union hold narciso lopez drape mantle freedom republicanism insurrectionist movement desire defend institution slavery attack proliferate early 1850 best explain action newspaper read public thrill idea expansion cuba political system home find try recover schism create conquest mexican war determined effort henry clay senior lawmaker cobble contradictory resolution collectively know compromise 1850 union collapse historic compromise admit california free state remain territory acquire mexico leave open question slavery determine later date inhabitant compromise admit new slave state strengthen federal fugitive slave law outrage abolitionist compromise prone settlement 1850 satisfy succeed prevent civil war time,106,"[1850, 1850]",1850,2,1875,1900

Acquiring Cuba either by purchase from Spain or via the agency of a private army headed by the likes of Lopez seemed out of the question.

285,"Against this backdrop of the increasing effort of Southern Democrats and their Northern “doughface” allies to push new annexationist plans even in the face of a breakdown of the expansionist consensus, it is no wonder that the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 shook the edifice of American union down to its foundation. The individual most responsible for the legislation was Stephen Douglas, a Young America devotee and senator from Illinois. One of the preeminent members of the new generation of political leaders, ambitious for higher office, and confident of his ability to navigate the turbulent waters of sectional differences, Douglas, as head of the Committee on Territories, in early January 1854 introduced legislation organizing the massive Nebraska territory (extending to the Canadian border) for future statehood. Previous efforts to do so had failed owing to disagreement over the status of slavery in the region. Douglas, desirous of securing a northern transcontinental railroad route and needing the votes of Southern senators to do so, presumed to solve the question of slavery in the territories by the device of popular sovereignty, leaving the slave question to be decided by the voters of the new state.","['1854', 'early January 1854']",backdrop increase effort southern democrat northern “ doughface ” ally push new annexationist plan face breakdown expansionist consensus wonder kansas nebraska act 1854 shake edifice union foundation individual responsible legislation stephen douglas young america devotee senator illinois preeminent member new generation political leader ambitious high office confident ability navigate turbulent water sectional difference douglas head committee territory early january 1854 introduce legislation organize massive nebraska territory extend canadian border future statehood previous effort fail owe disagreement status slavery region douglas desirous secure northern transcontinental railroad route need vote southern senator presume solve question slavery territory device popular sovereignty leave slave question decide voter new state,105,"[1854, 1854]",1854,2,1875,1900
286,"This schism played out violently in the newly created territory of Kansas, where efforts to establish a territorial government resulted in the creation of two constitutions: one based on the principle of freedom, the other on the principle of slavery. By 1856, the two sides had commenced a conflict of rapidly escalating violence. The rampages of John Brown and his sons were the most notorious but by no means the only examples of violent confrontation, as groups from the North and the South sent arms, money, and men to support their side in what marks the true beginning of the Civil War. If the shelling of Fort Sumter in 1861 marks the breakup of the American union, the violence in Kansas in 1856 signifies the collapse of the American nation and the expansionist consensus on which it was built.

Tolerance of that difference within a strong union had been the key to all the achievements since 1787.

However, this philosophy of limited government in domestic affairs did not inhibit his efforts to commit the national government to buying Cuba. In 1859 Senator John Slidell of Louisiana introduced the so-called $30 Million Bill, seeking an appropriation that would form the basis of a purchase offer for the island. The Senate debate on the matter that February attracted a great deal of attention, with press coverage of the issue rivaling that of the murder trial of Representative Daniel Sickles of New York, accused of killing his wife’s lover.

In the name of freedom and in the name of America, Republicans declared war on a Southern way of life built on bondage and inequality.

From there, slavery would end with the consent of Southerners themselves. In short, Republican plans to “reconstruct” the Southern wing of the edifice of Union have their origins in the 1850s, not the 1860s.

295,"Although he had only limited direct experience with slavery, Lincoln had long opposed it on moral grounds. His main objection to it, however, was rooted in his conception of the role of labor in society. The free-labor ideology that formed the founding principle of the Republican party also functioned as the cornerstone of Lincoln’s political sentiments. Efforts in the 1850s to preserve and expand slavery rekindled the political ambitions of the successful Illinois attorney insofar as they constituted a direct threat to the happiness and success of people like him, white men from humble backgrounds. Whatever ambivalence he held regarding the social and political equality of blacks, Lincoln staunchly affirmed the principle that workers of any color had a right to the fruits of their labor. Historians at times underestimate the intensity of the free-labor sentiments that formed the basis of Lincoln’s hostility to slavery. In his first annual message to Congress in December 1861, Lincoln reaffirmed this idea in terms that were a distillation of his views: “Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration.” Most importantly, Lincoln vehemently denied “there is any such thing as a free man fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer … Many independent men everywhere in these States a few years back in their lives were hired laborers…. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty…. Let them beware of surrendering a political power which they already possess, and which if surrendered will surely be used to close the doors of advancement against such as they, and fix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all of our liberty shall be lost.”11 Perhaps no single passage better sums up Lincoln’s staunch free-labor ideology or better explains why he saw slavery as a threat to it. Lincoln’s passionate attachment to the laboring classes bears some similarity to Jefferson’s ideas regarding yeoman farmers, as a sort of chosen people of God upon whose continued existence the survival of American liberty depended. Having no doubt that freedom was indivisible, Lincoln keenly understood that to take it away from one group of people was to invite its removal from another.","['the 1850s', 'annual', 'December 1861', 'a few years']",limit direct experience slavery lincoln long oppose moral ground main objection root conception role labor society free labor ideology form founding principle republican party function cornerstone lincoln ’s political sentiment effort 1850s preserve expand slavery rekindle political ambition successful illinois attorney insofar constitute direct threat happiness success people like white man humble background ambivalence hold social political equality black lincoln staunchly affirm principle worker color right fruit labor historian time underestimate intensity free labor sentiment form basis lincoln ’s hostility slavery annual message congress december 1861 lincoln reaffirm idea term distillation view “ labor prior independent capital capital fruit labor exist labor exist labor superior capital deserve high consideration ” importantly lincoln vehemently deny “ thing free man fix life condition hire laborer … independent man state year life hire laborer … man live worthy trust toil poverty … let beware surrender political power possess surrender surely close door advancement fix new disability burden till liberty shall lost.”11 single passage better sum lincoln ’s staunch free labor ideology better explain see slavery threat lincoln ’s passionate attachment laboring class bear similarity jefferson ’s idea yeoman farmer sort choose people god continue existence survival liberty depend have doubt freedom indivisible lincoln keenly understand away group people invite removal,207,"[1850, 1861]",1856,2,1875,1900

Our republican robe is soiled, and trailed in the dust. Let us repurify it. Let us turn and wash it white, in the spirit, if not the blood, of the Revolution.”12 The reconstruction of American liberty was essential if the United States was to recover its place as the world’s beacon of freedom. His public remarks for the remainder of his life rested on the bedrock assumption that slavery was an enormous wrong in need of being put right: “I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I can not remember a time when I did not so think and feel.”13 To an audience in Chicago in 1859, he observed, “Never forget that we have before us this whole matter of right and wrong of slavery in this Union, though the immediate question is as to its spreading out into new Territories and States.”14","['October 1854', '1859']",october 1854 speech peoria illinois lincoln hint future hold characterize slavery “ monstrous injustice ” “ deprive republican example influence world – enable enemy free institution plausibility taunt hypocrite … republican robe soil trail dust let repurify let turn wash white spirit blood revolution.”12 reconstruction liberty essential united state recover place world ’s beacon freedom public remark remainder life rest bedrock assumption slavery enormous wrong need right “ naturally anti slavery slavery wrong wrong remember time think feel.”13 audience chicago 1859 observe “ forget matter right wrong slavery union immediate question spread new territory states.”14,95,"[1854, 1859]",1856,2,1875,1900

His father had arrived in Kentucky in 1782 from Virginia and had found the challenges of farming a small plot without slaves made harder by the immense confusions created by the shoddy recording of deeds. Indeed, Lincoln’s father lost three farms to bad claims and more generally suffered the ignominy of being a poor white farmer in a county where property in slaves constituted the only real visible sign of wealth and prestige. Crossing the Ohio River in 1816 when Abe was seven, the Lincolns found clear and secure land titles and no slave labor in the newly created state of Indiana (both thanks to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787) and an absence of hostile Indians, thanks to the campaigns of the War of 1812. Lincoln’s visceral dislike of slavery was combined with his firsthand understanding of how the institution tainted everything in the societies where it existed.

The antislavery faction began to fear slavery’s march not only into new lands to the west and to the south but also into the northern states as well. Although the banning of slavery by individual northern states seemed to preclude this possibility, the Dred Scott case of 1857, which held that the status of a slave did not change by bringing him or her into a free state and that masters had the same right to bring their slaves into free states as they did any other piece of personal property, aroused this fear in the minds of many Republicans, Lincoln included. What was to stop a slave owner from bringing a thousand slaves into a free state? The imposition in 1836 of the gag rule banning congressional debate on slavery was seen in retrospect as the first in a long line of steps by the South to infringe on the freedom of the North.

Although the spread of the institution had long been opposed, there now emerged a sizable minority committed to ending it, one way or another. William Seward, the leader of the Republican party, attracted headlines in 1858 when he announced the existence of “an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, and it means that the United States must and will, sooner or later, become either entirely a slave-holding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation.” Opponents of slavery, in language reminiscent of the 1840s, began to echo the outlook of the “All of Mexico” faction, arguing that the people of the South were in need of civilizational regeneration in much the same way as the Mexicans had been. The New York Tribune made this point: “It is only by the abolition of slavery and the cessation of the slaveholding and the slave trade, followed by an emigration of Northern capitalists, manufacturers, and merchants, that the practical regeneration of Virginia can be effected.”15","['the late 1850s', '1858', 'the 1840s']",late 1850 northerner republican see slave south country unfit inclusion great temple liberty presume union spread institution long oppose emerge sizable minority commit end way william seward leader republican party attract headline 1858 announce existence irrepressible conflict oppose enduring force mean united state sooner later entirely slave hold nation entirely free labor nation ” opponent slavery language reminiscent 1840s begin echo outlook “ mexico ” faction argue people south need civilizational regeneration way mexican new york tribune point abolition slavery cessation slaveholding slave trade follow emigration northern capitalist manufacturer merchant practical regeneration virginia effected.”15,94,"[1850, 1858, 1840]",1849,3,1850,1850
300,"The seriousness of the impending crisis radically escalated as a result of John Brown’s abortive attempt in October 1859 to seize the federal armory in Harper’s Ferry, Virginia, arm slaves, and launch an uprising in Virginia. Brown’s fanaticism and his flawed plan of revolt doomed his efforts to failure. However, the sheer audacity of Brown’s actions and his near-canonization by some Northerners in the aftermath of his trial and execution rattled Southern nerves. How could anyone, of any view on slavery, countenance a replay of Nat Turner’s campaign of terror and vengeance? In December 1859, Buchanan decried the “sad and bloody occurrences at Harper’s Ferry” as yet another provocation against the interests of the South, more “symptoms of an incurable disease in the public mind, which may break out in still more dangerous outrages and terminate at last in an open war by the North to abolish slavery in the South.” He reiterated his view and that of others that the net result of all abolitionist and antislavery agitation had been to threaten “the peace and domestic fireside” of the fifteen slave states, shaking the mothers of “this extensive region,” who might “not be able to rest at night without suffering dreadful apprehensions of what may be their own fate and that of their children before morning.”16","['October 1859', 'December 1859']",seriousness impending crisis radically escalate result john brown ’s abortive attempt october 1859 seize federal armory harper ’s ferry virginia arm slave launch uprising virginia brown ’s fanaticism flawed plan revolt doom effort failure sheer audacity brown ’s action near canonization northerner aftermath trial execution rattle southern nerve view slavery countenance replay nat turner ’s campaign terror vengeance december 1859 buchanan decry “ sad bloody occurrence harper ’s ferry ” provocation interest south “ symptom incurable disease public mind break dangerous outrage terminate open war north abolish slavery south reiterate view net result abolitionist antislavery agitation threaten “ peace domestic fireside ” slave state shake mother extensive region ” “ able rest night suffer dreadful apprehension fate child morning.”16,119,"[1859, 1859]",1859,2,1875,1900

Although Northern efforts to exclude slavery from the territories and the refusal of some northern states to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act provoked controversy, Buchanan claimed that “the immediate peril” stemmed from “the incessant and violent agitation of the slavery question throughout the North for the last quarter century,” an action that had “produced its malign influence on the slaves and inspired them with vague notions of freedom. Hence a sense of security no longer exists around the family altar. This feeling of peace at home has given place to apprehensions of servile insurrections.” In the face of such fears, “Self-preservation … the first law of nature” would overrule all the practical advantages of union and prompt secession. Buchanan practically begged Northerners to let Southerners handle the slave question in their own way. “As sovereign States, they, and they alone, are responsible before God and the world for the slavery existing among them.” Northerners had no more right to interfere with it, Buchanan claimed, “than with similar institutions in Russia or in Brazil.”19","['December 1860', 'the last quarter century']",buchanan repeat plaintive appeal union message congress december 1860 country “ eminently prosperous ” disunion loom northern effort exclude slavery territory refusal northern state enforce fugitive slave act provoke controversy buchanan claim immediate peril ” stem “ incessant violent agitation slavery question north quarter century ” action “ produce malign influence slave inspire vague notion freedom sense security longer exist family altar feeling peace home give place apprehension servile insurrection ” face fear “ self preservation … law nature ” overrule practical advantage union prompt secession buchanan practically beg northerner let southerner handle slave question way “ sovereign state responsible god world slavery exist ” northerner right interfere buchanan claim “ similar institution russia brazil.”19,115,[1860],1860,1,1875,1900

Like Polk before him, Lincoln was a dark horse candidate whose chief attribute was as everyone’s second choice. A one-term congressional representative and defeated senatorial aspirant, Lincoln seemed ill prepared for the task before him.

From young adulthood he had adhered to what he called “the Doctrine of Necessity,” the belief that “the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest, by some power over which the mind itself has no control.”21He also seems to have been motivated by a conviction that he was destined to play a reconstructive role in U.S. history. In an 1838 address titled “The Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions” delivered to the Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Lincoln speculated on the meaningful part his generation might have to play in the ongoing creation of American nationality: “The question then is, can that gratification be found in supporting and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others? Most certainly, it cannot … Towering genius disdains a beaten path…. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and if possible will have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen.

304,"Lincoln is a singular phenomenon in U.S. history, a leader of unparalleled moral insight and rhetorical power. As early as 1820, John Quincy Adams had longed for “but one man” who “could arise with the genius capable of comprehending, a heart capable of supporting, and an utterance capable of communicating those eternal truths” regarding slavery, “to lay bare in all its nakedness that outrage upon the goodness of God” that the institution symbolized. Such a man, Adams asserted, “would perform the duties of an angel upon earth!”23 In 1856, Walt Whitman had mused, “I would be much pleased to see some heroic, shrewd, fully-informed, healthy-bodied, middle-aged, beard-faced American blacksmith or boatman come down from the West across the Alleghenies, and walk into the Presidency, dressed in a clean suit of working attire, and with the tan all over his face, breast, and arms; I would certainly vote for that sort of man … before any other candidate.”24 Now that man had emerged in the person of Lincoln, a mountaintop visionary with the political genius to act in the world. Lincoln sought a legal, constitutional, and nonviolent resolution to slavery if possible, but above all he sought a resolution. Until now, antislavery advocates had always backed down in the face of Southern threats or bullying. In Lincoln, they now had a candidate who would not back down under any circumstances.","['1820', '1856', 'now']",lincoln singular phenomenon u.s history leader unparalleled moral insight rhetorical power early 1820 john quincy adams long “ man ” “ arise genius capable comprehend heart capable support utterance capable communicate eternal truth ” slavery “ lay bare nakedness outrage goodness god institution symbolize man adam assert perform duty angel earth!”23 1856 walt whitman muse “ pleased heroic shrewd fully inform healthy bodied middle aged beard face blacksmith boatman come west allegheny walk presidency dress clean suit work attire tan face breast arm certainly vote sort man … candidate.”24 man emerge person lincoln mountaintop visionary political genius act world lincoln seek legal constitutional nonviolent resolution slavery possible seek resolution antislavery advocate back face southern threat bully lincoln candidate circumstance,119,"[1820, 1856]",1838,2,1850,1850
305,"Lincoln’s “House Divided” speech, made during his debates with Stephen Douglas in 1858, is further evidence of his single-minded determination to confront slavery in the temple of Union no matter the cost. The ringing phrase, “a house divided against itself cannot stand” seemed to leave little room for compromise. Yet it is by no means clear that Lincoln, Seward, and other Republicans who adhered to this view were correct. Most Southerners appeared willing to extend the status quo of part-free, part-slave indefinitely, if only because it was part of the original constitutional compact. It was the Republicans, and the abolitionist and antislavery tendency that they represented, that could not imagine such a future.

306,"Notwithstanding his supposed moderation vis-à-vis the abolitionists or the so-called Black Republicans, Lincoln’s candidacy took direct aim at the Southern way of life. If his rhetorical bobbing and weaving on the stump at times tended to disguise this fact, the Cooper Union speech of 1860 removed all doubt as to the intensity of his convictions. In that address – noted both then and since as one of his most significant – Lincoln picked up on ideas first developed by zealous antislavery advocate Salmon P. Chase. In a tour de force that constituted his introduction to the New York political scene, Lincoln assumed the guises of constitutional scholar, skilled attorney, and messianic leader in demonstrating that the Framers of the Constitution did not intend to sanction slavery in any area subject to the jurisdiction of the central government, that is, anywhere outside the limits of the states, either on land or sea. In this address, he characterized slavery as a local, not a national, institution, with no long-term claim to either legitimacy or security. Lincoln condemned efforts to quiet the rising antislavery agitation and reaffirmed the morality of his side: “Let us have faith that might makes right, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.”25 This bold rhetoric effectively declaring war on slavery inspired Republicans and their allies as much as it terrified the South.","['1860', '–']",notwithstanding suppose moderation vis à vis abolitionist call black republican lincoln ’s candidacy take direct aim southern way life rhetorical bobbing weave stump time tend disguise fact cooper union speech 1860 remove doubt intensity conviction address – note significant – lincoln pick idea develop zealous antislavery advocate salmon p. chase tour de force constitute introduction new york political scene lincoln assume guise constitutional scholar skilled attorney messianic leader demonstrate framer constitution intend sanction slavery area subject jurisdiction central government outside limit state land sea address characterize slavery local national institution long term claim legitimacy security lincoln condemn effort quiet rise antislavery agitation reaffirm morality “ let faith make right faith let end dare duty understand it.”25 bold rhetoric effectively declare war slavery inspire republican ally terrify south,127,[1860],1860,1,1875,1900
307,"The dual elections of the 1860 presidential campaign signified the political dissolution of the Union. Heretofore, political party loyalties had crossed sectional boundaries. Now the widening chasm over slavery meant that Democratic nominee Stephen Douglas, a man with a long record of successfully straddling the sectional divide, received minimal support in the southern states. This failure of the political system any longer to contain the slave question followed the failure of the judiciary to do so, as symbolized in the Dred Scott decision of 1857. No inherent flaw or human shortcoming explains the failure of the institutions binding the Union together.

308,"The secession crisis cast in high relief the two distinct and incompatible versions of union existing at that time. One version, centered in the southern states but by no means confined only to them, saw the Union as a consensual community of states, loosely bound together, in which one’s primary loyalty remained to one’s state. A second version, articulated by Lincoln and others, framed the Union as prior to and above the states, a permanent political entity in which the whole constituted more than the sum of its parts.1 This division dated back to the ambiguous representations propagated during the ratification debates of the Constitution, and it had never been fully addressed or resolved. It might not have needed to be resolved but for the massive chasm that had opened over slavery. Yet the chasm that had opened brought to the surface the fundamental dispute over the very nature of the Union. In this respect, both sides plausibly saw themselves as inheritors of the revolutionary tradition. The key difference was that the emerging Confederate ideology, while claiming the revolutionary heritage as its own, explicitly rejected the promise in the Declaration of Independence of universal human equality in favor of an edifice dedicated to racial inequality, in which the white person’s freedom was made real by the black person’s bondage. Newly installed Confederate vice-president Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia, a moderate who almost until the last minute opposed secession, evidenced this view in February 1861 when he declared the Confederacy’s “corner-stone rests upon the great truth that the negro is not the equal of the white man; that slavery – subordination to the superior race – is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.”2","['February 1861', '–']",secession crisis cast high relief distinct incompatible version union exist time version center southern state mean confine see union consensual community state loosely bind ’s primary loyalty remain ’s state second version articulate lincoln frame union prior state permanent political entity constitute sum parts.1 division date ambiguous representation propagate ratification debate constitution fully address resolve need resolve massive chasm open slavery chasm open bring surface fundamental dispute nature union respect side plausibly see inheritor revolutionary tradition key difference emerge confederate ideology claim revolutionary heritage explicitly reject promise declaration independence universal human equality favor edifice dedicate racial inequality white person ’s freedom real black person ’s bondage newly instal confederate vice president alexander h. stephens georgia moderate minute opposed secession evidence view february 1861 declare confederacy ’s “ corner stone rest great truth negro equal white man slavery – subordination superior race – natural normal condition new government history world base great physical philosophical moral truth.”2,155,[1861],1861,1,1875,1900
309,"Some historians have since characterized as slightly absurd Seward’s desperate attempt to save the Union by provoking a foreign war. This view underestimates the power of warfare as a national cultural bonding agent. Seward’s idea, though fraught with risks, may have represented the best chance for averting a split in 1861. A vigorous assertion of the Monroe Doctrine in the name of American greatness no doubt would have made at least some border state secessionists reconsider, especially if it could be shown that the intervention might benefit the South and slavery in some demonstrable way.5 Lincoln, however, had the enemy he wanted. Although the panicky actions of Seward and other prominent Republicans during this time may have given secessionists the impression that their threats and bluster once again might work to compel the antislavery forces to back down, they could not have imagined the president-elect’s implacable resolve to stay the course no matter the cost. This put Lincoln one move ahead of his Southern adversaries during these critical moments. He did not get elected to compromise. His seeming passivity at this crucial time was calculated to allow the confrontation that he saw as inevitable to begin. As he wrote to his old political colleague Lyman Trumbull in an often-quoted line, “The tug has come, & better now, than anytime hereafter.” He later bid farewell to his loyal supporters in Springfield by acknowledging that he felt a sense of responsibility “greater than Washington,” a clear indicator of the magnitude of the challenge he thought himself to be facing.6",['1861'],historian characterize slightly absurd seward ’s desperate attempt save union provoke foreign war view underestimate power warfare national cultural bonding agent seward ’s idea fraught risk represent good chance avert split 1861 vigorous assertion monroe doctrine greatness doubt border state secessionist reconsider especially show intervention benefit south slavery demonstrable way.5 lincoln enemy want panicky action seward prominent republican time give secessionist impression threat bluster work compel antislavery force imagine president elect ’s implacable resolve stay course matter cost lincoln ahead southern adversary critical moment elect compromise passivity crucial time calculate allow confrontation see inevitable begin write old political colleague lyman trumbull quote line “ tug come good anytime later bid farewell loyal supporter springfield acknowledge feel sense responsibility “ great washington ” clear indicator magnitude challenge think facing.6,128,[1861],1861,1,1875,1900
310,"As the secession crisis worsened, key members of Congress worked to construct a compromise that could stave off disunion, at least temporarily. In early December a special Senate Committee of Thirteen – including Seward, Douglas, Benjamin Wade, and Jefferson Davis – introduced the most famous of these plans, named for Senator John Crittenden of Kentucky. It consisted of six constitutional amendments effectively barring the national government from interfering with slavery in any way, including banning abolition in the District of Columbia or on any federal property. It also prevented federal interference in the interstate slave trade and resurrected and extended the Missouri Compromise Line to the Pacific Ocean, designating as future slave states any territories south of that line as well as any territories acquired in the future. Stephen A. Douglas added to this plan restrictions prohibiting states from extending the franchise to free blacks and allocating federal aid to any state seeking to colonize its free black populations. Most onerously, Douglas proposed to make public criticism of slavery, either verbal or written, illegal. The Crittenden-Douglas “compromise” amounted to an utter capitulation to the slave oligarchy and a de facto nullification of the presidential election of 1860 by making unconstitutional the main policy principle of the winning candidate.","['early December', 'Thirteen –', '1860']",secession crisis worsen key member congress work construct compromise stave disunion temporarily early december special senate committee thirteen – include seward douglas benjamin wade jefferson davis – introduce famous plan name senator john crittenden kentucky consist constitutional amendment effectively bar national government interfere slavery way include ban abolition district columbia federal property prevent federal interference interstate slave trade resurrect extend missouri compromise line pacific ocean designate future slave state territory south line territory acquire future stephen a. douglas add plan restriction prohibit state extend franchise free black allocate federal aid state seek colonize free black population onerously douglas propose public criticism slavery verbal write illegal crittenden douglas “ compromise ” amount utter capitulation slave oligarchy de facto nullification presidential election 1860 make unconstitutional main policy principle win candidate,128,[1860],1860,1,1875,1900
311,"William Seward, while not publicly endorsing the Crittenden plan, privately praised it and offered his own suggestions for staving off disunion, including a constitutional amendment denying Congress any power over slavery in the states. At this crucial moment, Seward the firebrand, who had pronounced the free labor–slave labor controversy an “irrepressible conflict” in 1858, shied away from confrontation over slavery and sought a means to repress it one more time in the name of preserving the Union. Yet Lincoln, with the support of most Republicans, rejected any concessions implying that slavery was a national institution. At least some Republicans had judged war preferable to capitulation. Rep. Sydney Edgerton of Ohio saw an opportunity in the looming crisis: “The standard of revolt will be the signal of emancipation.”7 Such comments revealed the degree to which the views of the abolitionists had, over several decades, migrated into the mainstream. As early as 1840, some of them had called for “no Union with slaveholders.” From that point, it was easy to conclude, as did the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in 1844, that “the dissolution of the Union is the dissolution of slavery.”8Some secessionists also understood the potentially revolutionary effect a war might have on the institution. Even as he reluctantly supported his state in joining the Confederacy, former North Carolina senator and secretary of the navy George E. Badger predicted that secession would be “the death knell of slavery.”9","['1858', 'several decades', 'As early as 1840', '1844']",william seward publicly endorse crittenden plan privately praise offer suggestion stave disunion include constitutional amendment deny congress power slavery state crucial moment seward firebrand pronounce free labor – slave labor controversy “ irrepressible conflict ” 1858 shy away confrontation slavery seek means repress time preserve union lincoln support republican reject concession imply slavery national institution republican judge war preferable capitulation rep sydney edgerton ohio see opportunity loom crisis “ standard revolt signal emancipation.”7 comment reveal degree view abolitionist decade migrate mainstream early 1840 call “ union slaveholder ” point easy conclude massachusetts anti slavery society 1844 “ dissolution union dissolution slavery.”8some secessionist understand potentially revolutionary effect war institution reluctantly support state join confederacy north carolina senator secretary navy george e. badger predict secession “ death knell slavery.”9,127,"[1858, 1840, 1844]",1847,3,1850,1850

Four days later, he issued another proclamation ordering the navy to blockade the entrances to ports of the rebellious states, an act of war under international law that belied the fiction that the conflict was a police action. On April 27, he called for another 80,000 officers, soldiers, and sailors to be enlisted in the Union forces.

313,"Although the administration’s official line cast the war as an internal rebellion that denied the autonomy of the Confederacy, in practice Lincoln conducted the struggle as if he were at war with a foreign state. To a considerable degree, it was a foreign war. The Confederates had declared their independence, formed a union and a government, and were rapidly building a nation. In many respects, secession made real the de facto dual unions of the 1850s. The regional nature of the separation lent a binational aspect to the strife in a manner lacking in many civil wars in which both sides occupy the same political space. And while historians may differ as to what degree the North and the South existed as different countries by 1860, it is clear that Lincoln and the Republicans considered that the case, and acted accordingly.","['1850s', '1860']",administration ’s official line cast war internal rebellion deny autonomy confederacy practice lincoln conduct struggle war foreign state considerable degree foreign war confederate declare independence form union government rapidly build nation respect secession real de facto dual union 1850 regional nature separation lend binational aspect strife manner lack civil war side occupy political space historian differ degree north south exist different country 1860 clear lincoln republicans consider case act accordingly,70,"[1850, 1860]",1855,2,1875,1900

315,"The assault on the Confederacy, ostensibly a police action in the name of defending federal property, represented an unprecedented military and logistical challenge. It seemed an impossible task. The Confederacy occupied an extensive territory peopled by nine million whites, many of whom were armed and most of whom could be relied on to defend their land and their homes with great tenacity, if only in the name of repelling a foreign invasion. It was difficult to imagine the North being able to sustain popular support for a war to keep a resistant populace in the Union. However, the recent campaign against Mexico, in which a coordinated land and sea assault had resulted in the conquest of a nation roughly the same geographic size and population as the Confederacy, made the task more plausible. Northern factories were significantly more productive in 1861 than they had been in the 1840s, and an integrated national rail network now encompassed most of the northern states. Also important, the northern states had seen a 41 percent increase in population during the 1850s as compared to a 27 percent rise in the South. States such as Wisconsin and Minnesota, which had been minimally occupied in 1850, now had large and growing populations capable of making significant contributions to a national army.

316,"The European diplomatic front loomed only slightly less important than the Southern battlefront. As was the case in the War of Independence, Southern hopes for victory hinged on gaining the support of a major European power that could provide it with military supplies, money, and, ideally, troops. Some form of European intervention seemed inevitable at the outset of the conflict. Great Britain, France, and Spain each had geopolitical and ideological reasons to welcome the breakup of the United States: Such an outcome would check the rising economic and military power of the upstart New World state as well as cast doubt on the durability of a republican system of government. From the time of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Europeans had anticipated the breakup of the Union. Formal diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy appeared unavoidable, and more active support down the road seemed likely. “I cannot but feel,” wrote U.S. minister to France William L. Dayton, “that all these governments are disposed to take an advantage of the present distracted condition of the United States.”20",['1783'],european diplomatic loom slightly important southern battlefront case war independence southern hope victory hinge gain support major european power provide military supply money ideally troop form european intervention inevitable outset conflict great britain france spain geopolitical ideological reason welcome breakup united state outcome check rise economic military power upstart new world state cast doubt durability republican system government time treaty paris 1783 europeans anticipate breakup union formal diplomatic recognition confederacy appear unavoidable active support road likely “ feel ” write u.s minister france william l. dayton “ government dispose advantage present distracted condition united states.”20,95,[1783],1783,1,1800,1800
317,"Lincoln and Seward took a tough line to head off the catastrophic prospect of European intervention. Simultaneous threats to the Union from internal and external foes had been the greatest fear of American leaders from the time of independence, and the administration unambiguously signaled that any foreign interference (even in the form of mediation) would not be tolerated. Ministers Charles Francis Adams in London and Dayton in Paris informed their host governments that support for the Confederate cause would result in a war with what remained of the United States. With an audacity as great or greater than that of Polk when he simultaneously threatened war against Britain and Mexico, Lincoln evinced a steely determination to confront any nation that intervened in the struggle no matter how overextended federal forces might be, thereby letting the Europeans know that their efforts to aid the Confederacy would come at a steep cost. For Great Britain, that cost might include Canada, ever hostage to an American invasion. This alone proved sufficient to stay London’s hand. Lincoln made it clear he would take the Union down in flames rather than meekly acquiesce in European meddling in what he defined, in this context at least, as an internal quarrel. The United States, though in no position to contemplate another war while preoccupied with the South, staved off foreign intervention by its previously demonstrated willingness to take on its enemies no matter how difficult the circumstances. The nation’s well-established reputation for truculence gave pause to the Confederacy’s possible allies. Neither Lincoln nor Seward publicly uttered the term “Monroe Doctrine” during their time in office together, but their determined efforts to resist European interference in the Civil War contributed to its elevation to a type of Holy Writ. In the 1860s, as Jay Sexton observes, the Monroe Doctrine “became a nationalist symbol, a permanent feature of the political and diplomatic landscape.”21",['the 1860s'],lincoln seward take tough line head catastrophic prospect european intervention simultaneous threat union internal external foe great fear leader time independence administration unambiguously signal foreign interference form mediation tolerate minister charles francis adams london dayton paris inform host government support confederate because result war remain united state audacity great great polk simultaneously threaten war britain mexico lincoln evince steely determination confront nation intervene struggle matter overextended federal force let europeans know effort aid confederacy come steep cost great britain cost include canada hostage invasion prove sufficient stay london ’s hand lincoln clear union flame meekly acquiesce european meddling define context internal quarrel united state position contemplate war preoccupy south stave foreign intervention previously demonstrate willingness enemy matter difficult circumstance nation ’s establish reputation truculence give pause confederacy ’s possible ally lincoln seward publicly utter term “ monroe doctrine ” time office determined effort resist european interference civil war contribute elevation type holy writ 1860s jay sexton observe monroe doctrine nationalist symbol permanent feature political diplomatic landscape.”21,166,[1860],1860,1,1875,1900
318,"The Union blockade, a bold and provocative move designed to starve the South into submission, risked precipitating the greatly feared foreign intervention. Such action almost occurred in November 1861, when the USS San Jacinto, commanded by Charles Wilkes of U.S. Exploring Expedition fame, intercepted the British mail steamer Trent in international waters about three hundred miles east of Havana. Wilkes, twenty years older and no less irascible than when he had sailed the world, instead of taking the captured vessel to a prize court for adjudication, chose to arrest two Confederate envoys on board – John Y. Mason and John Slidell – who had been sent as ministers to London and Paris, respectively. Deeming the two diplomats “the embodiment of dispatches,” Wilkes declared them contraband and carried them off to be imprisoned. The British government and press expressed outraged at this latter-day example of impressment on the high seas, the violation that more than any other factor had caused the War of 1812. A third Anglo-American war loomed. Minister to the United States Lord Lyons worried that if war broke out, a desperate Lincoln might unleash a slave revolt: “British subjects may have their throats cut in a servile insurrection.”22 In January 1862, after several weeks of tense diplomacy, Seward, wisely ignoring the popular support Wilkes’s actions had generated in the North, agreed to release the two Confederates. This bit of confrontational diplomacy had the unexpected benefit of getting Great Britain to renounce once and for all the practice of impressment.","['November 1861', 'twenty years', 'January 1862', 'several weeks']",union blockade bold provocative design starve south submission risk precipitate greatly fear foreign intervention action occur november 1861 uss san jacinto command charles wilkes u.s explore expedition fame intercept british mail steamer trent international water mile east havana wilke year old irascible sail world instead take capture vessel prize court adjudication choose arrest confederate envoy board – john y. mason john slidell – send minister london paris respectively deem diplomat “ embodiment dispatch ” wilkes declare contraband carry imprison british government press express outraged day example impressment high sea violation factor cause war 1812 anglo war loom minister united state lord lyon worried war break desperate lincoln unleash slave revolt “ british subject throat cut servile insurrection.”22 january 1862 week tense diplomacy seward wisely ignore popular support wilkes ’s action generate north agree release confederate bit confrontational diplomacy unexpected benefit get great britain renounce practice impressment,146,"[1861, 1862]",1862,2,1875,1900
319,"The American war received a mixed response in Great Britain. Political conservatives tended to view with glee the imminent collapse of the experiment in republican government. The arrogant, upstart Americans were getting their comeuppance, and not a moment too soon. Manufacturers and merchants, as well, were generally inclined toward a Confederate victory that they expected would lead to an enhanced and freer cotton trade. Almost everyone hoped for a speedy end to the war, whose scale and horror shocked Europeans amid the relative peace of the mid-nineteenth century. At the same time the abolitionist tendency remained strong in Britain. All recognized that to aid the South in effect reinforced an institution outlawed in the British Empire in 1834. The working classes expressed strong solidarity with the Unionist cause, understanding their freedom to be in some sense connected to that of the slave. However, for the first year and a half of the war, British intervention of some sort seemed inescapable. Prime Minister Palmerston and Foreign Minister Lord John Russell waited for the right moment to act, for word of a Confederate victory comparable to that won by the Patriots at Saratoga in 1778. Precipitous action in the short run risked provoking a bloody spat with the United States that no one wanted.23","['the mid-nineteenth century', '1834', 'the first year and a half of the', '1778']",war receive mixed response great britain political conservative tend view glee imminent collapse experiment republican government arrogant upstart american get comeuppance moment soon manufacturer merchant generally incline confederate victory expect lead enhanced free cotton trade hop speedy end war scale horror shock europeans amid relative peace mid nineteenth century time abolitionist tendency remain strong britain recognize aid south effect reinforce institution outlaw british empire 1834 working class express strong solidarity unionist because understand freedom sense connect slave year half war british intervention sort inescapable prime minister palmerston foreign minister lord john russell wait right moment act word confederate victory comparable win patriot saratoga 1778 precipitous action short run risk provoke bloody spat united state wanted.23,115,"[1834, 1778]",1806,2,1825,1850
320,"The Confederacy’s incompetent diplomacy increased the Union’s chances for staving off European intervention. This was especially true as concerns the use of cotton as a tool of economic coercion. Cotton’s rising importance in the economy of the Western world led South Carolina senator James Hammond memorably to proclaim in 1856, “[N]o power on Earth dare make war on it … Cotton is king.” When the war began, the Confederate government believed it could force the British and French into helping its cause by threatening to embargo new shipments of the fiber, thereby crippling the textile industry, which was critical to prosperity and social peace in both countries. Accordingly, President Jefferson Davis declared an embargo on all cotton exports in an effort to coerce European support. It seems odd that the Confederate leadership placed so much confidence in this new attempt at economic coercion given what a disaster Jefferson’s embargo had been in forcing concessions from the Europeans. In spite of this history, the Confederate government vigorously enforced an embargo, going so far as to burn 2.5 million bales of cotton during the course of the struggle to keep it off world markets. The Confederates did not grasp that their heavy-handed efforts might have the effect of lessening support for their cause in Britain and France and, more importantly, prompting those nations to seek new sources of cotton from India and Egypt. In the short run, they did not even have to do that, because a bumper crop of cotton exports in 1860 supplied British mills with enough of the fiber to keep factories humming, at least for a while. Only in the latter part of 1862 did cotton shortages begin to occur in the textile mills of Lancashire. The crucial delay in making a cotton embargo effective combined with the blundering diplomacy of Slidell in Paris and Mason in London mostly negated the diplomatic advantages held by the Confederacy at the outset of the war.","['1856', '1860', '1862']",confederacy ’s incompetent diplomacy increase union ’s chance stave european intervention especially true concern use cotton tool economic coercion cotton ’s rise importance economy western world lead south carolina senator james hammond memorably proclaim 1856 “ n]o power earth dare war … cotton king ” war begin confederate government believe force british french help because threaten embargo new shipment fiber cripple textile industry critical prosperity social peace country accordingly president jefferson davis declare embargo cotton export effort coerce european support odd confederate leadership place confidence new attempt economic coercion give disaster jefferson ’s embargo force concession europeans spite history confederate government vigorously enforce embargo go far burn 2.5 million bale cotton course struggle world market confederate grasp heavy handed effort effect lessen support because britain france importantly prompt nation seek new source cotton india egypt short run bumper crop cotton export 1860 supply british mill fiber factory hum 1862 cotton shortage begin occur textile mill lancashire crucial delay make cotton embargo effective combine blunder diplomacy slidell paris mason london negate diplomatic advantage hold confederacy outset war,176,"[1856, 1860, 1862]",1859,3,1875,1900
321,"The prosecution of the war did not spell the compete cessation of the western expansionist process. With Southerners removed from Congress, a distinctly Northern scheme of expansion accelerated. Nevada, its vast silver reserves beckoning as a means to pay for the war, entered the Union in 1864 before it had attained the minimum population of sixty thousand called for in the Constitution. Lincoln explained, “The immense mineral resources of these territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have the tendency to improve the revenue of the government and diminish the burdens on the people.”26Colorado, also rich with mineral resources, entered the Union in 1864. The Homestead Act of 1862, long blocked by slave state opposition, opened the lands of the West to free occupation by American settlers. West of the Mississippi, the War on Native America continued but with far fewer federal troops, which were preoccupied with the Confederacy. This reduced military presence made the Sioux uprising in Minnesota in 1862 far more serious than otherwise might have been the case. In the so-called Dakota War, hundreds of Minnesotans lost their lives before that rebellion against U.S. authority was quashed and thirty-eight of its ringleaders publicly executed, the largest mass execution in American history.","['1864', '1864', '1862', '1862']",prosecution war spell compete cessation western expansionist process southerner remove congress distinctly northern scheme expansion accelerate nevada vast silver reserve beckon means pay war enter union 1864 attain minimum population thousand call constitution lincoln explain “ immense mineral resource territory ought develop rapidly possible step direction tendency improve revenue government diminish burden people.”26colorado rich mineral resource enter union 1864 homestead act 1862 long block slave state opposition open land west free occupation settler west mississippi war native america continue far few federal troop preoccupy confederacy reduce military presence sioux uprising minnesota 1862 far case call dakota war hundred minnesotan lose life rebellion u.s authority quash thirty ringleader publicly execute large mass execution history,113,"[1864, 1864, 1862, 1862]",1863,4,1875,1900
322,"As the struggle entered its second year, Lincoln continued to insist that the preservation of the Union comprised the sole purpose of the war. Beneath these assertions, he blazed a clearly discernible path to abolition. Although he had very publicly rescinded Fremont’s and Hunter’s emancipationist decrees both as a usurpation of presidential power and as damaging to his still tenuous hold on the border states, that was not the whole story. Rejecting the premature emancipation of the slaves as impolitic, he nonetheless embraced General Benjamin Butler’s policy of treating fleeing and captured slaves as a species of “contraband” of great material worth to the Confederacy and therefore subject to seizure. In 1862, the administration extended diplomatic recognition to Haiti and sent a minister there, an implicit boost to the idea of black freedom. In that same year, Lincoln made a pact with Great Britain to cooperate fully on the suppression of the African slave trade. Lincoln’s moves to abolish slavery in Washington, D.C., and the western territories, and his ultimately unsuccessful efforts to craft a compensation plan to end slavery in the border states, are underestimated in their importance. These actions generated tremendous support in the free black abolitionist community and further encouraged its sense that, whatever policy tack circumstances required him to take, in the end Lincoln was on the side of abolition. Frederick Douglass, himself at times skeptical of Lincoln’s political bobbing and weaving, ultimately affirmed, “A blind man can see where the President’s heart is.”27 Lincoln proved a master at saying different things to different constituencies in the name of holding his fragile coalition together, and yet his deepest commitment from the start of the crisis was to freedom. Of all the political players at that time, blacks grasped that commitment most acutely. Their widespread understanding of him as the Great Emancipator was both accurate and prescient.","['second year', '1862', 'that same year']",struggle enter second year lincoln continue insist preservation union comprise sole purpose war beneath assertion blaze clearly discernible path abolition publicly rescind fremont ’s hunter ’s emancipationist decree usurpation presidential power damage tenuous hold border state story reject premature emancipation slave impolitic nonetheless embrace general benjamin butler ’s policy treat fleeing capture slave species “ contraband ” great material worth confederacy subject seizure 1862 administration extend diplomatic recognition haiti send minister implicit boost idea black freedom year lincoln pact great britain cooperate fully suppression african slave trade lincoln ’s move abolish slavery washington d.c western territory ultimately unsuccessful effort craft compensation plan end slavery border state underestimate importance action generate tremendous support free black abolitionist community encourage sense policy tack circumstance require end lincoln abolition frederick douglass time skeptical lincoln ’s political bobbing weaving ultimately affirm “ blind man president ’s heart is.”27 lincoln prove master say different thing different constituency hold fragile coalition deep commitment start crisis freedom political player time black grasp commitment acutely widespread understanding great emancipator accurate prescient,172,[1862],1862,1,1875,1900
323,"Deeply committed in principle to freedom, in practice Lincoln wrestled with what that meant, both to himself and to American society as a whole. On the one hand, Lincoln would never have consented to any agreement with the South that did not put slavery back on a course to its ultimate extinction, and in that sense the war was never “a limited war with the limited goal of restoring the status quo antebellum,” as James McPherson recently has suggested.28 Even at the outset, Lincoln would not have agreed to a plan for reunion that did not codify the principle of nonextension, the original point of contention. In the first months of the conflict, he had not glimpsed what the status of freed blacks might be after the war. His own limited dealings with African Americans precluded him for a time from having strong opinions regarding their capacity for full civil equality. As the war progressed, so did Lincoln’s understanding of its implications. Beginning as a war for freedom disguised as a war for the Union, by its end the struggle had revealed itself to be a war for freedom, equality, and Union, chiefly as a result of the blood sacrifice made by the tens of thousands of freedmen serving in the Union armies and navies. Circumstances pushed the purpose of the war toward freedom. The abolitionist spring of 1862 saw members of this formerly despised community increasingly lauded as principled and farsighted critics of the now-palpable menace of the slave South. Even more important, tens of thousands of slaves now began to self-emancipate, fleeing to the Union lines, where their status as contraband mattered less than the fact that they had freed themselves from bondage. As newly liberated blacks began to clamor to be allowed to fight for the freedom of those left behind, Lincoln had both an opportunity and a dilemma.","['the first months', 'spring of 1862']",deeply committed principle freedom practice lincoln wrestle mean society hand lincoln consent agreement south slavery course ultimate extinction sense war “ limit war limited goal restore status quo antebellum ” james mcpherson recently suggested.28 outset lincoln agree plan reunion codify principle nonextension original point contention month conflict glimpse status free black war limited dealing african american preclude time have strong opinion capacity civil equality war progress lincoln ’s understanding implication begin war freedom disguise war union end struggle reveal war freedom equality union chiefly result blood sacrifice ten thousand freedman serve union army navy circumstance push purpose war freedom abolitionist spring 1862 see member despise community increasingly laud principled farsighted critic palpable menace slave south important ten thousand slave begin self emancipate flee union line status contraband matter fact free bondage newly liberate black begin clamor allow fight freedom leave lincoln opportunity dilemma,143,[1862],1862,1,1875,1900
324,"In July 1862, Lincoln announced his intention to begin to enlist black troops in the Union armies as a “military necessity,” hoping this most expedient of reasons would overshadow the objections (both at home and abroad) to the idea of racializing the war by arming free blacks. It proved to be one of the most important decisions he made as president, for the approximately 200,000 free blacks that did serve decisively tilted the balance of forces in the direction of the Union. The stories of long lines of black troops courageously engaging in desperate, no-quarter combat in the name of freedom, equality, and Union did much to make the idea of full black citizenship plausible in the eyes of at least some white Americans, Lincoln included. To Southerners, in contrast, Lincoln’s arming of the slaves constituted their worst nightmare come true: legions of armed blacks on the march against a slave-holding society. Lincoln himself seemed to understand the terror this held for white Southerners when he wrote to then-senator Andrew Johnson, “The bare sight of fifty thousand armed, and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi, would end the rebellion at once.”29 It did not turn out to be quite that easy, but there is no doubt that the fact and symbolism of black troops fighting for both freedom and union is one of the most compelling motifs of the struggle, making reenslavement after the war an impossibility.",['July 1862'],"july 1862 lincoln announce intention begin enlist black troop union army “ military necessity ” hop expedient reason overshadow objection home abroad idea racializ war arm free black prove important decision president approximately 200,000 free black serve decisively tilt balance force direction union story long line black troop courageously engage desperate quarter combat freedom equality union idea black citizenship plausible eye white american lincoln include southerner contrast lincoln ’s arming slave constitute bad nightmare come true legion armed black march slave hold society lincoln understand terror hold white southerner write senator andrew johnson “ bare sight thousand armed drill black soldier bank mississippi end rebellion once.”29 turn easy doubt fact symbolism black troop fight freedom union compelling motif struggle make reenslavement war impossibility",123,[1862],1862,1,1875,1900
325,"Having failed to work out a scheme of gradual, compensated abolition acceptable to the border states, by mid-1862 Lincoln had decided to use his emergency war powers under martial law to emancipate the slaves in the states in rebellion. Hoping to give maximum effect to his decree, he waited until Lee’s defeat at Antietam in September 1862 boosted the Union cause sufficiently so as not to give emancipation the appearance of a desperate act by the losing side. The Emancipation Proclamation functioned as a sort of second Declaration of Independence, an announcement to the world regarding the nature of the struggle as well as a redefinition of the purpose of the war for Northerners. The Emancipation Proclamation transformed the war from an effort to put slavery on a course to its ultimate extinction to something resembling a form of immediatism, at least in the rebellious states.","['mid-1862', 'September 1862']",have fail work scheme gradual compensated abolition acceptable border state mid-1862 lincoln decide use emergency war power martial law emancipate slave state rebellion hop maximum effect decree wait lee ’s defeat antietam september 1862 boost union because sufficiently emancipation appearance desperate act lose emancipation proclamation function sort second declaration independence announcement world nature struggle redefinition purpose war northerner emancipation proclamation transform war effort slavery course ultimate extinction resemble form immediatism rebellious state,72,"[1862, 1862]",1862,2,1875,1900
326,"Richard Hofstadter once characterized Lincoln’s movement toward emancipation as “a brilliant strategic retreat toward a policy of freedom.”31 If it was a retreat, it was to a position that, from the start, had been his ultimate goal. Lincoln’s genius as president inhered in his ability to lead a largely resistant American people to a place of freedom that was the logical consequence of their nationalist ideology. He did so by placing the present struggle in a larger historical context. In late 1862 he urged Congress to remember “The struggle of to-day is not altogether for to-day; it is for a vast future also. With a reliance on Providence all the more firm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task which events have devolved upon us.”32","['late 1862', 'to-day']",richard hofstadter characterize lincoln ’s movement emancipation “ brilliant strategic retreat policy freedom.”31 retreat position start ultimate goal lincoln ’s genius president inhere ability lead largely resistant people place freedom logical consequence nationalist ideology place present struggle large historical context late 1862 urge congress remember “ struggle day altogether day vast future reliance providence firm earnest let proceed great task event devolve us.”32,63,[1862],1862,1,1875,1900
327,"Once the war became a war for freedom and union, Northern armies assumed broad powers to seize or destroy any Southern property they came across. The time for a mutual reconciliation under a partially reconstructed Union had passed; now the Southern wing of the edifice of Union would be demolished and completely reconstructed upon a new plan. Howard Jones notes, “Lincoln appealed to universal principles of right and wrong and concluded that the destruction of the southern government and way of life was necessary for the betterment of the republic.”33 In his second annual message in December 1862, Lincoln put the issue squarely to the members of Congress: “The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present…. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country…. Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this Administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves…. In giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free…. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth.”34 These lines reflected the president’s increasing efforts to reframe the struggle as not only a war to save the Union but rather a war to advance the cause of human freedom everywhere. And even though it is by no means certain that the fate of republican government everywhere rested on the Union cause – the United States was, after all, not the only democratic society in the nineteenth-century world – it is clear that, thanks in no small measure to the president’s rhetoric, white Northerners began to perceive the struggle in larger, historic terms. Equally significant, Lincoln’s own spiritual convictions steadily deepened as the war progressed, as did his belief that the struggle he prosecuted with increasing fury comprised part of a divine plan whose ultimate form and outcome were unknowable.","['annual', 'December 1862', 'the nineteenth-century']",war war freedom union northern army assume broad power seize destroy southern property come time mutual reconciliation partially reconstruct union pass southern wing edifice union demolish completely reconstruct new plan howard jones note “ lincoln appeal universal principle right wrong conclude destruction southern government way life necessary betterment republic.”33 second annual message december 1862 lincoln issue squarely member congress “ dogma quiet past inadequate stormy present … case new think anew act anew disenthrall shall save country … fellow citizen escape history congress administration remember spite … give freedom slave assure freedom free … shall nobly save meanly lose good hope earth.”34 line reflect president ’s increase effort reframe struggle war save union war advance because human freedom mean certain fate republican government rest union because – united state democratic society nineteenth century world – clear thank small measure president ’s rhetoric white northerner begin perceive struggle large historic term equally significant lincoln ’s spiritual conviction steadily deepen war progress belief struggle prosecute increase fury comprise divine plan ultimate form outcome unknowable,172,[1862],1862,1,1875,1900
328," In April 1863, exactly midway through the war and three and a half months after signing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln began to contemplate the larger implications of his actions. He had unleashed a war for freedom, and yet at the same time, the Confederate claim to affirming the right to revolution in the Declaration of Independence still had not been decisively refuted. Observers on both sides of the Atlantic still wondered why the southern states could not opt to form a separate government of their own choosing, as guaranteed in the Declaration. Such sentiments were widespread in Europe, especially early in the war, when Lincoln refused to make slavery the central issue. As rhetorician in chief, Lincoln, too, found this objection hard to answer. In a moment of reflection, he drafted a resolution on executive stationery that he hoped would serve as an answer to these objections:","['April 1863', 'three and a half months']",april 1863 exactly midway war half month sign emancipation proclamation lincoln begin contemplate large implication action unleash war freedom time confederate claim affirm right revolution declaration independence decisively refute observer side atlantic wonder southern state opt form separate government choosing guarantee declaration sentiment widespread europe especially early war lincoln refuse slavery central issue rhetorician chief lincoln find objection hard answer moment reflection draft resolution executive stationery hop serve answer objection,70,[1863],1863,1,1875,1900
329,"As the ferocity of the war increased, so did Lincoln’s compassion for both sides, a function of his rising awareness that all concerned bore some responsibility for the horrible conflagration. In place of senseless slaughter for no discernible purpose, Lincoln offered a providentially ordained ritual of blood sacrifice and redemption in which neither side stood fully justified. A not especially religious man for most of his life, as the war went on Lincoln relied increasingly on a type of Old Testament Puritanism to justify the slaughter to a weary people. In March 1863, he issued a proclamation designating a national day of prayer and humiliation, casting “the awful calamity of civil war” as “but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins, to the needful end of our reformation as a people…. We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven … But we have forgotten God…. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God who made us.”40Along the same lines, that October the president by proclamation designated the third Thursday in November as “a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens,” a collective opportunity to repent for the nation’s sins and to pray for an end to the war “as soon as it may be consistent with the divine purposes.”","['March 1863', 'October', 'Thursday', 'November', 'thanksgiving']",ferocity war increase lincoln ’s compassion side function rise awareness concern bear responsibility horrible conflagration place senseless slaughter discernible purpose lincoln offer providentially ordain ritual blood sacrifice redemption stand fully justified especially religious man life war go lincoln rely increasingly type old testament puritanism justify slaughter weary people march 1863 issue proclamation designate national day prayer humiliation cast “ awful calamity civil war ” “ punishment inflict presumptuous sin needful end reformation people … recipient choice bounty heaven … forget god … intoxicate unbroken success self sufficient feel necessity redeem preserve grace proud pray god us.”40along line october president proclamation designate thursday november “ day thanksgiving praise beneficent father dwelleth heaven ” collective opportunity repent nation ’s sin pray end war “ soon consistent divine purpose,126,[1863],1863,1,1875,1900
330,"This enlarged spiritual outlook in the service of American nationalism informed Lincoln’s two greatest rhetorical victories: the Gettysburg Address, consecrating the battle cemetery there, and the second inaugural address in March 1865. In the tradition of previous landmark documents such as the Declaration of Independence, both operated to explain America to itself even as they explained America to the world.41 Unlike the Emancipation Proclamation, whose restrained language aimed to accomplish a specific task without provoking much thought, the Gettysburg Address and the second inaugural sought to generate support for the abstractions of freedom and popular government, to inspire the American people as to their future rather than inform them about their present. It was a rhetorical-political alchemy perhaps unrivaled in history and required only in a democracy in which the will of the people must be taken into account.

331,"Having transformed the war from a narrow struggle to restore the Union into a transcendent payment of a blood debt for a collective national sin, Lincoln essentially absolved both sides of responsibility for its cause and placed its origins and conclusion solely in the hands of God. Expanding his personal notion of the “doctrine of necessity” to the entire society, Lincoln suggested a radical way of conceiving of the struggle that resonated with a preexisting cultural Puritanism, even as he hedged all of his remarks with the conditional “if.” Although it is not often seen as such, the second inaugural address is perhaps best understood as the ultimate statement of American Manifest Destiny. Any Jacksonian Democrat of the 1840s could have endorsed its fundamental assumptions that Americans are a chosen people with a divine destiny. Yet Lincoln’s calls for charity and forgiveness amid the horrors of the war proved irresistible both at the time and since, seducing even those generally inclined to reject Old Testament explanations for human events.",['the 1840s'],have transform war narrow struggle restore union transcendent payment blood debt collective national sin lincoln essentially absolve side responsibility because place origin conclusion solely hand god expand personal notion “ doctrine necessity ” entire society lincoln suggest radical way conceive struggle resonate preexist cultural puritanism hedge remark conditional “ ” see second inaugural address best understand ultimate statement manifest destiny jacksonian democrat 1840s endorse fundamental assumption american choose people divine destiny lincoln ’s call charity forgiveness amid horror war prove irresistible time seduce generally inclined reject old testament explanation human event,91,[1840],1840,1,1850,1850

Even the once firmly held belief that the Civil War gave birth to the industrialized United States has been disproved. The annual growth rate of U.S. manufactures was 7.8 percent between 1840 and 1860, but 6 percent between 1870 and 1900. Between 1860 and 1870, the value added by manufacturing increased by only 2.3 percent annually, the lowest rate of increase in the nineteenth century. Some economists explain this surprisingly low rate by arguing that the roots of industrialized America stretched back well before the Civil War and by noting that the conflict itself was not the first modern war but one of the last major preindustrial clashes.1","['the 1860s', 'mid-1890s', 'between 1840 and 1860', 'between 1870 and 1900', 'Between 1860 and 1870', 'annually', 'the nineteenth century']",historic change course start cleanly 1860s jefferson polk example demonstrate incredible potential presidential power long theodore roosevelt ’s birth faith supply china ’s market depression ride american work date mid-1780 mid-1890 firmly hold belief civil war give birth industrialized united state disprove annual growth rate u.s manufacture 7.8 percent 1840 1860 6 percent 1870 1900 1860 1870 value add manufacture increase 2.3 percent annually low rate increase nineteenth century economist explain surprisingly low rate argue root industrialize america stretch civil war note conflict modern war major preindustrial clashes.1,88,"[1860, 1890]",1875,2,1900,1900
334,"That was one reason, no doubt, why later Americans so glorified this struggle waged by foot soldiers and men on horseback who fought at close quarters to protect a plot of earth they knew well. As Lincoln’s reflections at Gettysburg announced, and as Edmund Wilson’s Patriotic Gore a century later realized, a sense of self-sacrifice, moving in part (as Wilson noted) from Calvinist realism, added a new dimension to the already healthy sense of mission held by Americans. Few Civil War soldiers were quoted as saying they were willing to march into near-certain death at Antietam because they were just “doing their job.” The American belief in Calvinism and mission was not decades old but two centuries old when it motivated soldiers on 1860s battlefields or missionaries in 1890s China. If a difference appeared, it was, as Albert Weinberg has observed, that in 1776 Americans assumed the natural rights that blessed them were universal, whereas by the 1890s these rights were considered national – and even then limited largely to males and certain Caucasians. The Civil War officially ended the slavery of African Americans, but the Emancipation Proclamation was not a commitment as well to raise the former slaves to equality. The mission and the racism that characterized U.S. imperialism in 1900 thus had different emphases and objectives than before the Civil War, but their roots reached deep into American history.2","['close quarters', 'a century later', 'decades', 'two centuries old', '1860s', '1890s', '1776', 'the 1890s', '–', '1900']",reason doubt later american glorify struggle wag foot soldier man horseback fight close quarter protect plot earth know lincoln ’s reflection gettysburg announce edmund wilson ’s patriotic gore century later realize sense self sacrifice move wilson note calvinist realism add new dimension healthy sense mission hold american civil war soldier quote say willing march near certain death antietam “ job ” belief calvinism mission decade old century old motivate soldier 1860s battlefield missionary 1890s china difference appear albert weinberg observe 1776 american assume natural right bless universal 1890s right consider national – limit largely male certain caucasian civil war officially end slavery african american emancipation proclamation commitment raise slave equality mission racism characterize u.s imperialism 1900 different emphasis objective civil war root reach deep history.2,125,"[1860, 1890, 1776, 1890, 1900]",1863,5,1875,1900
335,"The 1860s marked the climax of a historic sense of mission and the emergence of a different kind of racism – a racism of neither slavery nor equality. The Civil War and the acts of Reconstruction also turned the United States into a nation-state. The phrase was no longer, as it had been before the 1860s, “the United States are,” but “the United States is.” The country’s unification occurred at the same time that Germany, Japan, Italy, and (with Alexander II’s reforms) even Russia were also evolving into modern nation-states that could serve as springboards to empire. Industrialization – or, in some early stages, the aspiration to industrialize – acted as a catalyst in the development of these nation-states.3","['The 1860s', '–', 'the 1860s', '–']",1860s mark climax historic sense mission emergence different kind racism – racism slavery equality civil war act reconstruction turn united state nation state phrase longer 1860s “ united state ” “ united state ” country ’s unification occur time germany japan italy alexander ii ’s reform russia evolve modern nation state serve springboard empire industrialization – early stage aspiration industrialize – act catalyst development nation states.3,66,"[1860, 1860]",1860,2,1875,1900
336,"In the United States, industrialization fed on the need to supply vast armies in the early 1860s. Those who could concentrate capital and set up spidery distribution systems could produce previously unimagined wealth in such businesses as meat processing and oil production. Many of the industries spawned by the Civil War helped shape U.S. foreign relations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1865, Phillip Armour already enjoyed a $2 million income from his meat-processing firm. By 1907 Armour and Company’s foreign sales manager watched over separate departments responsible for South America, Asia, Africa, Europe, England, Germany, and France. The first U.S. oil had been discovered in 1859; by 1865 this six-year-old industry already provided the sixth-largest U.S. export. In 1870, John D. Rockefeller and several partners named their refining operations (already the world’s biggest) Standard Oil. By 1883–5, Standard shipped 70 percent of its major product, kerosene, to Europe, and another 21.6 percent to Asia, where the Rockefellers were building the equivalent of their own diplomatic corps as they prepared for an epic battle with Russian oil.4","['the early 1860s', 'the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries', '1865', '1907', '1859', '1865', 'six-year-old', '1870']",united state industrialization feed need supply vast army early 1860s concentrate capital set spidery distribution system produce previously unimagined wealth business meat processing oil production industry spawn civil war help shape u.s foreign relation late nineteenth early twentieth century 1865 phillip armour enjoy 2 million income meat process firm 1907 armour company ’s foreign sale manager watch separate department responsible south america asia africa europe england germany france u.s oil discover 1859 1865 year old industry provide sixth large u.s export 1870 john d. rockefeller partner name refining operation world ’s big standard oil 1883–5 standard ship 70 percent major product kerosene europe 21.6 percent asia rockefeller build equivalent diplomatic corp prepare epic battle russian oil.4,116,"[1860, 1865, 1907, 1859, 1865, 1870]",1871,6,1875,1900
337,"Such industries and others also generated capital that was not only burgeoning (especially with the help of the federal government, which during the war issued several billion dollars more in paper than it took in through taxes) but also becoming concentrated. One New York newspaper observed that in the 1840s not more than twenty citizens had a worth of $1 million, but now in the 1860s New York alone had several hundred worth that amount, and some of them claimed $20 million. This nascent finance capitalism had been helped by the fleeing of foreign investment when the war broke out in 1861. The nation thus simultaneously multiplied and concentrated the capital resources necessary to compete later with the European cartels and government-sponsored firms that spread over the nonindustrialized world. Capital moves “in larger masses than formerly,” the New York Commercial and Financial Chronicle noted in 1866. “[Small firms cannot compete and are] absorbed into them…. It is one of the signs of the time and will probably exert no small influence over the future growth of our industrial and commercial enterprise.”5","['the 1840s', 'the 1860s', '1861', '1866']",industry generate capital burgeon especially help federal government war issue billion dollar paper take tax concentrated new york newspaper observe 1840s citizen worth 1 million 1860s new york worth claim 20 million nascent finance capitalism help fleeing foreign investment war break 1861 nation simultaneously multiply concentrate capital resource necessary compete later european cartel government sponsor firm spread nonindustrialized world capital move “ large mass ” new york commercial financial chronicle note 1866 “ small firm compete absorb … sign time probably exert small influence future growth industrial commercial enterprise.”5,89,"[1840, 1860, 1861, 1866]",1857,4,1875,1900
338,"This multiplication and concentration of wealth was not born of laissez-faire principles. The secession of the South in 1861 suddenly removed many members of Congress who had opposed systematic governmental help to the business sector. (They had good reasons for their opposition. With the expanding northern population giving that section control of Congress, Southerners knew that the help would flow especially to railroads and new manufacturing, both of which were relatively scarce in the slaveholding region.) As historian Charles Sellers phrased it, “Only on the battlefields of the Civil War did the progressive bourgeoisie of free-labor exploitation finally prevail over resistant farmers, workers, and the anachronistic [Southern] planter.” Thus the low tariffs of the post-1832 era were replaced in 1861 after passage of the Morrill Act, and over the next five years average ad valorem rates on dutiable imports shot up 250 percent. Such tariffs, combined with the military’s bottomless needs, opened the quickest path possible to creating a rich home market for industrialists. Nor did the new higher-tariff policy significantly change until the end of this era in 1913. Not content with merely creating a new protected market, Congress used more direct methods to unify and systematize it. In acts passed during 1862 and 1864, money, vast amounts of land, and rich timber and mineral rights were freely given to companies that would lay rail links. By 1869 the first transcontinental railroad existed. An industrialist spelled out one meaning for foreign affairs: “The drills and sheetings of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts and other manufactures of the United States may be transported to China in thirty days [instead of months]; and the teas and rich silks of China, in exchange, come back to New Orleans, to Charleston, … to Philadelphia, New York and Boston in thirty days more.” Replacing pre–Civil War Jacksonian democracy with Republican centralization radically enlarged the nation’s foreign opportunities.6","['1861', '1861', 'the next five years', 'the end of this era in 1913', '1862', '1864', '1869', 'thirty days', 'months', 'thirty days', '–']",multiplication concentration wealth bear laissez faire principle secession south 1861 suddenly remove member congress oppose systematic governmental help business sector good reason opposition expand northern population give section control congress southerner know help flow especially railroad new manufacturing relatively scarce slavehold region historian charles seller phrase “ battlefield civil war progressive bourgeoisie free labor exploitation finally prevail resistant farmer worker anachronistic southern planter ” low tariff post-1832 era replace 1861 passage morrill act year average ad valorem rate dutiable import shoot 250 percent tariff combine military ’s bottomless need open quick path possible create rich home market industrialist new high tariff policy significantly change end era 1913 content merely create new protect market congress direct method unify systematize act pass 1862 1864 money vast amount land rich timber mineral right freely give company lay rail link 1869 transcontinental railroad exist industrialist spell meaning foreign affair “ drill sheeting connecticut rhode island massachusetts manufacture united state transport china thirty day instead month tea rich silk china exchange come new orlean charleston … philadelphia new york boston thirty day ” replace pre – civil war jacksonian democracy republican centralization radically enlarge nation ’s foreign opportunities.6,193,"[1861, 1861, 1913, 1862, 1864, 1869]",1872,6,1875,1900
339,"Congress found a historic opportunity for creating wealth by passing a Homestead Act in 1862 that gave 160 acres of unoccupied land to anyone who would cultivate it for five years or pay $1.25 per acre within six months. The cash provision opened the riches of the western lands to wealthy speculators who seized good land and then sold it at profit. In 1864, Congress dealt with the growing labor shortage by passing the contract labor law, which allowed business agents to travel to Europe and bring back workers under contract. By 1865, the number of immigrants grew to twice that of 1861. Many were used to break strikes between 1864 and 1868, when the law expired. Unions had flourished in the early war years.7 When immigrants were not used to break strikes, blacks often were, and the resulting clashes (especially between African Americans and Irish) turned bloody. The racism and xenophobia shaped the ideology of following generations, including those who made U.S. foreign policy. Of equal importance, the clashes between capital and labor previewed later confrontations that, as they grew sharper during the post-1873 depression, led U.S. officials to search for foreign policies that might end the upheavals.","['1862', 'five years', 'six months', '1864', '1865', '1861', 'between 1864 and 1868', 'post-1873']",congress find historic opportunity create wealth pass homestead act 1862 give 160 acre unoccupied land cultivate year pay 1.25 acre month cash provision open rich western land wealthy speculator seize good land sell profit 1864 congress deal grow labor shortage pass contract labor law allow business agent travel europe bring worker contract 1865 number immigrant grow twice 1861 break strike 1864 1868 law expire union flourish early war years.7 immigrant break strike black result clash especially african american irish turn bloody racism xenophobia shape ideology follow generation include u.s foreign policy equal importance clash capital labor preview later confrontation grow sharp post-1873 depression lead u.s official search foreign policy end upheaval,111,"[1862, 1864, 1865, 1861, 1873]",1865,5,1875,1900
340,"Post–Civil War America remained a vast, unwieldy country of isolated, parochial communities, but the federal government had demonstrated its power to invade these areas and integrate them into an industrializing, railway-linked world that had global boundaries. When, for example, Congress moved in 1863 to try to systematize the banking system, it followed with an 1865 law that taxed state bank notes and created a more uniform national currency under Washington’s control. The growth of executive power more than kept pace with the legislatures’. By reasoning that the country faced an unprecedented emergency and then employing the Constitution’s provision that the president is commander in chief of the nation’s military, Abraham Lincoln raised and committed an army to oppose the South’s secession without even consulting Congress. Lincoln did ultimately ask Congress in mid-1861 to judge his actions, but never during the next four years did Congress successfully rein in his growing prerogative. In E. S. Corwin’s classic formulation, Lincoln’s success produced two results. One was that future presidents could directly deal, without undue concern for congressional or state objections, with conditions that the president believed presented actual or potential violence and, in his judgment, endangered the nation’s interest. A second result was that later presidents could more generally use, as Corwin phrased it, “Lincoln’s acts as if they supported the thesis of presidential autonomy – in other words, presidential autocracy – in all fields of presidential power.” Not the least of those fields would be foreign affairs, especially when the commander-in-chief authority over the nation’s military could serve as a rationale. Presidential power could not be separated easily into domestic and foreign compartments.8","['1863', '1865', 'mid-1861', 'the next four years']",post – civil war america remain vast unwieldy country isolated parochial community federal government demonstrate power invade area integrate industrializing railway link world global boundary example congress move 1863 try systematize banking system follow 1865 law tax state bank note create uniform national currency washington ’s control growth executive power keep pace legislatures’ reason country face unprecedented emergency employ constitution ’s provision president commander chief nation ’s military abraham lincoln raise commit army oppose south ’s secession consult congress lincoln ultimately ask congress mid-1861 judge action year congress successfully rein grow prerogative e. s. corwin ’s classic formulation lincoln ’s success produce result future president directly deal undue concern congressional state objection condition president believe present actual potential violence judgment endanger nation ’s interest second result later president generally use corwin phrase “ lincoln ’s act support thesis presidential autonomy – word presidential autocracy – field presidential power ” field foreign affair especially commander chief authority nation ’s military serve rationale presidential power separate easily domestic foreign compartments.8,168,"[1863, 1865, 1861]",1863,3,1875,1900
341,"The line from the 1860s to the foreign expansionism of the 1890s was not unbroken. Lincoln exerted unusual control over Congress and demonstrated how the executive’s broad powers could be stretched. Immediately after the war and his death, however, the Supreme Court moved to limit these powers by arguing that constitutional restraints worked “equally in war and in peace” and that to suspend those restraints even during an emergency such as the Civil War could lead “directly to anarchy or despotism.” Lincoln’s successor, Andrew Johnson, tried to stop Congress’s Reconstruction program, which aimed to use military force, if necessary, to protect African Americans’ rights (and therefore Republican power) in the former Confederacy. The clash climaxed in 1868, when Congress came within one vote of removing Johnson from the presidency. For the next quarter-century, Congress usually maintained its domination over the executive. Lincoln’s use of power, however, could not be permanently undone. The institutionalized centralization of power required only the rise of foreign affairs to a high place in the nation’s agenda, along with recurring crises resulting from those affairs – crises that, as most presidents believed, the president could best handle.9","['the 1860s', 'the 1890s', '1868', 'the next quarter-century']",line 1860s foreign expansionism 1890s unbroken lincoln exert unusual control congress demonstrate executive ’s broad power stretch immediately war death supreme court move limit power argue constitutional restraint work “ equally war peace ” suspend restraint emergency civil war lead “ directly anarchy despotism lincoln ’s successor andrew johnson try stop congress ’s reconstruction program aim use military force necessary protect african americans’ right republican power confederacy clash climax 1868 congress come vote remove johnson presidency quarter century congress usually maintain domination executive lincoln ’s use power permanently undo institutionalized centralization power require rise foreign affair high place nation ’s agenda recur crisis result affair – crisis president believe president best handle.9,112,"[1860, 1890, 1868]",1873,3,1875,1900
342,"Lincoln’s and Johnson’s secretary of state was William Henry Seward of New York. As a leader of the former Whig party, Seward had bitterly opposed strong Democratic presidents such as Jackson and Polk. In a switch not uncommon in American politics, however, Seward became a strident defender of executive authority when his new Republican party occupied the White House in 1861. The New Yorker indeed constantly preached the need to centralize and rationalize the far-flung continental system so that it could compete with other powers. He developed, moreover, an imperial strategy that was unrealizeable in his lifetime but was to be realized over the next two generations. In a later American society in which marketplace competition is assumed and the ideology simply becomes conventional wisdom, Seward becomes the vital link between the pre- and postindustrial United States.","['1861', 'the next two generations']",lincoln ’s johnson ’s secretary state william henry seward new york leader whig party seward bitterly oppose strong democratic president jackson polk switch uncommon politic seward strident defender executive authority new republican party occupy white house 1861 new yorker constantly preach need centralize rationalize far flung continental system compete power develop imperial strategy unrealizeable lifetime realize generation later society marketplace competition assume ideology simply conventional wisdom seward vital link pre- postindustrial united state,73,[1861],1861,1,1875,1900
343,"He argued that the federal government had to take the lead in this consolidation by passing higher tariffs to protect the home market. Such tariffs were vital in creating new industries that could grow safely until they were able to sell abroad. Seward and the Republicans also developed a more centralized banking system; a land act that rapidly filled the interior; and the 1864 contract labor law and an 1868 treaty that Seward negotiated with China to provide the necessary labor power, as well as inhabitants to populate western lands. Above all, Seward believed in the magic of new technology and transportation to tie the nation together and make it efficient. As governor of New York he had successfully pushed to build the foundations of the state’s railway system. As a U.S. senator in the 1850s, he helped legislate a national improvements program of railways, canals, highways, and ships. As he proclaimed in 1853, “[O]pen up a highway through your country to San Francisco,” and fill the continent with farms and manufacturers, for “the nation that … sells the most of productions and fabrics to foreign nations must be, and will be, the great power of the earth.”10","['1864', '1868', 'the 1850s', '1853']",argue federal government lead consolidation pass high tariff protect home market tariff vital create new industry grow safely able sell abroad seward republicans develop centralized banking system land act rapidly fill interior 1864 contract labor law 1868 treaty seward negotiate china provide necessary labor power inhabitant populate western land seward believe magic new technology transportation tie nation efficient governor new york successfully push build foundation state ’s railway system u.s senator 1850 help legislate national improvement program railway canal highway ship proclaim 1853 “ o]pen highway country san francisco ” fill continent farm manufacturer “ nation … sell production fabric foreign nation great power earth.”10,105,"[1864, 1868, 1850, 1853]",1859,4,1875,1900
344,"Seward combined this vision with another: the Stars and Stripes flying above Canada and Mexico. His passion for landed expansion, however, had cooled during the 1850s, when he understood it could lead to the expansion of slavery and the South’s power. By then he had switched his passion from landed to commercial expansion and from the Western Hemisphere (where the South hoped to expand its “peculiar institution”) to Asia. He declared disingenuously that the Monroe Doctrine had been realized. It was time to prepare for conquering Asian markets, a call to action that a friend promptly tagged the “Seward Doctrine.” The conventional wisdom was that trade followed the flag. Not necessarily so, Seward argued: “Political supremacy follows commercial ascendancy.” He believed Mexico and Canada would join the Union, but peacefully, in time, without the bloodshed of conquest. He feared, moreover, that “mixed races,” such as those in Mexico, could not yet govern themselves. “The empire of the seas,” not land, “alone is real empire,” Seward trumpeted, and Asia, not the Western Hemisphere, was to be “the prize,” “the chief theatre of events in the world’s great hereafter.”11",['the 1850s'],seward combine vision star stripe fly canada mexico passion landed expansion cool 1850 understand lead expansion slavery south ’s power switch passion land commercial expansion western hemisphere south hop expand “ peculiar institution ” asia declare disingenuously monroe doctrine realize time prepare conquer asian market action friend promptly tag “ seward doctrine ” conventional wisdom trade follow flag necessarily seward argue “ political supremacy follow commercial ascendancy ” believe mexico canada join union peacefully time bloodshed conquest fear “ mixed race ” mexico govern “ empire sea ” land “ real empire ” seward trumpet asia western hemisphere “ prize “ chief theatre event world ’s great hereafter.”11,108,[1850],1850,1,1875,1900
345,"Americans’ growing belief that they were using new technology to develop their continent so that they could use it as base from which to conquer that overseas commercial “prize” has aptly been termed “continentalism.” The term opens insights into the entire era from the 1840s to World War I.12 In 1864–5, Seward faced a pivotal test of his theory. Napoleon III of France had taken advantage of the Civil War crisis to send both troops and Archduke Maximilian of Austria to conquer Mexico and its liberal government of Benito Juarez. Napoleon instantly threatened to establish a French empire, block U.S. expansion, and diminish British power in the hemisphere. Pressure grew on the beleaguered Seward to respond. On May 5, 1864, he counseled patience: “Five years, ten years, twenty years hence, Mexico will be opening herself as cheerfully to American immigration as Montana and Idaho are now.” The next day he told the U.S. minister in Madrid that the United States desired no further “conquest” because it already had “abundant territory and all that [Americans] can improve.” Seward’s remarks signaled that nearly three hundred years of American landed expansion was ending. After the Civil War, U.S. armies mobilized on the Mexican border to drive out the French, but they were unneeded. The Mexicans executed Maximilian and destroyed Napoleon’s dreams.13","['the entire era', 'the 1840s', 'May 5, 1864', 'Five years', 'ten years', 'twenty years', 'The next day', 'nearly three hundred years']",americans’ grow belief new technology develop continent use base conquer overseas commercial “ prize ” aptly term “ continentalism ” term open insight entire era 1840s world war i.12 1864–5 seward face pivotal test theory napoleon iii france take advantage civil war crisis send troop archduke maximilian austria conquer mexico liberal government benito juarez napoleon instantly threaten establish french empire block u.s expansion diminish british power hemisphere pressure grow beleaguered seward respond 5 1864 counsel patience “ year year year mexico open cheerfully immigration montana idaho ” day tell u.s minister madrid united state desire “ conquest ” “ abundant territory american improve ” seward ’s remark signal nearly year land expansion end civil war u.s army mobilize mexican border drive french unneeded mexican execute maximilian destroy napoleon ’s dreams.13,130,"[1840, 1864]",1852,2,1875,1900
346,"The future was glimpsed: Reactionary European colonialists were replaced by Americans who would “value dollars more, and dominion less,” as Seward succinctly put it. Another answer appeared when he learned in 1867 that Egyptians had convened a legislative assembly in Cairo. The assembly demonstrated, Seward concluded, “that popular govt, follows in the track of the steam engine and the telegraph,” even this “soon in Africa.”14 Yet another answer appeared between 1866 and 1868 when the secretary of state embarked on a breathtaking plan to build his own “highway” to Asia by obtaining naval bases and isthmian canal rights in the Caribbean region, seizing a foothold on Hawaii, and applying military pressure on Asia.","['1867', 'between 1866 and 1868']",future glimpse reactionary european colonialist replace american “ value dollar dominion ” seward succinctly answer appear learn 1867 egyptians convene legislative assembly cairo assembly demonstrate seward conclude “ popular govt follow track steam engine telegraph ” “ soon africa.”14 answer appear 1866 1868 secretary state embark breathtaking plan build “ highway ” asia obtain naval base isthmian canal right caribbean region seize foothold hawaii apply military pressure asia,68,[1867],1867,1,1875,1900
347,"Seward’s grand plan, however, crashed into roadblocks on the highway to Asia. He was nearly killed by a colleague of the assassin who shot Lincoln in April 1865. Recovering slowly, Seward watched as the new president and congressional Republicans clashed over Reconstruction policies. Johnson, born to poor white stock in Tennessee, had little sympathy for freed African Americans and wanted the South to return immediately to the Union. Leading lawmakers were determined to punish the South and protect the former slaves. Seward not only sided with Johnson but also persistently urged him to move rapidly in readmitting the old Confederacy to the Union. The secretary of state’s motives were mixed. He respected the former Confederate leaders, many of whom had been his prewar colleagues in the Whig party, and he believed they formed a safe, cooperative core for Southern state governments. It might have been that the sixty-five-year-old Seward viewed these friends as part of a new political party that would catapult him into the presidency in 1868. There is no doubt he believed that African Americans were unable to govern themselves, let alone govern whites, and that (as he told Southerners) perhaps slavery could be replaced by a kind of involuntary apprenticeship on the plantations. “The North has nothing to do with the negroes [sic],” Seward told liberal friends in April 1866. “I have no more concern for them than I have for the Hottentots…. They are not of our race…. The North must get over this notion of interference with the affairs of the South.”15 That letter illustrated, among other things, why Seward and many other Americans wanted no more landed expansion southward that might bring more non-Caucasians (a number of Americans narrowed this to non–Anglo-Saxons) into the Union.","['April 1865', '1868', 'April 1866']",seward ’s grand plan crash roadblock highway asia nearly kill colleague assassin shoot lincoln april 1865 recover slowly seward watch new president congressional republican clash reconstruction policy johnson bear poor white stock tennessee little sympathy free african american want south return immediately union lead lawmaker determine punish south protect slave seward side johnson persistently urge rapidly readmitt old confederacy union secretary state ’s motif mixed respect confederate leader prewar colleague whig party believe form safe cooperative core southern state government year old seward view friend new political party catapult presidency 1868 doubt believe african american unable govern let govern white tell southerner slavery replace kind involuntary apprenticeship plantation “ north negro sic ” seward tell liberal friend april 1866 “ concern hottentot … race … north notion interference affair south.”15 letter illustrate thing seward american want land expansion southward bring non caucasians number american narrow non – anglo saxon union,150,"[1865, 1868, 1866]",1866,3,1875,1900
348,"Furious Radical Republicans speculated that Seward was the evil genius behind Johnson’s policy. In late 1866 the secretary of state admitted that in his long, combative public life he had never been so maligned.16 The elections that autumn gave the Radical Republicans sufficient control of Congress to pass their program over Johnson’s vetoes. Within a year they threatened not only to isolate the president but also to impeach him. Seward’s foreign policy plans were stymied, however, not only because of the political Armageddon that threatened.","['late 1866', 'autumn', 'a year']",furious radical republican speculate seward evil genius johnson ’s policy late 1866 secretary state admit long combative public life maligned.16 election autumn give radical republicans sufficient control congress pass program johnson ’s veto year threaten isolate president impeach seward ’s foreign policy plan stymie political armageddon threaten,47,[1866],1866,1,1875,1900
349,"Against these odds, the secretary of state signed a treaty with Russia in 1867 to purchase Alaska for $7.2 million and then convinced Sumner and other Radical Republicans to help him push the pact through the Senate. The deal had long been gestating. At least as early as the 1830s the Russians understood they had lost control of Alaska’s trade and even its food supply to the ubiquitous New England traders who had been exploiting the region for decades. Nor could the territory be defended against a British attack from neighboring Canada, or against Americans intent upon repeating the settlement-and-conquer process that had turned Texas into part of the Union in 1845. As one influential, knowledgeable Russian official (I. A. Shestakov) warned, Europeans might be cynical about “the Monroe Doctrine or the dogma of Manifest Destiny,” but in North America “this principle enters more and more into the veins of the people and … the latest generation imbibes it with its mother’s milk and inhales it with the air.” Officials around Tsar Nicholas I wanted to end their shaky hold on Alaska and concentrate instead on developing the potentially rich Amur River region in Asiatic Russia. By the mid-1850s the tsar was moving to sell, but obstacles arose, not least the Civil War. During that conflict Americans viewed Russia as a strong supporter of the Union, quite in contrast to the tsar’s enemy, Great Britain, with whom Lincoln and Seward endured a series of crises between 1861 and 1863. The afterglow of Russia’s support helped warm the political atmosphere as Seward, after signing the treaty late on the evening of March 30, 1867, at his home with Russian Minister Edouard de Stoeckel, prepared to battle the Senate.","['1867', 'the 1830s', 'decades', '1845', 'the mid-1850s', 'between 1861 and 1863', 'March 30, 1867']",odd secretary state sign treaty russia 1867 purchase alaska 7.2 million convince sumner radical republican help push pact senate deal long gestate early 1830s russian understand lose control alaska ’s trade food supply ubiquitous new england trader exploit region decade territory defend british attack neighbor canada american intent repeat settlement conquer process turn texas union 1845 influential knowledgeable russian official i. a. shestakov warn europeans cynical “ monroe doctrine dogma manifest destiny ” north america “ principle enter vein people … late generation imbibe mother ’s milk inhale air ” official tsar nicholas want end shaky hold alaska concentrate instead develop potentially rich amur river region asiatic russia mid-1850 tsar move sell obstacle arise civil war conflict american view russia strong supporter union contrast tsar ’s enemy great britain lincoln seward endure series crisis 1861 1863 afterglow russia ’s support help warm political atmosphere seward sign treaty late evening march 30 1867 home russian minister edouard de stoeckel prepare battle senate,161,"[1867, 1830, 1845, 1850, 1867]",1852,5,1875,1900
350,"The battle was intense, but quickly won. At the start Seward gained high ground by emphasizing Russia’s friendship and flooding the Senate with information that fulsomely described Alaska’s riches and strategic position. The global ambitions of U.S. technology provided much of his information. During the war Seward had worked closely with Perry M. Collins and Hiram Sibley (president of Western Union) to lay a telegraph line through the United States, across Alaska, the Bering Straits, and Siberia. The Collins Overland Line intended to dominate global communications. The line would “extend throughout the world American ideas and principles of public and private economy, politics, morals, philosophy, and religion,” Seward exalted. Cyrus Field’s success in laying the Atlantic cable in the mid-1860s, however, destroyed Collins’s plans. The negotiations with Russia nevertheless both paved the way to talks about Alaska and provided large amounts of material on the possible wealth in “Seward’s Icebox,” as it was soon known. Even a former diplomat, John Bigelow, sarcastically wrote, “Henceforth we need apprehend no failure of our ice crop…. What good the Alaskan territory can ever do us, God only knows.” The part of Alaska Americans paid less attention to was its people. Some Russian authorities were quite interested in the Eskimo and Aleut population, but U.S. officials seemed to see Alaska much as they had seen their own continental “frontier”: as a potential for power and not as a home for native peoples.18",['the mid-1860s'],battle intense quickly win start seward gain high ground emphasize russia ’s friendship flood senate information fulsomely describe alaska ’s rich strategic position global ambition u.s technology provide information war seward work closely perry m. collins hiram sibley president western union lay telegraph line united state alaska ber strait siberia collins overland line intend dominate global communication line “ extend world idea principle public private economy politic moral philosophy religion ” seward exalt cyrus field ’s success lay atlantic cable mid-1860 destroy collins ’s plan negotiation russia pave way talk alaska provide large amount material possible wealth “ seward ’s icebox ” soon know diplomat john bigelow sarcastically write “ henceforth need apprehend failure ice crop … good alaskan territory god know ” alaska american pay attention people russian authority interested eskimo aleut population u.s official alaska see continental “ frontier ” potential power home native peoples.18,147,[1860],1860,1,1875,1900
351,"In his three-hour Senate speech supporting the treaty, Sumner stressed Alaska’s worth, not simply Russian friendship. He, Seward, and many newspapers also emphasized that strategically the Alaska purchase could mean the inevitable annexation as well of British Columbia, now squeezed between two parts of the United States, if not the taking of much more of Canada. (The British minister in Washington reported home that the pact signaled a U.S.-Russian move against England’s power and could mean as well the British loss of all Canada.)

352,"The House, however, refused to pass the necessary appropriations measure until 1868. The Radical Republicans, who controlled the body, were taken up with Reconstruction and impeachment struggles, not Seward’s grandiose plans. In foreign policy President Johnson was an unwanted second violinist in the secretary of state’s one-man band. After the House moved to impeach Johnson, it finally passed the pact 113–43, with 44 members not voting. Nathaniel Banks (R.-Mass.), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, led the protreaty forces. Not a Radical Republican, he tended to agree with Seward that the South should be brought back in quickly and foreign expansion expedited. With a keen eye for advancing his home state’s commerce, a firsthand knowledge of the burgeoning American West, and warm friendship for Seward, Banks argued that the Aleutians, the “drawbridge between America and Asia,” could give the United States new power in the Pacific Ocean area, which would be the “controller of the destiny of nations and the progress of mankind.” Another House member added that the purchase would “cage the British lion” and hasten the day when “the two great Powers on earth will be Russia and the United States.” To ensure passage, the tsar’s minister apparently distributed money to key members, although the importance of the payments has been disputed by recent scholarship. Certainly Seward’s raising of the Stars and Stripes in Alaska six months earlier helped his cause. “Palsied be the hand that would dare remove it,” one House member exclaimed.20","['1868', 'the day', 'six months earlier']",house refuse pass necessary appropriation measure 1868 radical republican control body take reconstruction impeachment struggle seward ’s grandiose plan foreign policy president johnson unwanted second violinist secretary state ’s man band house move impeach johnson finally pass pact 113–43 44 member vote nathaniel bank r .- mass chair house foreign affair committee lead protreaty force radical republican tend agree seward south bring quickly foreign expansion expedite keen eye advance home state ’s commerce firsthand knowledge burgeon west warm friendship seward bank argue aleutian “ drawbridge america asia ” united state new power pacific ocean area “ controller destiny nation progress mankind ” house member add purchase “ cage british lion ” hasten day “ great power earth russia united state ” ensure passage tsar ’s minister apparently distribute money key member importance payment dispute recent scholarship certainly seward ’s raising star stripe alaska month earlier help because “ palsied hand dare remove ” house member exclaimed.20,156,[1868],1868,1,1875,1900
353," Alaska was seen as crucial in extending the U.S. reach into Asia. Seward’s son, Frederick W. Seward, worked closely with his father and later recalled that it was argued that the purchase would give Americans “a foothold for commercial and naval operations accessible from the Pacific States.” The secretary of state’s view literally knew no bounds. In May 1867, after the Senate ratification, he wrote a poem:",['May 1867'],alaska see crucial extend u.s reach asia seward ’s son frederick w. seward work closely father later recall argue purchase american “ foothold commercial naval operation accessible pacific state ” secretary state ’s view literally know bound 1867 senate ratification write poem,42,[1867],1867,1,1875,1900
354,"He focused on the Caribbean. During the Civil War, the U.S. navy discovered its need for a dependable Caribbean base. Europeans, led by Spain, had meanwhile taken advantage of the crisis to try to regain control of Santo Domingo. After the rising power of Prussia defeated Denmark in 1864, rumors circulated that the Prussians or Austrians would take the Danish West Indies (the Virgin Islands). Europeans and Americans seemed to be on a collision course. The Confederacy’s defeat meant the end of proslavery filibustering expeditions and thus helped reignite the North’s interest in the Caribbean region. Emancipation had also finally aligned the United States with all of Latin America, which, except for Cuba and Brazil, was free of slavery. The climate cooled when Spain threatened Chile and Peru in 1866, and Seward, instead of wheeling out the Monroe Doctrine, looked the other way. His focus instead was more specific: the gateways for U.S. commercial and strategic supremacy that bases in the Caribbean and the Central American isthmus could open.22","['1864', '1866']",focus caribbean civil war u.s navy discover need dependable caribbean base europeans lead spain take advantage crisis try regain control santo domingo rise power prussia defeat denmark 1864 rumor circulate prussian austrian danish west indie virgin island europeans american collision course confederacy ’s defeat mean end proslavery filibustering expedition help reignite north ’s interest caribbean region emancipation finally align united state latin america cuba brazil free slavery climate cool spain threaten chile peru 1866 seward instead wheel monroe doctrine look way focus instead specific gateway u.s commercial strategic supremacy base caribbean central isthmus open.22,94,"[1864, 1866]",1865,2,1875,1900
355,"In July 1867 Seward signed a treaty with Denmark to purchase the Virgin Islands for $7.5 million if the inhabitants agreed in a plebiscite. The plebiscite passed, but the treaty crashed against Senate opposition to spending such money (all of Alaska had cost only $7.2 million). The opponents felt confirmed in their wisdom when a hurricane hit the islands. Seward backed off, but he warned Europe that “no transfer of colonies in the West Indies between European powers can be indifferent to the United States.” That declaration reinforced the “no-transfer” principle first issued by President James Madison in 1811. (The United States finally obtained the Virgin Islands in 1917.) Seward also tried in 1866 to deal through U.S. adventurers who had gained power in Santo Domingo to obtain land at Samana Bay in return for several million dollars. He wined and dined Radical Republican leader Thaddeus Stevens until the House gave him money for the negotiations. This result was notable given that Stevens hated Johnson’s Reconstruction measures and had called Seward the president’s “chief clown.” The treaty, however, failed because some in Santo Domingo wanted more money, while others feared that giving land away might lead to mass revolt. In Washington, Seward ran into ancient enemies within the Republican party. Navy Secretary Gideon Welles opposed obtaining a Caribbean naval base because Seward “has become almost a monomaniac on the subject of territorial acquisition, that being the hobby horse on which he expects to be a candidate for President.”23","['July 1867', '1811', '1917', '1866']",july 1867 seward sign treaty denmark purchase virgin island 7.5 million inhabitant agree plebiscite plebiscite pass treaty crash senate opposition spend money alaska cost 7.2 million opponent feel confirm wisdom hurricane hit island seward back warn europe “ transfer colony west indie european power indifferent united state ” declaration reinforce “ transfer ” principle issue president james madison 1811 united state finally obtain virgin island 1917 seward try 1866 deal u.s adventurer gain power santo domingo obtain land samana bay return million dollar win din radical republican leader thaddeus steven house give money negotiation result notable give stevens hat johnson ’s reconstruction measure call seward president ’s “ chief clown ” treaty fail santo domingo want money fear give land away lead mass revolt washington seward run ancient enemy republican party navy secretary gideon welles oppose obtain caribbean naval base seward “ monomaniac subject territorial acquisition hobby horse expect candidate president.”23,151,"[1867, 1811, 1917, 1866]",1865,4,1875,1900
356,"Stopped in the Caribbean, Seward worked with a group of New York businessmen to obtain rights to build the long-coveted isthmian canal. A first treaty with Nicaragua in mid-1867 passed the Senate because it gave the United States nonexclusive rights and so did not break the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, made with Great Britain in 1850, which provided that the two countries would jointly develop any canal. In January 1869, however, Seward sent one of his best diplomats, Caleb Cushing of the Massachusetts mercantile community, to sign a treaty giving the United States (or a private company such as one formed by Seward’s New York friends) rights to build a twenty-mile-wide canal through Colombia’s Panama province and to build it under U.S. direction. It marked the first time the United States indicated that it intended to control, not merely share, any canal. The Senate refused to accept this deal, in part because of the 1850 commitment for only joint development with the British. Fourteen years later, however, another exclusive treaty was negotiated, this time with Nicaragua, and twenty years after that the United States indeed exclusively controlled a canal that linked the two great oceans.24","['mid-1867', '1850', 'January 1869', '1850', 'Fourteen years later', 'twenty years']",stop caribbean seward work group new york businessman obtain right build long covet isthmian canal treaty nicaragua mid-1867 pass senate give united state nonexclusive right break clayton bulwer treaty great britain 1850 provide country jointly develop canal january 1869 seward send good diplomat caleb cushing massachusetts mercantile community sign treaty give united state private company form seward ’s new york friend right build mile wide canal colombia ’s panama province build u.s direction mark time united state indicate intend control merely share canal senate refuse accept deal 1850 commitment joint development british fourteen year later exclusive treaty negotiate time nicaragua year united state exclusively control canal link great oceans.24,109,"[1867, 1850, 1869, 1850]",1859,4,1875,1900
357,"During the burst of activity in 1867–8, Seward also tried to gain a foothold on Hawaii. Massachusetts interests, with Sumner in the fore, worked with the secretary of state to pull Hawaii into the U.S. orbit with a commercial reciprocity treaty. Seward instructed the U.S. negotiator that reciprocity was fine, but if Hawaiians were interested, quick annexation would be even better. In 1863, the secretary of state had raised the U.S. presence to the ministerial (or highest diplomatic) level. Minister Edward McCook now echoed his superior with his explanation of the treaty’s meaning: “When the [U.S. transcontinental] Pacific Railroad is completed, and the commerce of Asia directed to our Pacific ports, then these islands will be needed as a rendezvous for our Pacific navy, and a resort for merchant ships, and this treaty will have prepared the way for this quiet absorption.” Senate power Justin Morrill (R.-Maine) disagreed. A high-tariff fanatic who had been one of two senators to oppose the Alaska purchase (his Senate colleague from Maine was the other), Morrill wanted no break in his tariff wall. Other members feared, correctly, that by giving the president the power to negotiate reciprocity provisions, Congress would lose some of its own power. Morrill’s side defeated the treaty, but Seward’s vision triumphed when an 1875 pact was signed. The results were just as Minister McCook had prophesied. Meanwhile, on Washington’s instructions, a U.S. navy officer had taken possession of the uninhabited Brooks Island, twelve hundred miles west of Hawaii. Congress went along because it cost nothing. In 1903 the renamed Midway Island became a permanent U.S. naval base that was to play a prominent role in twentieth-century history.25","['1863', '1875', '1903', 'twentieth-century']",burst activity 1867–8 seward try gain foothold hawaii massachusetts interest sumner fore work secretary state pull hawaii u.s orbit commercial reciprocity treaty seward instruct u.s negotiator reciprocity fine hawaiian interested quick annexation good 1863 secretary state raise u.s presence ministerial high diplomatic level minister edward mccook echo superior explanation treaty ’s meaning “ u.s transcontinental pacific railroad complete commerce asia direct pacific port island need rendezvous pacific navy resort merchant ship treaty prepare way quiet absorption ” senate power justin morrill r .- maine disagree high tariff fanatic senator oppose alaska purchase senate colleague maine morrill want break tariff wall member fear correctly give president power negotiate reciprocity provision congress lose power morrill ’s defeat treaty seward ’s vision triumph 1875 pact sign result minister mccook prophesy washington ’s instruction u.s navy officer take possession uninhabited brook island mile west hawaii congress go cost 1903 rename midway island permanent u.s naval base play prominent role twentieth century history.25,158,"[1863, 1875, 1903]",1880,3,1900,1900
358,"Seward had great plans for Asia, but his power never caught up with his vision. The gap led him to introduce two new principles in U.S.-Asian policies, principles that shaped those policies through most of the next eighty years. Indeed, a distinguished historian of U.S.-Asia relations, Tyler Dennett, wrote in 1922 that “absolutely no new principles have been added to American Far Eastern policy since 1869.” The foundation of that policy had been laid with the Sino-U.S. treaty of 1844, in which China pledged an Open Door and equal opportunity for Americans. The policy was maintained by following along in back of British and French demands and, in a kind of scavenger diplomacy, demanding from China trade rights equal to those extracted by the Europeans. In the 1860s, however, Civil War needs reduced the U.S. naval presence to a single ship. Unwilling to pull back from Asia even while waging war to save the Union, Seward formulated a policy of upholding equal U.S. opportunities by following the principles of cooperation (rather than being the go-it-alone scavenger) and of using force if necessary. The two principles were carried out by U.S. minister Anson Burlingame, a former Massachusetts lawmaker who wanted China to respect foreign rights but was equally determined to uphold China’s territorial integrity (a basic precondition, of course, to being able to trade in all of China). Burlingame’s sensitivity later led the Chinese to have him represent them in Western capitals; in 1868 Seward negotiated the Burlingame Treaty with him to allow Chinese laborers into the United States.26","['the next eighty years', '1922', '1869', '1844', 'the 1860s', '1868']",seward great plan asia power catch vision gap lead introduce new principle u.s .- asian policy principle shape policy eighty year distinguished historian u.s .- asia relation tyler dennett write 1922 absolutely new principle add far eastern policy 1869 ” foundation policy lay sino u.s treaty 1844 china pledge open door equal opportunity american policy maintain follow british french demand kind scavenger diplomacy demand china trade right equal extract europeans 1860s civil war need reduce u.s naval presence single ship unwilling pull asia wag war save union seward formulate policy uphold equal u.s opportunity follow principle cooperation scavenger force necessary principle carry u.s minister anson burlingame massachusetts lawmaker want china respect foreign right equally determined uphold china ’s territorial integrity basic precondition course able trade china burlingame ’s sensitivity later lead chinese represent western capital 1868 seward negotiate burlingame treaty allow chinese laborer united states.26,145,"[1922, 1869, 1844, 1860, 1868]",1873,5,1875,1900
359,"The principles of cooperation and use of force were quickly applied. In 1864 Japan, still trying to close itself off from the West, apparently burned the U.S. legation (although the actual cause of the fire was disputed) and closed the Strait of Shimoneseki to all foreign shipping. Seward had a visceral reaction to any nation that tried to shut itself off from trade. He saw it as an unnatural and immoral act. Seward especially grew angry because the Japanese opposed the proselytizing and practicing of Christianity. The U.S. minister to Japan, R. H. Pruyn, revealed another notable U.S. perspective when he wrote Seward in 1862 that all Western diplomats “in Japan are sentinels in this outpost of civilization. It is here as with our Indian tribes … the bolt [sneak attack] comes out of an unclouded sky.” In this Far West, the natives understood only force. Thus the U.S.S. Wyoming joined British, French, and Dutch ships, which blasted their way into the strait and then, in 1866, dictated trade treaties. With the Civil War ended, Seward dispatched three more warships to Asian waters. After Korea murdered passengers and crew of a U.S. merchantman in 1866, he again wanted to use force, but France refused to cooperate. He also sent his nephew George F. Seward to open Korea much as Admiral Matthew Perry had opened Japan in 1853. The younger man failed; he also refused to use force, as the secretary of state suggested he might, to gain access to the so-called Hermit Kingdom.27","['1864', '1862', '1866', '1866', '1853']",principle cooperation use force quickly apply 1864 japan try close west apparently burn u.s legation actual because fire dispute close strait shimoneseki foreign shipping seward visceral reaction nation try shut trade see unnatural immoral act seward especially grow angry japanese oppose proselytizing practicing christianity u.s minister japan r. h. pruyn reveal notable u.s perspective write seward 1862 western diplomat “ japan sentinel outpost civilization indian tribe … bolt sneak attack come unclouded sky ” far west native understand force u.s. wyoming join british french dutch ship blast way strait 1866 dictate trade treaty civil war end seward dispatch warship asian water korea murder passenger crew u.s merchantman 1866 want use force france refuse cooperate send nephew george f. seward open korea admiral matthew perry open japan 1853 young man fail refuse use force secretary state suggest gain access call hermit kingdom.27,141,"[1864, 1862, 1866, 1866, 1853]",1862,5,1875,1900
360,"Seward not only added new principles but also created a new dilemma that plagued U.S. policies in China (and elsewhere) for decades. On the one hand, he instructed the U.S. legation in Peking on September 8, 1868, that China must be pushed to “make all … concessions” as rapidly as possible for trade, railway construction, and telegraphs. On the other hand, these demands were not to be pressed so as to endanger “the stability of the present Government or the internal peace and tranquillity of China.”28","['decades', 'September 8, 1868']",seward add new principle create new dilemma plague u.s policy china decade hand instruct u.s legation peking september 8 1868 china push “ … concession ” rapidly possible trade railway construction telegraphs hand demand press endanger “ stability present government internal peace tranquillity china.”28,44,[1868],1868,1,1875,1900
361,"The quest for order was at first undermined, and in two generations destroyed, by the American quest for trade and power. Neither Seward nor any other official could ever discover how to extract extensive concessions from weaker nations without ultimately undermining the order, if not the sovereignty, of that nation. As Americans made real many of Seward’s visions for the Caribbean, Pacific, and Asian regions in the post-1893 years, they also faced the dilemma he outlined in September 1868. Indeed, his dilemma became a trap for later Americans. Not able to have both equal opportunity and order in their foreign policies, they chose the former and risked the latter.","['the post-1893 years', 'September 1868']",quest order undermine generation destroy quest trade power seward official discover extract extensive concession weak nation ultimately undermine order sovereignty nation american real seward ’s vision caribbean pacific asian region post-1893 year face dilemma outline september 1868 dilemma trap later american able equal opportunity order foreign policy choose risk,49,"[1893, 1868]",1880,2,1900,1900
362," In early 1869 the departing Seward had to be content with some distant islands and Alaska. In November 1867, the House had resolved that it might pass the Alaska purchase appropriation, but “in the present financial condition of the country any further purchases of territory are inexpedient.” President Johnson responded in his 1868 annual message: “Comprehensive national policy would seem to sanction the acquisition and incorporation into our Federal Union of the several adjacent continental and insular communities as speedily as it can be done peacefully, lawfully.” The secretary of state doubtless wrote those words. In August 1869, after he left office, Seward declared at Salem, Oregon, that expansionism that voluntarily brought in adjoining lands and turned them into “new states” was not only inevitable but also “essential for the security of civil and religious liberty” in the United States. His close friend and distinguished minister to Great Britain, Charles Francis Adams, later drew the appropriate conclusion in his eulogy of the former secretary of state:","['early 1869', 'November 1867', '1868', 'annual', 'August 1869']",early 1869 depart seward content distant island alaska november 1867 house resolve pass alaska purchase appropriation “ present financial condition country purchase territory inexpedient ” president johnson respond 1868 annual message “ comprehensive national policy sanction acquisition incorporation federal union adjacent continental insular community speedily peacefully lawfully ” secretary state doubtless write word august 1869 leave office seward declare salem oregon expansionism voluntarily bring adjoining land turn “ new state ” inevitable “ essential security civil religious liberty ” united state close friend distinguished minister great britain charles francis adams later draw appropriate conclusion eulogy secretary state,97,"[1869, 1867, 1868, 1869]",1868,4,1875,1900

364,"The basis of U.S. global power in the early twentieth century was economic. From the 1890s on, the nation had emerged as the greatest and most competitive player in the global marketplace. Fearful Europeans warned of an “American invasion” (an overwhelming offensive of U.S.-made goods and multinationals) long before they worried about the challenge of U.S. military, political, or cultural power. The invasion, moreover, proved deadly not only because of its magnitude but also because it was fueled by a growing crisis inside the United States, which was, ironically, caused by that very economic success. The depth and disorder of the crisis marked a historic turning point in the development of both American capitalism and the American empire. The imperial visions of Seward, and others who followed the New Yorker, were not, for the most part, made real by “large-policy” officials, bureaucratic processes, public opinion, or frustrated Progressive reformers. Rather, those visions were realized by the architects of the Second Industrial Revolution, such as Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Cyrus McCormick, J. P. Morgan, and E. H. Harriman, who redesigned the production system.","['the early twentieth century', 'the 1890s']",basis u.s global power early twentieth century economic 1890s nation emerge great competitive player global marketplace fearful europeans warn “ invasion ” overwhelming offensive u.s .- good multinational long worry challenge u.s military political cultural power invasion prove deadly magnitude fuel grow crisis inside united state ironically cause economic success depth disorder crisis mark historic turning point development capitalism empire imperial vision seward follow new yorker real “ large policy ” official bureaucratic process public opinion frustrated progressive reformer vision realize architect second industrial revolution andrew carnegie john d. rockefeller cyrus mccormick j. p. morgan e. h. harriman redesign production system,101,[1890],1890,1,1900,1900
365,"The key to American economic leadership, however, did not rest only on new technology and fuels. It required investment, that is, the entrepreneur’s ability to tap the incredibly high American savings rates, which had been an impressive 10 to 12 percent of national output in the 1850s but soared to an unbelievable 18 to 20 percent between 1865 and 1914. It also depended on exploiting traditional sources of foreign investment. This amounted to $3 billion in the late 1880s; in the British case alone, it reached a net $1.5 billion of investment in the United States between 1870 and 1895. In analyzing this era, historian Michael Hunt noted that of the qualities that make a nation prominent, “wealth belongs at the head of the list. Only a dynamic and growing economy can create the material resources essential to realizing great international ambitions.”2","['the 1850s', 'between 1865 and 1914', 'the late 1880s', 'between 1870 and 1895', 'this era']",key economic leadership rest new technology fuel require investment entrepreneur ’s ability tap incredibly high saving rate impressive 10 12 percent national output 1850 soar unbelievable 18 20 percent 1865 1914 depend exploit traditional source foreign investment amount 3 billion late 1880 british case reach net 1.5 billion investment united state 1870 1895 analyze era historian michael hunt note quality nation prominent “ wealth belong head list dynamic grow economy create material resource essential realize great international ambitions.”2,78,"[1850, 1880]",1865,2,1875,1900

Corporations could best gather and target needed investment, as well as generate profits and market share that produced future investment. The successful, lonely inventor was rapidly becoming a figure of the past. Edison’s laboratory of the 1870s became the General Electric Corporation of 1901 because the corporation could be immeasurably more successful in obtaining capital, political help, and market share both at home and, increasingly, abroad. American universities meanwhile developed schools of engineering and business courses to supply the needs of the new corporation. And the political parties, led by such men as James G. Blaine and William McKinley, quickly adapted. Those who did not adapt either disappeared (as did the Populists and the Knights of Labor) or lost national power (as did the Democratic party). There was no reason to believe that foreign policy, which is the overseas representation of these domestic interests, would be an exception to the iron rule of the new corporation.3","['the 1880s', 'the 1870s', '1901']",domestic corporation – significant appearance 1880s multinational corporation – organization choice corporation best gather target need investment generate profit market share produce future investment successful lonely inventor rapidly figure past edison ’s laboratory 1870s general electric corporation 1901 corporation immeasurably successful obtain capital political help market share home increasingly abroad university develop school engineering business course supply need new corporation political party lead man jame g. blaine william mckinley quickly adapt adapt disappear populist knight labor lose national power democratic party reason believe foreign policy overseas representation domestic interest exception iron rule new corporation.3,94,"[1880, 1870, 1901]",1884,3,1900,1900
367,"The rate of change seemed to be accelerating so rapidly that Henry Adams, perhaps the best American mind of the age, worked out theories based on science, mathematics, and productivity to demonstrate that change was not only faster than it had been in Adams’s “troglodytic” eighteenth-century Boston but also roaring ahead at a faster pace than the sociopolitical system could hope to match. In the America of 1860 no steel and little oil was produced. Forty years later Americans had created a global empire of steel and oil. In 1871 two railroads met at an Alabama crossroads grandly named Birmingham; within thirty years the city’s plants exported 300,000 tons of top-quality steel in only six months and successfully competed in markets once dominated by the powerful steelmakers of Birmingham, England. The era began in 1860 with 30,000 miles of U.S. railways (which did amount to half the world’s rail mileage) and ended not only with 259,000 miles of railroads but the Wright brothers’ airplane as well. Edith Wharton quoted Wilbur Wright saying, “I can conceive that aeroplanes might possibly be of some use in war, but never for any commercial purpose or as a regular means of communication.”4","['eighteenth-century', '1860', 'Forty years later', '1871', 'thirty years', 'only six months', 'The era began in 1860']","rate change accelerate rapidly henry adams good mind age work theory base science mathematic productivity demonstrate change faster adams ’s “ troglodytic ” eighteenth century boston roar ahead fast pace sociopolitical system hope match america 1860 steel little oil produce year later american create global empire steel oil 1871 railroad meet alabama crossroad grandly name birmingham thirty year city ’s plant export 300,000 ton quality steel month successfully compete market dominate powerful steelmaker birmingham england era begin 1860 30,000 mile u.s railway half world ’s rail mileage end 259,000 mile railroad wright brothers’ airplane edith wharton quote wilbur wright say “ conceive aeroplane possibly use war commercial purpose regular mean communication.”4",111,"[1860, 1871, 1860]",1864,3,1875,1900
368,"America of 1865 might have been dominated by isolated, parochial communities, but by 1900 many had been linked by the Second Industrial Revolution. As U.S. officials were putting together a new global empire, these communities were becoming, often unwillingly, part of an international marketplace. The defeated South was among the first to be brought into the revolution. Historian C. Vann Woodward has suggested that during the 1865–77 Reconstruction era, the eleven former Confederate states might “be thought of as so many Latin American Republics simultaneously in the throes of revolution, with the Colossus of the North hovering over them, one of its proconsuls and its military guard in each, and each state with its own ties to the current [United] Fruit or Standard Oil.” The proconsul era proved to be relatively short because the South understood that it had to choose one of two paths: “The right fork led to the East and the left fork to the West…. The Conservatives and right-fork won in 1877.” Rich rewards were reaped for making the right choice. Between 1880 and 1900 the tide of capital investments alone rose from $250 million to $1 billion, worker population doubled, and profits of 22 percent were average.5","['1865', '1900', '1877', 'Between 1880 and 1900']",america 1865 dominate isolated parochial community 1900 link second industrial revolution u.s official put new global empire community unwillingly international marketplace defeat south bring revolution historian c. vann woodward suggest 1865–77 reconstruction era confederate state “ think latin republic simultaneously throe revolution colossus north hover proconsuls military guard state tie current united fruit standard oil ” proconsul era prove relatively short south understand choose path “ right fork lead east left fork west … conservative right fork win 1877 ” rich reward reap make right choice 1880 1900 tide capital investment rise 250 million 1 billion worker population double profit 22 percent average.5,103,"[1865, 1900, 1877]",1881,3,1900,1900
369,"Before the Civil War the South’s cotton exports had made the region a part of the world marketplace, although not the “King” that many Southerners assumed. But the story had only begun. During the birth of the U.S. Industrial Revolution in the 1840s, the South had begun its own cotton mill complex. Between 1870 and 1891 production more than doubled in cotton from 4.3 million bales to 9 million. Such fecundity forced the price down from eighteen cents per pound in 1871 to seven cents in 1900. Northern capital flooded in to combine cheap cotton with laborers making twelve cents per day (many of whom were bankrupt tenant farmers forced into the mill towns to survive). The competitiveness allowed owners in the South to exploit new markets in Asia or take old ones away from New England mills. The South so successfully did both that northern mills tried to cut off capital to the South’s mills. A Bostonian admitted, “Southern mills are now exporting more cotton fabrics to China than all New England.” The post-1873 depression accelerated the export drive, even as (indeed, because) the richly capitalized mills produced more goods, forced prices down, and thus helped sharpen the economic downturn. Between 1875 and 1880, exports of U.S. cotton goods increased by three times compared with those of 1871 to 1875. One estimate concluded that about 20 percent of all its manufactures had to be exported if the U.S. cotton-goods industry was to survive. Between 1887 and 1897, as the domestic market agonized under the weight of depression, textile exports to China rose 120 percent. Foreign and domestic policy implications were understood; southern textile representatives, for example, unsuccessfully opposed the 1882 act excluding Chinese immigrants from the United States for ten years because China might cut off imports in retaliation. Congressman Hernando D. Money of Mississippi observed in 1876 that because “the march of empire is westward,” and because “every people who have enjoyed Asiatic commerce have grown rich and prosperous,” the United States must possess Hawaii as a way station to the Asian markets.6","['the 1840s', 'Between 1870 and 1891', '1871', '1900', 'post-1873', 'Between 1875 and 1880', '1871 to 1875', 'Between 1887 and 1897', '1882', 'ten years', '1876']",civil war south ’s cotton export region world marketplace “ king ” southerner assume story begin birth u.s industrial revolution 1840s south begin cotton mill complex 1870 1891 production double cotton 4.3 million bale 9 million fecundity force price eighteen cent pound 1871 seven cent 1900 northern capital flood combine cheap cotton laborer make cent day bankrupt tenant farmer force mill town survive competitiveness allow owner south exploit new market asia old one away new england mill south successfully northern mill try cut capital south ’s mill bostonian admit “ southern mill export cotton fabric china new england ” post-1873 depression accelerate export drive richly capitalize mill produce good force price help sharpen economic downturn 1875 1880 export u.s cotton good increase time compare 1871 1875 estimate conclude 20 percent manufacture export u.s cotton good industry survive 1887 1897 domestic market agonize weight depression textile export china rise 120 percent foreign domestic policy implication understand southern textile representative example unsuccessfully oppose 1882 act exclude chinese immigrant united state year china cut import retaliation congressman hernando d. money mississippi observe 1876 “ march empire westward ” “ people enjoy asiatic commerce grow rich prosperous ” united state possess hawaii way station asian markets.6,202,"[1840, 1871, 1900, 1873, 1882, 1876]",1874,6,1875,1900

By 1912, Duke had grown so powerful in China’s seemingly bottomless cigarette market that both the Chinese government and Japanese competitors declared economic war on him.

Not unnaturally, such Southerners as Senator John T. Morgan of Alabama led the fight for the building of an isthmian canal (to which Mobile, New Orleans, and other regional ports would have a geographical advantage). Southerners might have had an aversion to the federal government’s interference before 1860, but by the 1880s they demanded that Washington provide a canal, a merchant fleet, better diplomatic service, and other amenities necessary for survival in the global marketplace. The Chattanooga Tradesman, which spoke for much of the South’s business community, was revealing. Latin American “trade is ours by natural laws,” it trumpeted in 1888, but then the paper felt it best to buttress God’s laws by adding, “and a wise and liberal policy on the part of our government will secure it.”8","['1860', 'the 1880s', '1888']",south ’s producer dependent latin asian customer chattanooga tradesman worry build factory depend wholly export trade unnaturally southerner senator john t. morgan alabama lead fight building isthmian canal mobile new orlean regional port geographical advantage southerner aversion federal government ’s interference 1860 1880 demand washington provide canal merchant fleet good diplomatic service amenity necessary survival global marketplace chattanooga tradesman speak south ’s business community reveal latin “ trade natural law ” trumpet 1888 paper feel good buttress god ’s law add “ wise liberal policy government secure it.”8,88,"[1860, 1880, 1888]",1876,3,1900,1900

373,"The story of the era was told in three sets of figures. One set revealed that in 1860 U.S. imports amounted to $354 million and exports to $316 million, thus producing a deficit balance of merchandise trade. By 1897 imports had doubled to $765 million, but exports more than tripled to $1.03 billion (U.S. billion). After 1874, exports surpassed imports every year except 1875, 1888, and 1893, until the turn downward after 1971. Two hundred years of unfavorably balanced American trade reversed course in the 1870s, and the United States headed for world economic supremacy. The second set of figures showed that the U.S. share of world trade was 6 percent in 1868 but 11 percent in 1913. The increase was almost entirely in industrial products, so much so that the United States, it was said, had replaced Great Britain as the “workshop of the world.” The American invasion, one Britisher wrote, “goes on unceasingly and without noise or show in five hundred industries at once. From shaving soap to electric motors … the American is clearing the field.” The third set of figures showed that in 1880, 84.3 percent of all goods exported were agricultural, but by 1900 agriculture accounted for only two-thirds of all exports. Again, after three hundred years, the United States was becoming an industrial, urbanized nation instead of an agrarian country.10","['1860', '1897', '1874', 'every year', '1875, 1888', '1893', '1971', 'Two hundred years', 'the 1870s', '1868', '1913', '1880', 'three hundred years']",story era tell set figure set reveal 1860 u.s import amount 354 million export 316 million produce deficit balance merchandise trade 1897 import double 765 million export triple 1.03 billion u.s billion 1874 export surpass import year 1875 1888 1893 turn downward 1971 year unfavorably balanced trade reverse course 1870s united state head world economic supremacy second set figure show u.s share world trade 6 percent 1868 11 percent 1913 increase entirely industrial product united state say replace great britain “ workshop world ” invasion britisher write “ go unceasingly noise industry shave soap electric motor … clear field ” set figure show 1880 84.3 percent good export agricultural 1900 agriculture account third export year united state industrial urbanized nation instead agrarian country.10,123,"[1860, 1897, 1874, 1893, 1971, 1870, 1868, 1913, 1880]",1892,9,1900,1900
374,"Farmers did not go into decline quietly. Between 1870 and 1900 more U.S. land was settled (430 million acres) than in all the previous three hundred years (407 million acres). Mechanization produced gigantic staple-crop farms, such as the wheat-producing facilities encompassing thousands of acres in the Red River Valley area. Between 1870 and 1910 the doubling of the nation’s population provided an ever-growing market for producers. Yet farmers suffered severely. By the 1890s the Red River Valley giants had virtually disappeared, thousands of farmers left homesteads in the Plains states, and farm tenancy and foreclosures reached historic highs. Despite the huge domestic market, 20 percent of agricultural production had to find foreign markets. These markets could be tapped best by highly mechanized and capitalized producers, and even they met tough competition from Russian wheat, and Latin American wheat and meat producers, as well as the determination of such imperial powers as Germany and France to become as self-sufficient as possible by subsidizing domestic producers or developing their colonies’ agriculture. The ever alert Chattanooga Tradesman noted during the depths of the 1893 economic crash that Southerners were producing more cotton than ever, but so were Russians, Latin Americans, and Egyptians. The prices of cotton and wheat in particular were not set in New York or Chicago, but in London financial markets. Wheat, as well as cotton, growers in the United States demanded Washington’s help in opening Latin American markets, in part because they were trying to pull free of London’s hold. The government did little, but in the 1890s it created a bureau in the Department of Agriculture that acted as a clearinghouse for information on foreign markets.11","['Between 1870 and 1900', 'the previous three hundred years', 'Between 1870 and 1910', 'the 1890s', '1893', 'the 1890s']",farmer decline quietly 1870 1900 u.s land settle 430 million acre previous year 407 million acre mechanization produce gigantic staple crop farm wheat produce facility encompass thousand acre red river valley area 1870 1910 doubling nation ’s population provide grow market producer farmer suffer severely 1890s red river valley giant virtually disappear thousand farmer leave homestead plain state farm tenancy foreclosure reach historic high despite huge domestic market 20 percent agricultural production find foreign market market tap best highly mechanized capitalize producer meet tough competition russian wheat latin wheat meat producer determination imperial power germany france self sufficient possible subsidize domestic producer develop colonies’ agriculture alert chattanooga tradesman note depth 1893 economic crash southerner produce cotton russian latin american egyptian price cotton wheat particular set new york chicago london financial market wheat cotton grower united state demand washington ’s help open latin market try pull free london ’s hold government little 1890s create bureau department agriculture act clearinghouse information foreign markets.11,161,"[1890, 1893, 1890]",1891,3,1900,1900

The one escape route that had served in the past, moreover, was closing: With the official announcement by the Bureau of the Census in 1890 that the American frontier line had finally disappeared after four hundred years, it dawned on observers that the best and most accessible land was disappearing. Others had long drawn the conclusion. An 1886 article in the widely read North American Review, for example, noted the exploding population, the rise of farm tenancy, and the similarities of America’s problems and ancient Rome’s decline (a favorite subject of these years), and then lamented, “The pressure has already come. For all practical purposes, the public domain of the United States is now exhausted.” Novelist Harold Frederic was more explicit: “Farmers’ wives continued to break down and die under the strain, or to be drafted off to the lunatic asylum; the farmers kept hanging themselves in their barns, or flying westward before the locust-like cloud of mortgages; the boys and girls turned their steps townward in an ever-increasing host.” Jefferson’s ideal farm family seemed to be turning into international chattels.12","['1890', 'four hundred years', '1886', 'these years']",course insufficient escape route serve past close official announcement bureau census 1890 frontier line finally disappear year dawn observer good accessible land disappear long draw conclusion 1886 article widely read north review example note explode population rise farm tenancy similarity america ’s problem ancient rome ’s decline favorite subject year lament “ pressure come practical purpose public domain united state exhausted ” novelist harold frederic explicit “ farmers’ wife continue break die strain draft lunatic asylum farmer keep hang barn fly westward locust like cloud mortgage boy girl turn step townward increase host ” jefferson ’s ideal farm family turn international chattels.12,102,"[1890, 1886]",1888,2,1900,1900

377,"Three domestic events turned this stream of the 1880s into the post-1895 flood of American economic invaders so dreaded by Europeans. The first was the 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act, which forbade agreements in restraint of trade. Some of its sponsors hoped the measure would restore competition at home. It instead drove competitors to cut competition by merging. Between 1897 and 1904, not only did the greatest corporate merger movement in the nation’s history occur, but these new giants actively moved overseas. A second event was the success of gold-standard advocates in ending the bitter debate over silver coinage in the 1890s and stabilizing the currency on gold. Some Americans had hoped that the British and French would lead an international effort to reach a more inflationary bimetalist agreement (i.e., coinage of more silver). These efforts collapsed, and when the post-1893 crash threatened American overseas exports and investments, the so-called goldbugs made their move. President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, modified the 1890 Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Then Republican president William McKinley, after triumphing over silverite William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 election, pounded the final golden nail in silver’s coffin by championing the Gold Standard Act in 1900. Corporations invested abroad with the certain knowledge that the monetary question had been decided at home, and they could deal with certainty with the other gold standard nations, above all, Great Britain.14","['the 1880s', '1890', 'Between 1897 and 1904', 'the 1890s', 'post-1893', '1896', '1900']",domestic event turn stream 1880s post-1895 flood economic invader dread europeans 1890 sherman anti trust act forbid agreement restraint trade sponsor hop measure restore competition home instead drive competitor cut competition merge 1897 1904 great corporate merger movement nation ’s history occur new giant actively move overseas second event success gold standard advocate end bitter debate silver coinage 1890s stabilize currency gold american hop british french lead international effort reach inflationary bimetalist agreement i.e. coinage silver effort collapse post-1893 crash threaten overseas export investment call goldbug president grover cleveland democrat modify 1890 sherman silver purchase act republican president william mckinley triumph silverite william jennings bryan 1896 election pound final golden nail silver ’s coffin champion gold standard act 1900 corporation invest abroad certain knowledge monetary question decide home deal certainty gold standard nation great britain.14,135,"[1880, 1890, 1890, 1893, 1896, 1900]",1892,6,1900,1900
378,"The goldbugs thus refused to agree that the economic crisis could be solved by manipulating the money supply. They argued instead that the crisis was due to overproduction and that by finding new overseas markets U.S. producers could maintain their competitiveness and prosper. Very few in government considered using federal authority to redistribute income, especially after 1895, when the Supreme Court killed an attempt to impose an income tax. The growing consensus around overproduction as the explanation for the crisis led Americans to search for buyers abroad. But to compete abroad required ruthless cost cutting at home. The cycle seemed closed.15",['1895'],goldbug refuse agree economic crisis solve manipulate money supply argue instead crisis overproduction find new overseas market u.s producer maintain competitiveness prosper government consider federal authority redistribute income especially 1895 supreme court kill attempt impose income tax grow consensus overproduction explanation crisis lead american search buyer abroad compete abroad require ruthless cost cutting home cycle closed.15,56,[1895],1895,1,1900,1900
379,"Thus appeared the third important influence on the multinationals’ development: the twenty-five-year depression itself. This crisis did not cut production. The opposite occurred. In both the farm and the industrial sectors, production soared until gluts of goods threatened to suffocate the system. Prices steadily fell. If the 1873 price index is taken as 100, it plummeted to 78 by 1890 and to 71 by 1896. This decline meant that only the most efficient survived, which meant, in turn, that those with the needed capital to purchase the new technology could produce most cheaply and weather the economic storms. Those storms overhung most of the post-1873 Western industrializing world. In the 1880s alone, production of steel doubled in France, tripled in Great Britain, and quintupled in Germany and the United States. Between 1873 and 1886 the world’s supply of cotton shot up 50 percent; in 1890–1 the United States alone produced three million more bales than the entire world could consume.

380,"Amid this twenty-five years of boom hidden in twenty-five years of bust, the United States rode one of the worst economic crises to the peak of world economic power. The price immediately paid was disorder, indeed the threat of class-driven revolutionary outbreaks, which were previously little known in the United States. The 1870s witnessed the birth of the first American socialist party. Influenced by the Paris Commune of 1871, its organization demonstrated that not only cotton prices were susceptible to events in the international arena. In 1877 the nation’s first general strike threatened to paralyze the country. Generated by railway problems, the strike resulted in one hundred strikers being killed as the movement spread across West Virginia into the Midwest. The judge in Indianapolis who moved to end the strike was Walter Quintin Gresham. “Our revolutionary fathers … went too far with their notions of popular government,” Gresham wrote a friend. “Democracy is now the enemy of law and order and society itself and as such should be denounced. I wish Grant was President.” (In 1893 Gresham became secretary of state under President Grover Cleveland.) Many others also wanted Grant, a man on horseback, to have a third presidential term and end this “Communism and currency inflation,” as one supporter phrased the problem. The crises had merely begun. Chicago’s Haymarket Riot of 1886, the Homestead strike of 1892, and Cleveland’s use of federal troops to break Chicago strikes in 1894 were only the most visible outbreaks of the long depression.17","['this twenty-five years', 'twenty-five years', '1870s', '1877', '1893', '1892', '1894']",amid year boom hide year bust united state ride bad economic crisis peak world economic power price immediately pay disorder threat class drive revolutionary outbreak previously little known united state 1870s witness birth socialist party influence paris commune 1871 organization demonstrate cotton price susceptible event international arena 1877 nation ’s general strike threaten paralyze country generate railway problem strike result striker kill movement spread west virginia midwest judge indianapoli move end strike walter quintin gresham “ revolutionary father … go far notion popular government ” gresham write friend “ democracy enemy law order society denounce wish grant president ” 1893 gresham secretary state president grover cleveland want grant man horseback presidential term end “ communism currency inflation ” supporter phrase problem crisis merely begin chicago ’s haymarket riot 1886 homestead strike 1892 cleveland ’s use federal troop break chicago strike 1894 visible outbreak long depression.17,145,"[1870, 1877, 1893, 1892, 1894]",1885,5,1900,1900

As a Cleveland judge said in 1893, the new local armory was to be “an impregnable fortress …, a refuge and sanctuary …, in times of public commotion.”18 Others, such as Carnegie and Rockefeller, were making the United States the world’s leading power while also making such armories necessary.","['the mid-1870s', '1893']",need compete international marketplace cause bloodshed domestic marketplace react strike mid-1870 search immediately armory serve fortress training ground local militia protect cities’ middle class angry worker immigrant cleveland judge say 1893 new local armory “ impregnable fortress … refuge sanctuary … time public commotion.”18 carnegie rockefeller make united state world ’s lead power make armory necessary,56,"[1870, 1893]",1882,2,1900,1900

He found fresh markets in the machine and construction industries and, not least, in the U.S. and foreign navies, which were building armor-plated war fleets. Steelmakers also found markets in Russia where the vast Trans-Siberian Railway, as well as the nation’s navy, was being built.

By 1890, however, the industry had become so efficient that the tariffs began to drop. The focus was shifting. As Carnegie noted in 1895, he now wanted lower tariffs so that the United States could obtain cheaper raw materials from countries that would then lower their tariffs for American goods. The tariff policy for the United States was moving into the twentieth century.20","['1870', 'each year', '1890', '1895']",carnegie later admit 1870 tariff protect iron steel producer time major reason enter steel business producer give generously protectionist politician understandably observer estimate federal government ’s help give steel industrialist add profit 7 million 25 million year 1890 industry efficient tariff begin drop focus shift carnegie note 1895 want low tariff united state obtain cheap raw material country lower tariff good tariff policy united state move twentieth century.20,68,"[1870, 1890, 1895]",1885,3,1900,1900
384,"Other than discovering how to make money from economic crises and behind tariff walls, Carnegie made another major contribution. He saw that he could be most competitive by systematically integrating his operations vertically so that he could control the product from the iron-ore range of Minnesota and the coal of Pennsylvania through the furnaces of Pittsburgh. Such integration and new technology required so much capital and other overhead that these costs could best be paid off by continually running full or, as Carnegie phrased it, “running hard.” His “law of surplus” required that his plants “run hard” even when few markets were in sight. Carnegie thus produced more goods, at lower and lower cost, and then undersold other competitors in the market. Taking a temporary loss was preferred to closing down the expensive furnaces. Between 1888 and 1898 the largest increase in U.S. exports thus occurred in iron and steel; in 1888 they amounted to $17.7 million, and ten years later to $40 million. This 230 percent jump by 1898 also gave Americans a favorable trade balance of $30 million in these goods. Economist Edward Atkinson observed at the end of 1897 that “the portentous event of the year has been the recognition … that the paramount dominion in the making of iron and steel has passed from the other side of the Atlantic to this country.” The nation that controls the iron and steel markets at the cheapest price and yet pays high wages, Atkinson concluded, “may control the commerce of the world” whenever it decides to follow a freer trade policy.21","['Between 1888 and 1898', '1888', 'ten years later', '1898', 'the end of 1897', 'the year']",discover money economic crisis tariff wall carnegie major contribution see competitive systematically integrate operation vertically control product iron ore range minnesota coal pennsylvania furnace pittsburgh integration new technology require capital overhead cost best pay continually run carnegie phrase “ run hard “ law surplus ” require plant “ run hard ” market sight carnegie produce good low low cost undersell competitor market take temporary loss prefer close expensive furnace 1888 1898 large increase u.s export occur iron steel 1888 amount 17.7 million year later 40 million 230 percent jump 1898 give american favorable trade balance 30 million good economist edward atkinson observe end 1897 “ portentous event year recognition … paramount dominion making iron steel pass atlantic country ” nation control iron steel market cheap price pay high wage atkinson conclude “ control commerce world ” decide follow free trade policy.21,141,"[1888, 1898, 1897]",1894,3,1900,1900
385,"When the tsar’s government began building the Trans-Siberian across Russia in 1892, U.S. steelmakers envisioned a limitless market. By the mid-1890s iron and steel goods were replacing cotton as the most important U.S. export to Russia. Steel rails, Baldwin locomotives, bridges, and cars moved into Siberia as Americans underbid other producers. Count Sergei Witte, the political godfather of the Trans-Siberian, grasped the meaning of all this for diplomacy. After nearly a century of friendship, U.S.-Russian relations were cooling, especially as the two powers competed for ascendancy in China. Witte went out of his way to buy American and assure U.S. producers he wanted a good relationship. Carnegie’s initiative in the early 1870s was helping to shape the world’s power balance by the late 1890s.22","['1892', 'the mid-1890s', 'nearly a century', 'the early 1870s']",tsar ’s government begin build trans siberian russia 1892 u.s steelmaker envision limitless market mid-1890 iron steel good replace cotton important u.s export russia steel rail baldwin locomotive bridge car move siberia american underbid producer count sergei witte political godfather trans siberian grasp meaning diplomacy nearly century friendship u.s .- russian relation cool especially power compete ascendancy china witte go way buy assure u.s producer want good relationship carnegie ’s initiative early 1870s help shape world ’s power balance late 1890s.22,81,"[1892, 1890, 1870]",1884,3,1900,1900
386,"In 1886, Carnegie published Triumphant Democracy, which argued that his law of surplus, among other capitalist principles, was as good for democracy as it would become for Russian railroads. The nation’s democracy had produced the new Industrial Revolution, and it, in turn, had provided the wherewithal to reinforce individual freedom. Capitalism produced democracy as well as, and because of, profits. Carnegie’s message reached British thinkers, who were mulling the problem of how to maintain democratic institutions amid their growing empire. They did not want to follow Rome’s history of losing liberty to empire. The English Imperial Federation movement of the 1880s believed the United States federal system provided the model. Libertas et imperium could be reconciled, it was decided, by “the United States of the Britannic Empire.” Or, as one believer declared, “What [Americans] have done, we can do. The Americans are a generation before us in the growth of democracy.”23 Carnegie agreed, although having been born in Scotland, he constantly both condemned the British Empire and warned Americans not to follow the British example of imperium. America’s democracy appeared to be as seductive as its steel. Of course, Carnegie could argue that they were simply two sides of the same system.","['1886', 'the 1880s']",1886 carnegie publish triumphant democracy argue law surplus capitalist principle good democracy russian railroad nation ’s democracy produce new industrial revolution turn provide wherewithal reinforce individual freedom capitalism produce democracy profit carnegie ’s message reach british thinker mull problem maintain democratic institution amid grow empire want follow rome ’s history lose liberty empire english imperial federation movement 1880s believe united state federal system provide model libertas et imperium reconcile decide “ united state britannic empire ” believer declare “ american american generation growth democracy.”23 carnegie agree have bear scotland constantly condemn british empire warn american follow british example imperium america ’s democracy appear seductive steel course carnegie argue simply side system,111,"[1886, 1880]",1883,2,1900,1900
387,"Carnegie was doing well while doing good. He was one of many iron and steel producers, but he usually turned out one-quarter of the nation’s product. By the 1890s his works enjoyed a $40 million annual profit. His workers were less happy. They labored around some of the hottest areas on the face of the earth and for twenty-four hours at a time when shifts changed. The horrendous conditions had helped labor organizers build one of the strongest unions in the new American Federation of Labor, at Carnegie’s Homestead Plant outside Pittsburgh. In 1892 the members demanded wages that matched their increased productivity.24","['the 1890s', 'annual', '1892']",carnegie good iron steel producer usually turn quarter nation ’s product 1890s work enjoy 40 million annual profit worker happy labor hot area face earth hour time shift change horrendous condition help labor organizer build strong union new federation labor carnegie ’s homestead plant outside pittsburgh 1892 member demand wage match increase productivity.24,53,"[1890, 1892]",1891,2,1900,1900

In mid-1892 warfare erupted. Nine Pinkertons and seven laborers died. The state governor sent in the militia to protect the nonunion laborers.25 The strike was broken and Homestead again abided by the law of running hard.

389,"In order to “run full,” Carnegie had by 1892 also compromised another of his beliefs. In 1881, the U.S. navy was a pathetic fleet whose five major ships were a quarter-century old and obsolete. Since 1865 British plants had built the world’s greatest navy with armorplate as thick as 12 inches. The next year, 1882, Congress appropriated funds to build four modern warships, and, without much prompting, gave preference to domestic steelmakers. (Humorist Finley Peter Dunne, or “Mr. Dooley,” later observed that a secretary of the navy’s first qualification was that he not have seen saltwater outside a pork barrel.) Carnegie was of two minds. With a strong pacifist streak, he bragged in Triumphant Democracy that the great American power was not military: “Her navy, thank God! is as nothing.” When Washington officials asked him to bid on warship contracts he told his wife he would not do so; she said she was proud of him. After more pressure from the navy and his steel partners, he decided to make only armorplate, not guns. (He and the partners realized there might be “millions for us in armor.”) By 1890 Carnegie was not only taking over contracts earlier given to his competition but also building special plants to produce the world’s best armor. He had placed his own agents in the U.S. Navy Department to give him inside information on construction plans so that he could underbid competition. By the 1890s, Carnegie and Bethlehem Iron Works stopped bidding and simply split contracts. He was now producing armor at $175 per ton and selling it to the U.S. government at $450. Accused of exploiting his adopted homeland (and of selling it some defective goods), Carnegie indignantly refused to bid on contracts in the mid-1890s – at least until the price was right.26","['1892', '1881', 'a quarter-century old', '1865', 'The next year', '1882', '1890', 'the 1890s', 'the mid-1890s –']",order “ run ” carnegie 1892 compromise belief 1881 u.s navy pathetic fleet major ship quarter century old obsolete 1865 british plant build world ’s great navy armorplate thick 12 inch year 1882 congress appropriate fund build modern warship prompting give preference domestic steelmaker humorist finley peter dunne “ mr dooley ” later observe secretary navy ’s qualification see saltwater outside pork barrel carnegie mind strong pacifist streak brag triumphant democracy great power military “ navy thank god ” washington official ask bid warship contract tell wife say proud pressure navy steel partner decide armorplate gun partner realize “ million armor ” 1890 carnegie take contract earlier give competition build special plant produce world ’s good armor place agent u.s navy department inside information construction plan underbid competition 1890s carnegie bethlehem iron work stop bid simply split contract produce armor 175 ton sell u.s government 450 accuse exploit adopt homeland sell defective good carnegie indignantly refuse bid contract mid-1890 – price right.26,162,"[1892, 1881, 1865, 1882, 1890, 1890, 1890]",1884,7,1900,1900
390,"He quickly found foreign markets. In 1891 he worked through Secretary of State James G. Blaine to take Russian navy contracts for armorplate away from the British. By 1898, he was dividing this Russian market, as well as other overseas sales of armor, with friends. The U.S. navy was not pleased when it heard that Carnegie was selling armor to the Russians for $249 per ton, or about half the price paid by Americans. The steelmaker was unrepentant. As the powers began to build the great fleets that would fight World War I, the profits became so attractive – especially amid the economic crisis of 1893 to 1896 – that Carnegie wanted to begin making gun forgings as well. His partners refused because the profits did not promise to be high enough. Others instead developed the new generation of highly efficient weapons, including rifles and machine guns, that revolutionized warfare. The new technology was made possible by the new steelmaking processes.27","['1891', '1898', '–', '1893 to 1896 –']",quickly find foreign market 1891 work secretary state james g. blaine russian navy contract armorplate away british 1898 divide russian market overseas sale armor friend u.s navy pleased hear carnegie sell armor russian 249 ton half price pay american steelmaker unrepentant power begin build great fleet fight world war profit attractive – especially amid economic crisis 1893 1896 – carnegie want begin make gun forging partner refuse profit promise high instead develop new generation highly efficient weapon include rifle machine gun revolutionize warfare new technology possible new steelmaking processes.27,89,"[1891, 1898]",1894,2,1900,1900
391,"In 1898–9 Carnegie financed the fight against President McKinley’s annexation of the Philippines. In a gesture that was appropriate in fin de siècle America, the steel magnate stormed Washington to offer $20 million to buy the islands himself so that he could give them their independence, thus sparing the United States the ignominy of resembling the British Empire. But he by no means opposed expansion. Carnegie accepted the taking of Hawaii. In 1898, he wrote, “I am no ‘Little’ American, afraid of growth … provided always that the new territory be American and that it will produce Americans and not foreign races bound in time to be false to the Republic in order to be true to themselves.”28 Seward would have agreed, not least with the racial views, as he would have applauded the new U.S. war fleet and the conquest of Russia’s industrial markets.

392,"By 1902, the United States was producing more iron and steel than Great Britain and Germany combined. Production of primary steel, moreover, was more centralized in the United States than in either Great Britain or Germany. In 1901, Carnegie sold his firm to a combination led by J. P. Morgan who (in part with stock-deal hocus-pocus) put together U.S. Steel, the earth’s first billion-dollar corporation. Only John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Corporation approached it. Rockefeller developed the industry that first helped light that world of steel and then fueled the machines, including the modern navies, that Carnegie had helped build. Instead of selling out to a banker, Rockefeller became his own so that he would have the resources to compete, especially with Russian oil. For while Carnegie sold to the Russians, Rockefeller was fighting what German authors called the new thirty years’ war against Russia’s powerful financial supporter, the Rothschilds of Paris.","['1902', '1901']",1902 united state produce iron steel great britain germany combine production primary steel centralized united state great britain germany 1901 carnegie sell firm combination lead j. p. morgan stock deal hocus pocus u.s steel earth ’s billion dollar corporation john d. rockefeller ’s standard oil corporation approach rockefeller develop industry help light world steel fuel machine include modern navy carnegie help build instead sell banker rockefeller resource compete especially russian oil carnegie sell russian rockefeller fight german author call new thirty years’ war russia ’s powerful financial supporter rothschild paris,90,"[1902, 1901]",1902,2,1925,1950
393,"Already the globe’s greatest oil refining operation in 1870, Standard had gained power by expanding U.S. petroleum production (1 million barrels in 1866, 20 million in 1896), while John D. Rockefeller’s ruthless business practices shaved costs, rationalized production, and drove out competition. In the 1890s Standard still did about 80 percent of the nation’s refining. By then, however, its product was changing. As electrification spread over Europe and the United States, the company’s primary product, kerosene, found outlets primarily in Asia, especially China. But simultaneously, new engines to drive warships, factory machines, and the automobile demanded oil and gasoline. The engines grew miraculously. The largest exhibited at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair had 35 horsepower, but at the Paris Exposition seven years later the largest generated 1,000 horsepower.29","['1870', '1866', '1896', 'the 1890s', 'seven years later']","globe ’s great oil refining operation 1870 standard gain power expand u.s petroleum production 1 million barrel 1866 20 million 1896 john d. rockefeller ’s ruthless business practice shave cost rationalize production drive competition 1890s standard 80 percent nation ’s refining product change electrification spread europe united state company ’s primary product kerosene find outlet primarily asia especially china simultaneously new engine drive warship factory machine automobile demand oil gasoline engine grow miraculously large exhibit 1893 chicago world ’s fair 35 horsepower paris exposition seven year later large generate 1,000 horsepower.29",91,"[1870, 1866, 1896, 1890]",1880,4,1900,1900
394,"From the 1860s to the 1880s, three-quarters of Standard’s main product, kerosene, required overseas markets. Rockefeller linked American oil fields to the Atlantic seacoast with pipeline and then concentrated his refining at Bayonne, New Jersey. From there the product was shipped, first to Europe (especially Germany and Great Britain into the 1880s) and then increasingly to Asia. Petroleum products were the fourth-largest U.S. export in value. William Herbert Libby, who after 1878 was Standard’s top foreign agent, bragged that petroleum “forced its way into more nooks and corners of civilized and uncivilized countries than any other product in business history emanating from a single source.” By the 1890s the refined liquid went to towns and villages from Siam to Sumatra to Borneo to all parts of Latin America and Canada, as well as to Europe, parts of Africa, Japan, and China.30","['the 1860s', 'the 1880s', 'three-quarters', 'the 1880s', '1878', 'the 1890s']",1860s 1880s quarter standard ’s main product kerosene require overseas market rockefeller link oil field atlantic seacoast pipeline concentrate refining bayonne new jersey product ship europe especially germany great britain 1880s increasingly asia petroleum product fourth large u.s export value william herbert libby 1878 standard ’s foreign agent brag petroleum “ force way nook corner civilized uncivilized country product business history emanate single source ” 1890s refined liquid go town village siam sumatra borneo part latin america canada europe part africa japan china.30,83,"[1860, 1880, 1880, 1878, 1890]",1878,5,1900,1900
395,"In the 1880s, however, oil began streaming from the Caucasus until by 1891 Russian gushers produced nearly 38 percent of world petroleum. The Nobels of Sweden first organized Russian kerosene production, and then the powerful Rothschilds moved in. A fierce battle for the domination of world markets broke out between the French-Russian group and Standard Oil. Rockefeller formed his own marketing companies (instead of depending on independent foreign oil buyers) and tightly run distribution points that spread over Canada, Great Britain, the West Indies, and Germany, among other locales. A huge fleet of tankers was built to speed the product out of Bayonne. In the United States, new, cheaper oil was found and more cheaply refined. By the mid-1890s Standard had lost markets in Austria-Hungary, Spain, Turkey, and, of course, Russia, but more than held its own elsewhere. Russian-American oil competition exemplified an ominous, growing animosity and competition between the two nations, which had once – notably in the 1860s – been good friends.31","['the 1880s', '1891', 'the mid-1890s', 'once –', 'the 1860s –']",1880 oil begin stream caucasus 1891 russian gusher produce nearly 38 percent world petroleum nobel sweden organize russian kerosene production powerful rothschild move fierce battle domination world market break french russian group standard oil rockefeller form marketing company instead depend independent foreign oil buyer tightly run distribution point spread canada great britain west indie germany locale huge fleet tanker build speed product bayonne united state new cheap oil find cheaply refined mid-1890 standard lose market austria hungary spain turkey course russia hold russian oil competition exemplify ominous grow animosity competition nation – notably 1860s – good friends.31,97,"[1880, 1891, 1890, 1860]",1880,4,1900,1900

The fight was difficult, but Standard’s Asian operations always made a profit, despite the Rothschilds and the Royal Dutch powerhouse that was developing in the East Indies. Libby spent years in China opening up interior markets and combating native vegetable and peanut oil competitors. He was helped by U.S. consuls and other diplomats who were under State Department instruction to clear paths for petroleum sales, especially by getting restrictive ordinances and regulations rescinded. Of special importance were to be the British, French, and Argentine markets. By 1914 Henry Ford had already set up a Model T assembly plant in Argentina. Standard also used its political network in Washington to help protect these present and potential markets. By 1900, Rockefeller could use his own private diplomatic service, as well as his country’s, as he fueled the world’s internal combustion engines and lighted the lamps of China.32","['between 1884 and 1894', 'years', '1914', '1900']",western pacific theater 1884 1894 u.s petroleum shipment hong kong australia new zealand triple japan rise 50 percent fight difficult standard ’s asian operation profit despite rothschild royal dutch powerhouse develop east indie libby spend year china opening interior market combat native vegetable peanut oil competitor help u.s consul diplomat state department instruction clear path petroleum sale especially get restrictive ordinance regulation rescind special importance british french argentine market 1914 henry ford set model t assembly plant argentina standard political network washington help protect present potential market 1900 rockefeller use private diplomatic service country ’s fuel world ’s internal combustion engine light lamp china.32,104,"[1914, 1900]",1907,2,1925,1950
397,"In late 1897, the influential New York Journal of Commerce reviewed the decade, noted the enormous growth of the nation’s overseas trade, and listed three major causes for that growth: the post-1893 collapse of the home market; the drastic reductions in cost, especially in raw materials and from volume manufacturing rather than using increased labor; and the rapid rise of the manufacturing sector’s competitiveness. In 1895, the Journal of Commerce had preached that the new Industrial Revolution made Americans “a part of ‘abroad.’” No one could any longer “imagine that we can maintain ourselves in isolation from the rest of the commercial world.”33 Nor could Americans at home remain isolated. Many of the firms that used railways to invade towns with the products of the new technology were also the firms that were carrying out a commercial invasion as well in towns and cities globally.","['late 1897', 'the decade', 'post-1893', '1895']",late 1897 influential new york journal commerce review decade note enormous growth nation ’s overseas trade list major cause growth post-1893 collapse home market drastic reduction cost especially raw material volume manufacture increase labor rapid rise manufacturing sector ’s competitiveness 1895 journal commerce preach new industrial revolution american “ ‘ abroad.’ ” longer “ imagine maintain isolation rest commercial world.”33 american home remain isolated firm railway invade town product new technology firm carry commercial invasion town city globally,78,"[1897, 1893, 1895]",1895,3,1900,1900
398,"The capitalism that shaped late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century America depended less on order than it did on profit and market share. As Homestead’s bloodshed demonstrated, the law of surplus and running hard at the cheapest cost proved of greater importance to Frick and Carnegie than order and labor peace. To survive the economic depression that haunted the post-1873 years, and to survive the kind of cutthroat competition in the international marketplace that was waged by Carnegie against British steel, Rockefeller against Russian oil, and Southern textile owners against New England manufacturers required not order, but cheap labor, cheap capital, and hard-driving managers. The United States produced all three in abundance; it thus became the world’s leading economic power while enduring two decades of labor riots and massive dislocations.","['early twentieth-century', 'the post-1873 years', 'two decades']",capitalism shape late nineteenth- early twentieth century america depend order profit market share homestead ’s bloodshed demonstrate law surplus run hard cheap cost prove great importance frick carnegie order labor peace survive economic depression haunt post-1873 year survive kind cutthroat competition international marketplace wag carnegie british steel rockefeller russian oil southern textile owner new england manufacturer require order cheap labor cheap capital hard drive manager united state produce abundance world ’s lead economic power endure decade labor riot massive dislocation,80,[1873],1873,1,1875,1900
399,"Such an understanding of this generation’s priorities helps explain as well two myths that shaped the thought of the era but had considerably less to do with the actual politics, economics, or diplomacy: the myth of laissez-faireism and the myth of social Darwinism. Nowhere, not even in Carnegie’s Scottish castle, was the laissez-faire myth stronger than in the South. As historian C. Vann Woodward wrote of the era, “Laissez faire became almost a test of Southern patriotism.” Given the South’s bitter experience with the Washington-imposed Reconstruction measures, the feeling was understandable. But the same belief permeated the North’s views as well, as illustrated by the group of businesspeople and educators who in 1880 organized the Society of Political Education to fight “the growing tendency of government to enlarge its sphere.”35 Carnegie and Rockefeller doubtless added “amen” to such sentiments (after, of course, benefiting handsomely from government-imposed tariffs and government-subsidized railroads). The reality was even subtler. The largest and best capitalized industrialists could set up their own assured capital supply, create their own foreign service corps to seek out markets and remove political obstacles, and even hire their own riot forces. Even Carnegie, however, had to manipulate the tariff for his own interest. So did Standard Oil. In 1894 and 1897 tariff legislation, Congress added provisions that retaliated against nations that discriminated against U.S. petroleum exports.36","['1880', '1894', '1897']",understanding generation ’s priority help explain myth shape thought era considerably actual politic economic diplomacy myth laissez faireism myth social darwinism carnegie ’s scottish castle laissez faire myth strong south historian c. vann woodward write era “ laissez faire test southern patriotism ” give south ’s bitter experience washington impose reconstruction measure feeling understandable belief permeate north ’s view illustrate group businesspeople educator 1880 organize society political education fight “ grow tendency government enlarge sphere.”35 carnegie rockefeller doubtless add “ amen ” sentiment course benefit handsomely government impose tariff government subsidize railroad reality subtle large best capitalize industrialist set assure capital supply create foreign service corp seek market remove political obstacle hire riot force carnegie manipulate tariff interest standard oil 1894 1897 tariff legislation congress add provision retaliate nation discriminate u.s petroleum exports.36,133,"[1880, 1894, 1897]",1890,3,1900,1900
400,"An effective foreign policy requires centralization – centralized control and direction of policy, and the threat of effective use of concentrated force. The apparent paradox of the late nineteenth century was that as American society became more disorderly, the federal government became more orderly and centralized. The paradox is only apparent. As disorder spread after 1873, corporate leaders urged stronger action, especially at the executive level, to arrest troublemakers at home and to help remove the riots’ causes by helping business find markets abroad. The changing interrelationships of business and foreign policy began to change as well the balance of power within the U.S. governmental system. Young Henry Adams had accurately forecast the changes as he looked about the United States in 1870: “Under the conditions of 50 years, when the United States was a mere child among nations, and even before railways and telegraphs had concentrated the social and economic forces of the country into a power never imagined by past generations, a loose and separately responsible division of government suited the stage of national growth…. All indications now point to the conclusion that this system is outgrown.”38","['the late nineteenth century', '1873', '1870', '50 years']",effective foreign policy require centralization – centralize control direction policy threat effective use concentrated force apparent paradox late nineteenth century society disorderly federal government orderly centralized paradox apparent disorder spread 1873 corporate leader urge strong action especially executive level arrest troublemaker home help remove riots’ cause help business find market abroad change interrelationship business foreign policy begin change balance power u.s governmental system young henry adams accurately forecast change look united state 1870 “ condition 50 year united state mere child nation railway telegraphs concentrate social economic force country power imagine past generation loose separately responsible division government suit stage national growth … indication point conclusion system outgrown.”38,108,"[1873, 1870]",1872,2,1875,1900
401,"The ideology tried to keep up with these changes. The 1865–1900 era, bound at one end by Karl Marx’s Das Kapital and Charles Darwin’s Descent of Man and at the other by the writings of James and Freud, had an intellectual ferment unsurpassed by other thirty-five-year periods. American Manifest Destiny remained a ringing cry, but now it was proclaimed by the journal Age of Steel in regard to export trade rather than, as in the 1840s, by Young America expansionists who demanded taking all of Mexico. Even President Ulysses S. Grant no doubt stunned French officials in 1870 when he congratulated them on establishing the Third Republic and then added, “We cannot be indifferent to the spread of American political ideas in a great and highly civilized country like France.”39 Others, including some Populists, socialists, and widely read authors such as Mark Twain and Theodore Dreiser, were not as certain about those ideas.","['thirty-five-year', 'the 1840s', '1870']",ideology try change 1865–1900 era bind end karl marx ’s das kapital charles darwin ’s descent man writing jame freud intellectual ferment unsurpassed thirty year period manifest destiny remain ring cry proclaim journal age steel regard export trade 1840s young america expansionist demand take mexico president ulyss s. grant doubt stun french official 1870 congratulate establish republic add “ indifferent spread political idea great highly civilized country like france.”39 include populist socialist widely read author mark twain theodore dreiser certain idea,81,"[1840, 1870]",1855,2,1875,1900
402,"One set of ideas, however, engaged many Americans. Social Darwinism was the loose application of Charles Darwin’s theories to the socioeconomic world. Herbert Spencer helped popularize this deviant Darwinism in his British homeland. From the 1880s to World War I, frequent travel by the American social and intellectual elite, and intermarriage between U.S. and British families, created networks for the transmission of ideas such as Spencer’s. Social Darwinism and its belief in evolutionary social-economic progress took hold in the United States far more than elsewhere. After all, Americans were becoming more successful economically than those who lived elsewhere on the globe, and to have this success explained by such terms as “survival of the fittest” seemed to provide evidence of the blessings of nature and the goodness of inevitability.",['the 1880s'],set idea engage american social darwinism loose application charles darwin ’s theory socioeconomic world herbert spencer help popularize deviant darwinism british homeland 1880s world war frequent travel social intellectual elite intermarriage u.s british family create network transmission idea spencer ’s social darwinism belief evolutionary social economic progress take hold united state far american successful economically live globe success explain term “ survival fit ” provide evidence blessing nature goodness inevitability,70,[1880],1880,1,1900,1900
403,"Carnegie was among the many who found social Darwinism highly congenial. It reinforced his belief in progress and reaffirmed that his capitalist order was a natural improvement over the past. It also neatly protected property by urging a reliance on evolution rather than revolution. In an influential paper, “The Significance of the Frontier in American History,” given at the Chicago World’s Fair amid the 1893 economic disasters, Frederick Jackson Turner of the University of Wisconsin explained four hundred years of American success by arguing that “in this progress from savage conditions [on the frontier] lie topics for the evolutionist.” The best-known American popularizer of Darwin and Spencer was John Fiske, a first-rate lecturer who traveled across the country preaching the third-rate history that he had written. In such essays as “Manifest Destiny” (1885), Fiske directly linked U.S. commercial success overseas to the spread of American ideology and thus the triumph of peace, especially in Europe: “The victory of the industrial over the military type of civilization will at last become complete.” Evolutionary progress, which to Fiske was much the same thing as U.S. economic supremacy, required such a victory.40","['1893', 'four hundred years', '1885']",carnegie find social darwinism highly congenial reinforce belief progress reaffirm capitalist order natural improvement past neatly protect property urge reliance evolution revolution influential paper “ significance frontier history ” give chicago world ’s fair amid 1893 economic disaster frederick jackson turner university wisconsin explain year success argue “ progress savage condition frontier lie topic evolutionist ” best know popularizer darwin spencer john fiske rate lecturer travel country preach rate history write essay “ manifest destiny 1885 fiske directly link u.s commercial success overseas spread ideology triumph peace especially europe “ victory industrial military type civilization complete ” evolutionary progress fiske thing u.s economic supremacy require victory.40,106,"[1893, 1885]",1889,2,1900,1900

Historian Matthew Frye Jacobson summarized the situation: “In the period between the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 (in which the United States announced its power on the international scene) and World War I (in which it demonstrated that power), the dynamics of industrialization rapidly accelerated the rate at which Americans were coming into contact with the foreign peoples both inside and outside U.S. borders.” Jacobson emphasized that “American political culture in these years was characterized by a paradoxical combination of supreme confidence in U.S. superiority and righteousness, with an anxiety driven by fierce parochialism.”44 Not for the last time in American history, the lethal combination of economic power and “fierce parochialism” triggered an explosion of expansion and disorder – even revolution.","['1876', 'these years']",understand future require understand grow power economy agricultural industrial expansionism – disorder – cause historian matthew frye jacobson summarize situation “ period centennial exposition philadelphia 1876 united state announce power international scene world war demonstrate power dynamic industrialization rapidly accelerate rate american come contact foreign people inside outside u.s border ” jacobson emphasize “ political culture year characterize paradoxical combination supreme confidence u.s superiority righteousness anxiety drive fierce parochialism.”44 time history lethal combination economic power “ fierce parochialism ” trigger explosion expansion disorder – revolution,85,[1876],1876,1,1900,1900
405,"The American population is a mosaic, a people whose makeup can resemble much of the world with which it deals in foreign policy. Between the Civil War and World War I the mosaic became so pronounced, and the number of immigrants so enormous, that a historic turn was reached in the 1880s when, for the first time in the nation’s life, legislation excluded certain immigrants (in this case, Chinese). The exclusionary act was shaped by the economic downturn, but also by a deep-seated racism that, while it excluded some Asians, led to the lynching of numbers of Asians and African Americans in the 1880s and 1890s. It also melded with chaotic and tragic economic conditions in the West to produce a series of wars waged by the U.S. army against Indians. With the ending of those wars, force had succeeded in consolidating non-Indian control of the continent.1 Only militant laborers and angry farmers remained to pose a domestic threat to order after 1890. This consolidation of the continent, training of military forces, contradictory feelings about immigrants, and, above all, racism not only characterized these late nineteenth-century decades but also were central in shaping U.S. foreign policy then and in the new century.","['the 1880s', 'the 1880s and 1890s', '1890', 'these late nineteenth-century decades', 'the new century']",population mosaic people makeup resemble world deal foreign policy civil war world war mosaic pronounced number immigrant enormous historic turn reach 1880s time nation ’s life legislation exclude certain immigrant case chinese exclusionary act shape economic downturn deep seat racism exclude asian lead lynching number asian african american 1880 1890s meld chaotic tragic economic condition west produce series war wag u.s army indian ending war force succeed consolidate non indian control continent.1 militant laborer angry farmer remain pose domestic threat order 1890 consolidation continent training military force contradictory feeling immigrant racism characterize late nineteenth century decade central shape u.s foreign policy new century,103,"[1880, 1890]",1885,2,1900,1900

Canadians (particularly in 1880–3) and Chinese (in the years 1873–82) also entered in large numbers. European immigrants were a major reason the United States had the world’s leading economy by 1913: The total work force in industry and agriculture shot up from 14.7 million in 1870 to 38.3 million in 1913. The road was not one-way. Between 1898 and 1914, about 1 million Americans left the Plains states for wheat-growing western Canada to escape the collapse in the United States of both agricultural prices and radical agrarian political movements in which many of the emigrants believed. Such emigration formed part of an enormous movement of people out of economically depressed areas of the Western world. In the 1880s alone, 5 million Europeans went to the United States, 900,000 to Canada, and 500,000 to Brazil.

Between 1880 and 1914 more than three million Russian citizens came to the United States. Most, especially Jews and Roman Catholics, belonged to ethnic and religious minorities. One such minority was the Mennonites, superb farmers who left the Ukraine, after turning it into the breadbasket of Russia, because the tsar insisted in 1871 that they join the military. Nearly twenty thousand of this pacifist sect settled in the American Great Plains, sowed seeds they had brought with them from the old country, and so began the winter wheat crop that made the region, especially Kansas, prosperous.5","['1881', 'Between 1880 and 1914', '1871', 'winter']",“ slavs ” flood tsar ’s empire united state especially alexander ii ’s reform end assassination 1881 terrible backlash include pogrom begin sweep russia 1880 1914 million russian citizen come united state especially jews roman catholic belong ethnic religious minority minority mennonite superb farmer leave ukraine turn breadbasket russia tsar insist 1871 join military nearly thousand pacifist sect settle great plain sow seed bring old country begin winter wheat crop region especially kansas prosperous.5,74,"[1881, 1871]",1876,2,1900,1900

More than one-quarter of the population had now been born in foreign nations, and increasingly those nations were not Great Britain or Scotland. The American Protective Association was organized to advance the argument that it was time, if not past time, for immigration restriction, because racially Americans could no longer be improved upon. There was also growing concern that the newcomers could be less easily absorbed than the old mainline Protestant emigrants, and that they held communal beliefs suspiciously resembling those of the growing European socialist movements. As the American Federation of Labor was formed in the mid-1880s, it included many immigrants, but it and other unions were concluding logically that if many more like them swarmed into the labor market in ever larger numbers, higher wages and better conditions would not result.","['the late 1880s', 'the mid-1880s']",late 1880s few american see bright migration quarter population bear foreign nation increasingly nation great britain scotland protective association organize advance argument time past time immigration restriction racially american longer improve grow concern newcomer easily absorb old mainline protestant emigrant hold communal belief suspiciously resemble grow european socialist movement federation labor form mid-1880 include immigrant union conclude logically like swarm labor market large number high wage good condition result,69,"[1880, 1880]",1880,2,1900,1900

To the contrary, ardent expansionists believed a more homogeneous, Protestant, and Anglo-Saxon America could best fulfill its global Manifest Destiny. Josiah Strong’s Our Country (1885), combined nativist beliefs with overseas economic and cultural expansionism to become a best seller and a reference point for later Americans. James G. Blaine, the leading Republican of the 1880s and an ardent expansionist, especially in the realm of international trade, worked vigorously against allowing in any more “cheap labor,” especially from Asia, even as he planned to achieve U.S. economic domination of the entire hemisphere through a Pan-American movement.

414,"The Statue of Liberty’s dedication preceded the most violent peacetime decade in American history to that point. The violence was especially generated by racism and centered on African Americans, who were fully segregated, with the Supreme Court’s agreement, by 1896. Segregation, however, did not save thousands who were lynched during this era. In the 1890s, white Americans lynched an average of one African American every two and a half days. The 162 lynchings of 1892 marked the historic high. (Sixty-two whites were also lynched by mobs.) Some eight million blacks were systematically excluded from voting and holding office; George White’s (R.-N.C.) departure in 1901 marked the last time a southern African American would sit in Congress until the arrival of Andrew Young (D.-Ga.) in 1967. The great abolitionist and journalist Frederick Douglass had been honored by four Republican presidents for his work among his fellow blacks, but as minister to Haiti in 1891 he was fired by President Benjamin Harrison for not showing sufficient enthusiasm for U.S. imperialistic ventures in the black Caribbean nation.

415,"It had not begun this way in the 1860s, when Radical Republicans tried to ensure the rights of African Americans, as well as Republican power, in the South. The end of Reconstruction and the return of the South’s conservative “Redeemers” to power in the late 1870s marked a turn. As economic depression, racism, and the pressures of white politics drove the section (and nation) to segregation, a social Darwinian argument reinforced the injustice. The census of 1880 seemed to show that Southern blacks were increasing in number more rapidly than whites. If, as the social Darwinians argued, high birthrates were the key to deciding which races were to survive, whites were in trouble. They began to demand more segregation and, most notably, shipping blacks to overseas colonies – a solution to the race problem seriously advanced by earlier Americans from James Madison through Abraham Lincoln. Because these colonialists usually eyed Central America and West Africa, the effects on foreign relations could have been profound. In 1890 and 1900, however, the censuses concluded the numbers of blacks were decreasing, not increasing, proportionally to whites. Walter F. Wilcox, who directed the 1900 census, drew the conclusions: African Americans were to follow the fate of Indians, because the effects of “disease, vice, and profound discouragement” on these “lower people” condemned them to have ever smaller numbers in the United States.10 This view, resting racial superiority on social Darwinian categories and doubtful statistics, also influenced U.S. foreign policy, not least in Hawaii, the Philippines, and the Caribbean.","['the 1860s', 'the late 1870s', '1880', '–', '1890', '1900', '1900']",begin way 1860s radical republican try ensure right african american republican power south end reconstruction return south ’s conservative “ redeemer ” power late 1870 mark turn economic depression racism pressure white politic drive section nation segregation social darwinian argument reinforce injustice census 1880 southern black increase number rapidly white social darwinian argue high birthrate key decide race survive white trouble begin demand segregation notably ship black overseas colony – solution race problem seriously advance early american james madison abraham lincoln colonialist usually eyed central america west africa effect foreign relation profound 1890 1900 census conclude number black decrease increase proportionally white walter f. wilcox direct 1900 census draw conclusion african american follow fate indians effect “ disease vice profound discouragement “ low people ” condemn small number united states.10 view rest racial superiority social darwinian category doubtful statistic influence u.s foreign policy hawaii philippine caribbean,146,"[1860, 1870, 1880, 1890, 1900, 1900]",1883,6,1900,1900
416,"After eleven Italian immigrants were lynched in New Orleans in 1891 and the Italian government bitterly protested, legislation was introduced in Congress outlawing lynching – of aliens. Except for some Northern Republicans, few others were as concerned about African Americans. Racial problems were not limited to the South or, of course, to lynchings. Even as lynchings decreased to around eighty in 1905, race riots occurred in New York as well as North Carolina; Springfield, Illinois (Lincoln’s home); and Atlanta (the seat of the so-called New South). Against this background, an idea of “the white man’s burden” shaping U.S. foreign policy took on a particular connotation of white paternalism, which, if rejected, or unsuccessful, led easily to the use of force. Theodore Roosevelt, for example, believed at times that he was a benevolent imperialist. Just as he liked the accommodationist racial programs at home of Booker T. Washington and Edgar Gardner Murphy, Roosevelt liked to think that, given time and guidance, the Caribbean and Filipino peoples (at least those he saw as the better middle-class, urban residents) could also begin to rise through the stages to civilization.

Some 63,000 Chinese were in the United States, with 50,000 concentrated in California, even before the 1868 treaty allowed unrestricted numbers of Chinese laborers to enter the country. Episodes of beatings, even of Chinese being stoned to death by whites in California, were already known. As tens of thousands more entered to work, especially on railroads, the depression struck and railroad building slowed. When violence and anti-Chinese feelings grew, the Grant administration did little, but in 1879 Congress moved to reduce Chinese immigration. President Rutherford B. Hayes vetoed the bill because it was inconsistent with the 1868 treaty. An 1880 Sino-American treaty allowed the reduction, but not the prohibition, of the immigration.

Voices from the South’s cotton mill areas opposed both the 1882 act and the 1892 extension. As Senator John T. Morgan (D.-Ala.) declared in 1892, it would be “a very unwise step to put China into an attitude where she would break up commercial relations with us.” He and the millowners, however, were henceforth going to have to trust to diplomacy and force, not commonly agreed upon interests, to keep Chinese markets open. Mark Twain’s large audiences learned that he not only condemned the treatment of African Americans (his wife said Twain might get along better if he would “consider everybody colored till he is proved white”) but also defended Chinese rights in California. Twain was increasingly isolated and embittered in the 1890s as the United States rolled on toward becoming one of the great world powers by subjugating nonwhite peoples. Twain had brought in the post-1882 era with his bittersweet classic, Huckleberry Finn, in which Huck finds freedom, and escapes the clutches of civilization, when he decides to “light out for the territory ahead of the rest.” By the end of the 1880s, after the slaughter of Chinese in Wyoming and labor protesters and Chicago police in the 1886 Haymarket Riot, Twain published A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court. The Yankee inventor, whom Twain privately said was a fool even if a genius with technology, discovers there is no more open “territory” and ends up using his skill with machinery to kill twenty-five thousand people. The Second Industrial Revolution, Twain seemed to be saying, only had limited means for restoring order amid the chaos and opposition it had created.14","['1882', '1892', '1892', 'the 1890s', 'the end of the 1880s']",american protest historic reversal immigration policy support military force voice south ’s cotton mill area oppose 1882 act 1892 extension senator john t. morgan d .- ala declare 1892 “ unwise step china attitude break commercial relation millowner henceforth go trust diplomacy force commonly agree interest chinese market open mark twain ’s large audience learn condemn treatment african american wife say twain good “ consider everybody color till prove white ” defend chinese right california twain increasingly isolated embittered 1890s united state roll great world power subjugate nonwhite people twain bring post-1882 era bittersweet classic huckleberry finn huck find freedom escape clutch civilization decide “ light territory ahead rest ” end 1880 slaughter chinese wyoming labor protester chicago police 1886 haymarket riot twain publish connecticut yankee king arthur ’s court yankee inventor twain privately say fool genius technology discover open “ territory ” end skill machinery kill thousand people second industrial revolution twain say limit mean restore order amid chaos opposition created.14,162,"[1882, 1892, 1892, 1890, 1880]",1887,5,1900,1900

423,"Historian Patricia Nelson Limerick has argued that the word “frontier,” in this context, is an “Anglo-centered concept.” Such “Turnerian history” led to “flattening and distorting the complexity” of the American West and pushed “minority people … to the edge of significance.” It can be further argued that to study this West in the post-1865 years without tying it to post-1890s foreign policy – and vice versa – is also flattening and distorting the era. The relationships are many. Constitutionally, for example, early U.S. treaties defined the Indian tribes as nations, but by 1835 these people were considered “subject” to Washington’s “dominion and control,” and in 1871 the Supreme Court took the final step by declaring that Congress could override the old treaties by passing new laws. In the decade after the 1898 war, the Court, in the Insular Cases, similarly gave Congress virtually a blank check to pass laws governing the new colonial possessions. As Protestant missionaries intended to “civilize” the Indians by converting them from native religions to Christianity, so missionaries intended to “civilize” native Hawaiians or even Filipinos (many of whom were Roman Catholic). And as officials discovered that with the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 they could force the Indians to switch from communal ownership to individual ownership and thus enable whites to buy thousands of acres of land from puzzled or bankrupt Indians, so U.S. land policies in Hawaii, the Philippines, and the Caribbean gave white Americans and their political allies both land and leverage. This post–Civil War generation understood the power created by redistributing, or not redistributing, property. For example, while breaking up Indian lands for the benefit of white settlers, U.S. officials destroyed the hope of freedmen and yeoman farmers in the South to be more self-sufficient by not redistributing plantation lands. Americans’ acute sensitivity to the enormous power inherent in land redistribution, whether in the South, the Philippines, Cuba, or Central America in the late twentieth century, is a story needing to be told.16","['the post-1865 years', '–', '–', '1835', '1871', 'the decade', '1898', '1887', '–', 'the late twentieth century']",historian patricia nelson limerick argue word “ frontier ” context “ anglo center concept ” “ turnerian history ” lead “ flattening distort complexity ” west push “ minority people … edge significance ” argue study west post-1865 year tie post-1890 foreign policy – vice versa – flatten distort era relationship constitutionally example early u.s treaty define indian tribe nation 1835 people consider “ subject ” washington ’s “ dominion control ” 1871 supreme court take final step declare congress override old treaty pass new law decade 1898 war court insular case similarly give congress virtually blank check pass law govern new colonial possession protestant missionary intend “ civilize ” indians convert native religion christianity missionary intend “ civilize ” native hawaiian filipinos roman catholic official discover dawes severalty act 1887 force indians switch communal ownership individual ownership enable white buy thousand acre land puzzled bankrupt indian u.s land policy hawaii philippine caribbean give white american political ally land leverage post – civil war generation understand power create redistribute redistribute property example break indian land benefit white settler u.s official destroy hope freedman yeoman farmer south self sufficient redistribute plantation land americans’ acute sensitivity enormous power inherent land redistribution south philippine cuba central america late twentieth century story need told.16,210,"[1865, 1835, 1871, 1898, 1887]",1871,5,1875,1900

425,"The one stunning detour in this path to continental empire occurred during the nation’s centennial celebration. General George Armstrong Custer’s Seventh Cavalry of 260 men had been stationed in the upper Plains to prevent Indians from harassing the railroad builders. On June 25, 1876, Custer and his men were surrounded and exterminated at Little Bighorn in southern Montana by 2,000 Sioux and Cheyenne warriors who had better technology. The Indians used forty-one different kinds of firearms, including sixteen-shot repeating rifles. Whites, who thought the tribes had meekly accepted the orders of “civilization,” returned to an earlier view of the race. The Chicago Tribune headlined, “Horrible! The American Indian Exalts His Reputation for Satanic Ferocity.” The army killed, or forced into reservations, or – as in the case of one of Custer’s conquerors, Crazy Horse – allowed popular Wild West shows to exploit the Indians. Every significant war during the era was caused by Indians rebelling against being forced into controlled reservations.","['’s centennial', 'June 25, 1876', '–', 'the era']","stunning detour path continental empire occur nation ’s centennial celebration general george armstrong custer ’s seventh cavalry 260 man station upper plain prevent indian harass railroad builder june 25 1876 custer man surround exterminate little bighorn southern montana 2,000 sioux cheyenne warrior good technology indians different kind firearm include sixteen shot repeat rifle white think tribe meekly accept order “ civilization ” return early view race chicago tribune headline “ horrible indian exalt reputation satanic ferocity ” army kill force reservation – case custer ’s conqueror crazy horse – allow popular wild west show exploit indians significant war era cause indian rebel force control reservation",105,[1876],1876,1,1900,1900

Then came the Dawes Act and, in 1889, the opening of 3 million acres of their land in the present state of Oklahoma. By 1900, the Indians controlled only 78 million acres. The last major killing had occurred ten years before when President Benjamin Harrison broke the nation’s treaties and opened Sioux territory in South Dakota to settlement. The tribes, devastated by illness and starvation, had turned to mystical religions, including a “Ghost Dance” that promised freedom from white rule. In January 1890, U.S. army units surrounded the Wounded Knee settlement, and when guns were accidentally fired, the troops poured shot into the encampment. One hundred forty-six men, women, and children of the Sioux were killed.18","['1886', 'The next year', '1889', '1900', 'ten years', 'January 1890']",1886 apache leader geronimo compel surrender year indians hold 187 million acre land come dawes act 1889 opening 3 million acre land present state oklahoma 1900 indians control 78 million acre major killing occur year president benjamin harrison break nation ’s treaty open sioux territory south dakota settlement tribe devastate illness starvation turn mystical religion include “ ghost dance ” promise freedom white rule january 1890 u.s army unit surround wound knee settlement gun accidentally fire troop pour shoot encampment man woman child sioux killed.18,85,"[1886, 1889, 1900, 1890]",1891,4,1900,1900

Its most famous historian, Frederick Jackson Turner, wrote that the “stronghold of these demands” to extend “American influence to outlying islands and adjoining countries” was “west of the Alleghenies.” Especially strong support for the 1898 war came from the western regions of Populist radicalism and free-silver demands, where, historians have suggested, the rebellion that shaped these movements was transferred with little difficulty to opposing Spanish colonialism in Cuba and the Philippines. The link between that political discontent in a closed West and the demand for overseas expansion had actually been made as early as 1881, when diplomatic troubleshooter and trade expert John Kasson wrote publicly, “We are utilizing the whole of our continental territory.

The man who puts the soil to use must of right dispossess the man who does not, or the world will come to a standstill.” Elihu Root, perhaps the nation’s leading corporate lawyer and later Roosevelt’s secretary of state, justified in 1902 why Americans had a right to rule people in the Caribbean and the Pacific. The Declaration of Independence, Root argued, was for a “highly civilized, self-governing people,” not the barbarians and semicivilized. “Without the consent of hundreds of thousands of Indians whom our fathers found in possession of this land,” Root continued, “we have assumed and exercised sovereignty over them.” The same principle applied to “the ignorant and credulous Filipinos.”22",['1902'],better exemplify link west post-1890 expansionism theodore roosevelt know multivolume history winning west 1889–96 explain land manifest destiny anticipate argument justify overseas conquest “ indians real title soil … great continent keep game preserve squalid savage … man put soil use right dispossess man world come standstill ” elihu root nation ’s lead corporate lawyer later roosevelt ’s secretary state justify 1902 american right rule people caribbean pacific declaration independence root argue “ highly civilized self govern people ” barbarian semiciviliz “ consent hundred thousand indians father find possession land ” root continue “ assume exercise sovereignty ” principle apply “ ignorant credulous filipinos.”22,104,[1902],1902,1,1925,1950

The era ended with the United States exclusively owning and fortifying the canal, militarily and economically dominating the Caribbean through a network of bases, occupying Nicaragua with U.S. marines, and verging on an invasion of Mexico.

The British had not only recognized the Confederacy’s belligerency status but also allowed their shipyards to build vessels (notably the Alabama) for the South that extensively damaged Union shipping. By 1869, when President Ulysses S. Grant and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish began shaping foreign policy, the Alabama claims threatened a new crisis in Anglo-American relations. Grant deeply mistrusted the British, especially given his green memories of their siding with the South. He flatly declared that if a U.S. general could not conquer Canada in thirty days, he deserved a dishonorable discharge. Fish had a less visceral response than did the president, but his pre–Civil War Whig colleagues (Seward and John Quincy Adams) had also been his foreign policy mentors, and all agreed that the United States could look forward to a happy future as such states as Canada, Cuba, Mexico, and perhaps others voluntarily came into the Union – like “ripe apples” falling into a lap, as Adams memorably phrased it. Powerful Republican senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, however, took a hatchet to the tree when he proposed in 1869–70 that the British recompense the United States for their Civil War mistakes by handing over Canada immediately.1","['1869', 'thirty days', '–']",washington london relation reach crisis proportion civil war british recognize confederacy ’s belligerency status allow shipyard build vessel notably alabama south extensively damage union shipping 1869 president ulyss s. grant secretary state hamilton fish begin shape foreign policy alabama claim threaten new crisis anglo relation grant deeply mistrust british especially give green memory siding south flatly declare u.s general conquer canada thirty day deserve dishonorable discharge fish visceral response president pre – civil war whig colleague seward john quincy adams foreign policy mentor agree united state look forward happy future state canada cuba mexico voluntarily come union – like “ ripe apple ” fall lap adam memorably phrase powerful republican senator charles sumner massachusetts take hatchet tree propose 1869–70 british recompense united state civil war mistake hand canada immediately.1,129,[1869],1869,1,1875,1900
436,"In his classic autobiography, The Education of Henry Adams, the author recalled in 1907 that this demand of Sumner’s “opened the gravest doubts of Sumner’s sanity.” Such had not been Adams’s actual response nearly forty years earlier. In a widely noted essay of 1870, Adams disagreed only over tactics. Because Great Britain’s interests lay in Asia, he wrote, and because “her American possessions are a source of weakness,” Adams concluded that conciliation, not confrontation, would most quickly tie Canada to the United States. His article exemplified an upswing in expansionist sentiment during 1869–70. Southerners urged action in Cuba and Santo Domingo, as did many in the North. Radical Republicans besides Sumner led the successful repeal of the 1854 reciprocity trade treaty with Canada on the theory that with their trade jeopardized, Canadians would seek annexation. The chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Nathaniel Banks (R.-Mass.), thought, as usual, in large terms. He introduced a joint resolution declaring that an independent Canada was an “implied infraction” of the Monroe Doctrine. Such anti-British feelings were helped along by the raids of the U.S.-based Irish Fenian Brotherhood into Canada between 1866 and 1870. Both President Johnson and President Grant tried to stop them by enforcing U.S. neutrality laws, and thus the wonderful opportunity opened to politicians to defend the Fenians, court the Irish vote, and woo the many others who disliked the British.2","['1907', 'nearly forty years earlier', '1870', '1869–70', 'between 1866 and 1870']",classic autobiography education henry adams author recall 1907 demand sumner ’s “ open grave doubt sumner ’s sanity ” adams ’s actual response nearly year earlier widely note essay 1870 adam disagree tactic great britain ’s interest lie asia write “ possession source weakness ” adam conclude conciliation confrontation quickly tie canada united state article exemplify upswing expansionist sentiment 1869–70 southerner urge action cuba santo domingo north radical republican sumner lead successful repeal 1854 reciprocity trade treaty canada theory trade jeopardize canadian seek annexation chair house foreign affair committee nathaniel bank r .- mass think usual large term introduce joint resolution declare independent canada “ imply infraction ” monroe doctrine anti british feeling help raid u.s .- base irish fenian brotherhood canada 1866 1870 president johnson president grant try stop enforce u.s neutrality law wonderful opportunity open politician defend fenian court irish vote woo dislike british.2,146,"[1907, 1870, 1869]",1882,3,1900,1900

The so-called rebellion, led by Louis Riel, received warm encouragement from U.S. senators in Minnesota and Michigan, as well as from Grant and Fish. Banker, speculator, and railroad magnate Jay Cooke invested in the rebellion in the hope that annexation of the region to the United States would remove the possibility of a Canadian transcontinental rail system that would compete with his Northern Pacific Railroad in the United States. As usual, that catalyst of the West, the land speculator, encouraged the rebellion. The annexation drive failed, however, as the many Roman Catholics in the Red River country disliked the idea of joining the Protestants to the south, and Fish rejected proposals that he slip large bribes to rebel leaders to help overcome such religious feelings. Canadian officials dispatched troops and then patiently offered more local autonomy and the promise of railroads. In late 1870 Grant instructed Fish to forget about using the talks with the British to annex Canada. That decision marked a crucial turn, and, with that problem removed, the Alabama claims were settled.3","['1869–70', 'late 1870']",fresh opportunity expansion northward suddenly appear 1869–70 red river area present manitoba move rebellion canada try rule call rebellion lead louis riel receive warm encouragement u.s senator minnesota michigan grant fish banker speculator railroad magnate jay cooke invest rebellion hope annexation region united state remove possibility canadian transcontinental rail system compete northern pacific railroad united state usual catalyst west land speculator encourage rebellion annexation drive fail roman catholic red river country dislike idea join protestant south fish reject proposal slip large bribe rebel leader help overcome religious feeling canadian official dispatch troop patiently offer local autonomy promise railroad late 1870 grant instruct fish forget talk british annex canada decision mark crucial turn problem remove alabama claim settled.3,117,"[1869, 1870]",1870,2,1875,1900

Arbitration procedures were also established that led to a settlement of outstanding boundary disputes (the San Juan Islands, south of Vancouver, became U.S. territory), and the United States received fishing privileges close to Canadian shores in return for $5.5 million. The vision of a U.S.-Canadian continental union never disappeared. Each nation suffered economic disasters in the 1870s and 1880s that led it to look to the other for relief. In the 1880s, 1.4 million Canadians, especially from the West, moved to the United States to find jobs. About the same number of discouraged U.S. citizens moved north during the next decade. In the late 1880s a bitter argument over Canadian and U.S. rights to kill seals in the Bering Sea led some to urge the use of force, until the British navy intervened and persuaded the United States to scale back demands.4 As late as 1911, U.S. congressional leaders reverted to the idea of a half-century earlier that a reciprocity trade treaty would inevitably pull Canada into the U.S. political as well as economic orbit. Nor did the Washington Treaty end U.S.-British confrontations (as the seal controversy and the 1895 Venezuelan boundary crisis demonstrated). Sumner, Banks, and their expansionist colleagues were nevertheless silenced. For reasons of personality and patronage, Sumner had even broken bitterly with Grant, who, in turn, worked to remove the senator as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee.

But as slavery ended in the South, the institution began to weaken in Cuba, although Spain would not finally destroy it until 1886. Cuban rebels declared war against Spain in 1868, freed slaves, and destroyed the Creoles’ sugarcane fields. Race and revolution formed a highly combustible mixture. Some Creoles moved to escape the fire by seeking U.S. annexation. A Cuban junta, with headquarters in lower Manhattan, collected more than a million dollars in 1868–9 to push annexation forward. If there was to be a revolution, conservatives in both countries planned to control and benefit from it. And if Cuba was to break loose from Spain, President Grant and Secretary of War John B.

440,"Secretary of State Fish’s position was subtler. After an 1855 visit to Cuba, he concluded that the United States should keep its distance politically. The problem, in his mind, went well beyond that of slavery: “I can see no means of getting rid of a population of some 450,000 called whites but really of every shade and mixture of color, who own all the land on the island.” By 1869 Congress was urging a highly receptive Grant to recognize Cuban belligerency. Fish blocked this move by arguing that belligerency would relieve Spain of having to pay for property damages caused by the conflict and that Spain was a more acceptable ruler than the multiracial revolutionaries. At one point the secretary of state stopped Grant and his congressional allies only by threatening to resign. Fish would like to have controlled Cuba; he differed little from Seward and Adams in this regard. But he preferred helping Cuba purchase its independence, getting rid of slavery, and then using U.S. financial leverage to protect property interests, control any new government, and ensure that other, more threatening powers (such as Great Britain) would not replace the rapidly declining Spanish. Fish wanted control of, but not day-to-day responsibility for, the island. As historian William S. McFeeley has noted, “Fish did not want a portion of America governed by landowners with whom he would be uncomfortable dining, and this went not only for Cuba but for [African Americans] in Mississippi.” Fish received support from members of Congress who agreed with him about the racial problem and who also fought annexation because it would threaten U.S. beet-sugar growers. By late 1869, Grant publicly announced that he would not recognize rebel belligerency (although he might in the future) and that European colonializers such as Spain should now recognize facts and free their colonies.6","['1855', '1869', 'late 1869']","secretary state fish ’s position subtle 1855 visit cuba conclude united state distance politically problem mind go slavery “ mean get rid population 450,000 call white shade mixture color land island ” 1869 congress urge highly receptive grant recognize cuban belligerency fish block argue belligerency relieve spain have pay property damage cause conflict spain acceptable ruler multiracial revolutionary point secretary state stop grant congressional ally threaten resign fish like control cuba differ little seward adam regard prefer help cuba purchase independence get rid slavery u.s financial leverage protect property interest control new government ensure threatening power great britain replace rapidly decline spanish fish want control day day responsibility island historian william s. mcfeeley note “ fish want portion america govern landowner uncomfortable dining go cuba african american mississippi ” fish receive support member congress agree racial problem fight annexation threaten u.s beet sugar grower late 1869 grant publicly announce recognize rebel belligerency future european colonializer spain recognize fact free colonies.6",160,"[1855, 1869, 1869]",1864,3,1875,1900
441,"The revolution raged on, although in early 1873 hope rose when a republic replaced Spain’s monarchy. The hope was short-lived. Throughout the post-1868 rebellion, U.S. filibusterers, seeking thrills, glory, and opportunities, had aided the rebels with weapons and men. In November 1873, Spain captured the Virginius, a U.S. filibustering ship, and quickly executed fifty-three of the American mercenaries. Loud demands for war immediately sounded in Washington, but not from Grant and Fish. The secretary of state’s policy remained consistent. He wanted no quick annexation, he wrote Madrid, but desired Cuba’s “elevation into an independent republic of freemen.” Fish clearly thought that such an elevation would require considerable time. Most newspapers and political leaders seemed to support him. The economic panic that had suddenly struck, the hope (unrealized) that the new Spanish republic could begin liberal reforms, the shadowy mission of the Virginius, and the reluctance to go to war only to endure more racial problems – all advised abstention. At a pivotal moment, the British, who wanted no U.S. control of Cuba, helped work out a peaceful settlement. Spain apologized and paid an indemnity. The crisis passed, but not the revolution.

442,"Peace, however, was delicate. During the 1880s, and as the island’s slavery formally ended, U.S. interests in Cuba rose rapidly. Many Americans bought out plantations ruined by the war. Some Spaniards and Cubans sought the protection given by U.S. citizenship. In 1885 Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard pointedly warned an interested Germany that “the condition” of Cuba was “an especially American question.” When the U.S. Congress passed the 1890 reciprocity bill, which gave preference to Cuban sugar, the stage was set for a new attempt to break Spain’s faltering hold.8 After 1868 Washington officials cared less about order in Cuba than about holding Spain responsible for ruling the island while keeping it open to U.S. investments.

Since 1865 Santo Domingo had been unsuccessfully targeted by Seward, but New York bankers and various investors, some of them heavily involved with the corrupt dictatorship that ruled the Caribbean nation, had found highly profitable land, forests, and mines. In 1869 these Americans persuaded Grant to allow his sometime private secretary, Orville Babcock, to negotiate a treaty of annexation and another pact giving the United States a lease on the superb harbor of Samana Bay. President Buenaventura Baez happily signed to ensure Washington’s support of his rule and received $150,000, with a promise of more for his government.","['1865', '1869']","race help spur finally kill grant adventure 1865 santo domingo unsuccessfully target seward new york banker investor heavily involve corrupt dictatorship rule caribbean nation find highly profitable land forest mine 1869 american persuade grant allow private secretary orville babcock negotiate treaty annexation pact give united state lease superb harbor samana bay president buenaventura baez happily sign ensure washington ’s support rule receive 150,000 promise government",65,"[1865, 1869]",1867,2,1875,1900

Maria Child, well known for her pre–Civil War children’s books and outspoken opposition to slavery’s expansion, attacked what she termed the president’s “twin brother to our taking Texas from the poor Mexicans. This Republic will sink rapidly … to ruin, if we go on thus seizing territory of our neighbors by fraud or force.” Others also opposed Grant, but unlike Child, they feared dealing with “people of the Latin race mixed with the Indian and African blood” who had neither “institutions nor morals in common with us.” At one point during the debate, Haiti and Santo Domingo fired on each other. Without consulting Congress, Grant ordered the U.S. navy to protect Baez. A highly jealous Senate condemned the president’s order as “a usurpation” of Congress’s power to declare war. Grant retreated, thereafter deferred to the Senate’s prerogatives, and set a precedent for presidential accountability until it was undermined thirty years later by William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. The reaction against Grant’s Santo Domingo initiative even helped split his party and led to a Liberal Republican opposition ticket headed by Horace Greeley in the 1872 election.","['–', 'thirty years later', '1872']",reverberation grant ’s defeat maria child known pre – civil war child ’s book outspoken opposition slavery ’s expansion attack term president ’s “ twin brother take texas poor mexican republic sink rapidly … ruin seize territory neighbor fraud force ” oppose grant unlike child fear deal “ people latin race mix indian african blood ” “ institution moral common ” point debate haiti santo domingo fire consult congress grant order u.s navy protect baez highly jealous senate condemn president ’s order “ usurpation ” congress ’s power declare war grant retreat defer senate ’s prerogative set precedent presidential accountability undermine thirty year later william mckinley theodore roosevelt reaction grant ’s santo domingo initiative help split party lead liberal republican opposition ticket head horace greeley 1872 election,127,[1872],1872,1,1875,1900

Reiterating the Monroe Doctrine, Grant, in words written by Fish, added that it was an “equally important principle that hereafter no territory on this continent shall be regarded as subject of transfer to a European power.” He had integrated an unqualified no-transfer principle for the first time into the sacred principles of Monroe.10 It was a warning especially to the European imperialists who hovered over the slowly dying Spanish empire.",['May 1870'],grant fish produce historic achievement united state santo domingo president announce 1870 reiterate monroe doctrine grant word write fish add “ equally important principle territory continent shall regard subject transfer european power ” integrate unqualified transfer principle time sacred principle monroe.10 warning especially european imperialist hover slowly die spanish empire,50,[1870],1870,1,1875,1900

Such results had been accomplished without benefit of a reciprocity treaty negotiated in 1883 by none other than the recently retired president, Ulysses S. Grant. In Congress the treaty had gone down before a coalition of Republican protectionists and Democratic low-tariff advocates, although they seemed careful to administer the final blow only in 1887 after Grant had died. The treaty’s defeat obviously did not weaken the thread of trade that was interweaving the two economies.11","['1860', '1890', '1900', '1883', '1887']",1860 u.s trade mexico amount 7 million 1890 quadruple 1900 reach 64 million result accomplish benefit reciprocity treaty negotiate 1883 recently retire president ulyss s. grant congress treaty go coalition republican protectionist democratic low tariff advocate careful administer final blow 1887 grant die treaty ’s defeat obviously weaken thread trade interweave economies.11,52,"[1860, 1890, 1900, 1883, 1887]",1884,5,1900,1900

By 1910, as the Mexican Revolution was about to erupt, U.S. citizens owned 43 percent of the country’s property, or more than did Mexicans.

448,"As the French exited in 1866, Seward predicted an onslaught of U.S. capital and population into Mexico. The problems were Mexican political instability and fear of U.S. influences. In 1876, stability arrived when Porfirio Díaz seized power in a coup d’état and began a thirty-five-year rule. Fish and his successor, William M. Evarts, secretary of state under Rutherford B. Hayes (1877–81), refused at first to recognize Díaz because he seemed to be unable to pay Mexico’s financial obligations or stop bandit raids across the U.S. border. Evarts finally granted recognition in 1878, and in 1880 Díaz destroyed his opposition. Evarts was well prepared to realize Seward’s prophecy. A graduate of elite schools and possessor of a powerful political and legal mind, Evarts had helped lead the effort to make Seward president in 1860 and remained close to his fellow New Yorker as Andrew Johnson’s attorney general. Believing that “the vast resources of our country need an outlet,” Evarts stressed that “it is for us to enter into the harvest-field and reap it.” During posh dinners at New York Delmonico’s and elsewhere, he stressed that an improved U.S. consular service was necessary to point investors and traders toward those harvest fields. He understood, he declared, that “the leading commercial communities of the United States” wanted, among other help, consuls who regularly reported on foreign labor conditions, wages, and business customs. In 1878, Evarts instructed the consuls to issue such regular reports.12","['1866', '1876', 'five-year', '1878', '1880', '1860', '1878']",french exit 1866 seward predict onslaught u.s capital population mexico problem mexican political instability fear u.s influence 1876 stability arrive porfirio díaz seize power coup d’état begin thirty year rule fish successor william m. evart secretary state rutherford b. haye 1877–81 refuse recognize díaz unable pay mexico ’s financial obligation stop bandit raid u.s border evart finally grant recognition 1878 1880 díaz destroy opposition evart prepared realize seward ’s prophecy graduate elite school possessor powerful political legal mind evart help lead effort seward president 1860 remain close fellow new yorker andrew johnson ’s attorney general believe vast resource country need outlet ” evart stress “ enter harvest field reap ” posh dinner new york delmonico ’s stress improve u.s consular service necessary point investor trader harvest field understand declare “ lead commercial community united state ” want help consul regularly report foreign labor condition wage business custom 1878 evart instruct consul issue regular reports.12,154,"[1866, 1876, 1878, 1880, 1860, 1878]",1873,6,1875,1900
449,"Díaz meanwhile had dispatched his own agents to drum up investors’ interest. They were highly successful. Evarts’s State Department successor, James G. Blaine (1881), pushed cooperation along by taking another leaf from Seward’s book and assuring Mexico that the United States no longer wanted land, only full and unfettered access so that North Americans, with their “large accumulation of capital, for which their own vast resources fail to give full scope for the untiring energy of its citizens,” could develop Mexico’s “scarcely developed resources.” Mexico, Blaine stressed, could then “still further develop into a well ordered and prosperous state.” Peace and stability for investors and traders meant peace and stability for Mexico.

450,"Railroad builders in the United States were among the pioneers. They had tried to lay track in the 1860s to link up with their own transcontinental system, but the plan fell to Mexico’s anti-Americanism. Between 1880 and 1883, however, U.S. investors, including Grant and Jay Gould, received concessions for 2,500 miles of track over five railway systems. Grant’s and Gould’s projects were destroyed by the former president’s bankruptcy in 1884 and Gould’s disinterest, but such leading builders as the heads of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Sante Fe Railroad did begin to construct a transportation system in Mexico. They were soon followed by an American invasion, as Europeans a generation later called the sudden appearance of many U.S. businesses: agricultural implements, weapons, sewing machines, life insurance, furniture, even two North American newspapers. Of special importance, investments in Mexico’s rich mineral wealth soared. In the late 1880s the first small oil companies appeared. By 1888, $30 million was invested in mining (including investments by a group led by Senator Henry Teller [R.-Col.]). Two years later Solomon Guggenheim began his highly profitable silver-lead smelting operation.14","['the 1860s', 'Between 1880 and 1883', '1884', 'the late 1880s', '1888', 'Two years later']","railroad builder united state pioneer try lay track 1860s link transcontinental system plan fall mexico ’s anti americanism 1880 1883 u.s investor include grant jay gould receive concession 2,500 mile track railway system grant ’s gould ’s project destroy president ’s bankruptcy 1884 gould ’s disinterest lead builder head pennsylvania railroad sante fe railroad begin construct transportation system mexico soon follow invasion europeans generation later call sudden appearance u.s business agricultural implement weapon sewing machine life insurance furniture north newspaper special importance investment mexico ’s rich mineral wealth soar late 1880 small oil company appear 1888 30 million invest mining include investment group lead senator henry teller r .- col year later solomon guggenheim begin highly profitable silver lead smelting operation.14",121,"[1860, 1884, 1880, 1888]",1878,4,1900,1900
451," As early as 1885, George B. McCIellan, the old Civil War general, declared that these multiplying investments in Mexico required that the U.S. army be rebuilt to protect them. In 1888, Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard (1885–9) wrote, “The overflow of our population and capital into … Mexico, must… saturate those regions with Americanism, and control their political action,” but “we do not want them” until “they are fit.” In 1895, Americans in Mexico City were so pleased with Díaz that they petitioned him to continue his dictatorial rule for another presidential term. The U.S. chargé was about to sign the petition until Alvey A. Adee, the all-wise and all-watchful second assistant secretary of state, told the chargé such involvement in the politics of other nations was forbidden. That same year, amid the depths of economic depression, Bradstreet’s reported that “there are fully three times as many Americans in Mexico this winter looking up lands as were there last winter.” Historian David Pletcher has linked this early U.S. diplomatic initiative with the investment flood by examining the career of Warner Perrin Sutton, the U.S. consul at Matamoros, near the Rio Grande’s mouth, who obeyed Evarts’s instructions by flooding Washington and the business community with helpful reports and shepherding investors around Mexico:","['1885', '1888', '1885–9', '1895', 'That same year', 'this winter', 'last winter']",early 1885 george b. mcciellan old civil war general declare multiply investment mexico require u.s army rebuild protect 1888 secretary state thomas f. bayard 1885–9 write “ overflow population capital … mexico … saturate region americanism control political action ” “ want “ fit ” 1895 american mexico city pleased díaz petition continue dictatorial rule presidential term u.s chargé sign petition alvey a. adee wise watchful second assistant secretary state tell chargé involvement politic nation forbid year amid depth economic depression bradstreet ’s report “ fully time american mexico winter look land winter ” historian david pletcher link early u.s diplomatic initiative investment flood examine career warner perrin sutton u.s consul matamoros near rio grande ’s mouth obey evart ’s instruction flood washington business community helpful report shepherd investor mexico,130,"[1885, 1888, 1885, 1895]",1888,4,1900,1900

The company became as powerful, if not more so, than any Central American government. United Fruit and its subsidiaries soon owned mines, ranches, banana plantations, railways, ports, and – at critical moments – governments, especially in Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala. Resembling Mexico, Central America was also entering into a turbulent era of war, if not yet revolution. Already in the 1880s, secretaries of state Blaine and Bayard used direct threats, and in Bayard’s case the dispatch of a warship (commanded by Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan), to protect U.S. property threatened by the wars among Central Americans and by anti-Yankee feelings in the region.16","['1883', '–', 'the 1880s']","1883 take british concession turn receive 800,000 acre 7 percent costa rican territory keith ’s holding basis united fruit company company powerful central government united fruit subsidiary soon own mine ranch banana plantation railway port – critical moment – government especially costa rica honduras guatemala resemble mexico central america enter turbulent era war revolution 1880 secretary state blaine bayard direct threat bayard ’s case dispatch warship command captain alfred thayer mahan protect u.s property threaten war central american anti yankee feeling region.16",82,"[1883, 1880]",1882,2,1900,1900

By the 1880s Germans were second to the British in Costa Rica’s coffee export industry and were becoming a dominant force in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Germany and the United States were two of the world’s fastest-growing industrial powers and so were soon competing for Latin American markets and raw materials. Germany’s interests developed so rapidly that in the 1870s Berlin sent a six-ship war fleet to Nicaragua to protect German investors and collect an indemnity. In the early 1880s, the German minister to the region assumed the political coloration of his surroundings and accused the United States of harboring imperial designs on the region.","['the 1880s', 'the 1870s', 'the early 1880s']",party europeans shape area ’s development british long force el salvador nicaragua costa rica 1880s german second british costa rica ’s coffee export industry dominant force guatemala nicaragua el salvador germany united state world ’s fastest grow industrial power soon compete latin market raw material germany ’s interest develop rapidly 1870s berlin send ship war fleet nicaragua protect german investor collect indemnity early 1880 german minister region assume political coloration surrounding accuse united state harbor imperial design region,78,"[1880, 1870, 1880]",1877,3,1900,1900

Otto von Bismarck, the “Iron Chancellor,” whose policies created modern Germany, began in the 1880s to reach for naval bases and colonies in the region. The U.S. response was so negative that Bismarck pulled back. More importantly, Bismarck had much larger issues to deal with in Europe and Asia. As he said when he left government in 1890, “I am sick and tired of colonies.” The retreat, however, proved to be tactical. In the 1890s Berlin’s economic and strategic interests grew, especially along the Atlantic coasts, where Germans built transportation networks to carry their growing exports to world markets. When Washington officials, led by Blaine, pushed for a Pan-American movement in the 1880s, they were responding to these challenges to U.S. leadership in Latin America as well as to the market and raw-material needs of their industrializing economy. In reality, the Americans vastly overestimated the German government’s ambitions in the region.

The first such systematic attempt to analyze the trade, the final set of reports stressed the advantages of European competitors and, among other conclusions, noted the need for an isthmian canal that would help loosen the hold of British trade on Latin America’s Pacific Coast.18 Seward had unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a treaty for a U.S.-controlled passageway. Over the next two decades, Washington officials, led by Evarts and Blaine, finally broke the 1850 Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, and the effort climaxed with the Hay-Pauncefote Pact of 1901, which gave the United States full control of a canal.","['1870', 'the next two decades', '1901']",1870 fish ’s request u.s consul minister latin america submit detailed report u.s trade hemisphere systematic attempt analyze trade final set report stress advantage european competitor conclusion note need isthmian canal help loosen hold british trade latin america ’s pacific coast.18 seward unsuccessfully try negotiate treaty u.s .- control passageway decade washington official lead evart blaine finally break 1850 clayton bulwer treaty effort climax hay pauncefote pact 1901 give united state control canal,73,"[1870, 1901]",1886,2,1900,1900

The quest became a crisis, however, in 1879, when Ferdinand de Lesseps, who had built the Suez Canal, announced that his French firm would construct a Panamanian route. Evarts and Hayes warned, in the president’s words, that “the United States should control this great highway.” Not only the Monroe Doctrine but also “our prosperity and safety” required, as Hayes put it, that “either an American canal or no canal must be our motto.” To underline his point in 1880, he ordered two warships to sail along the coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.19","['the 1860s', '1878', '1879', '1880']",evart work seward 1860s entice investor canal project secretary state 1878 warn europeans intervene central america collect debt – key precedent 1904 roosevelt corollary monroe doctrine lead united state police hemisphere quest crisis 1879 ferdinand de lesseps build suez canal announce french firm construct panamanian route evart haye warn president ’s word “ united state control great highway ” monroe doctrine “ prosperity safety ” require haye “ canal canal motto ” underline point 1880 order warship sail coast nicaragua panama.19,81,"[1860, 1878, 1879, 1880]",1874,4,1875,1900
459,"Blaine then took the major step of telling the British in 1881 that the 1850 treaty had to be changed to American specifications. He argued that the United States now enjoyed paramount interests in the area – especially because of the growth of the U.S. Pacific Coast states – that were “imperial in extent” and required easy transit for the growing export trade. Blaine also informed the British government that “England as against the United States was always wrong.” Such sentiments, along with his continual twisting of the Lion’s tail in presidential campaigns to obtain the Irish vote, finally made him persona non grata in the British prime minister’s office. Shorn of the campaign rhetoric, Blaine had nevertheless predicted the outcome. His successor in the State Department, Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, simply ignored the 1850 agreement and in 1884 signed the Frelinghuysen-Zavala Treaty with Nicaragua, which gave the United States exclusive canal rights. The Senate voted 32–23 to ratify the treaty, short of the necessary two-thirds. The majority, however, plus the strict party-line vote (the Republicans were enthusiastically for the treaty), indicated that the days of the 1850 pact were numbered. Or, as Andrew Carnegie wrote Blaine in 1882, “You are exactly right. America is going to control anything and everything on this Continent. That’s settled…. No joint arrangements, no entangling alliances with monarchical, war-like Europe.

Presidents and Congress, led by Alabama senator John T. Morgan, continued to warn, as President Benjamin Harrison put it in 1891, that “the canal is the most important subject now connected with the commercial growth and progress of the United States.” The U.S. navy, moreover, intervened in Panama on at least seven occasions between 1846 and 1903 to protect U.S. interests.

To Blaine, however, the higher stakes included Great Britain’s trade advantages in, and strong support for, Chile. Above all, he and Frelinghuysen wanted to keep European powers as uninvolved as possible. To accomplish this, Blaine decided in 1881 that U.S. commercial dominance in the hemisphere required stopping wars that Europeans could exploit.22 Peace, he argued, was a prerequisite for American commerce, at least until the United States had enough power itself to determine, and take advantage of, the outbreaks.","['1879', '1883', '1881']",addition colombia ’s province panama part latin america upheaval call pacific war erupt 1879 last 1883 chile peru especially distressed u.s official war cause ancient rivalry fight pacific coast outlet contested guano bed blaine high stake include great britain ’s trade advantage strong support chile frelinghuysen want european power uninvolved possible accomplish blaine decide 1881 u.s commercial dominance hemisphere require stopping war europeans exploit.22 peace argue prerequisite commerce united state power determine advantage outbreak,74,"[1879, 1883, 1881]",1881,3,1900,1900
462,"Blaine therefore invited the Latin American states to discuss these subjects at a historic conference in Washington. He left the department after President James Garfleld’s death in 1881, and the conference did not convene. But others, including Bayard and members of both parties in Congress, as well as powerful members of the business community, including Carnegie, maintained strong interest in such a meeting. Bayard issued fresh invitations just before Blaine returned to the State Department in 1889. The first Pan-American conference of that year indeed marked a turning point in hemispheric relationships, even if it did not achieve all that Blaine had hoped. In the 1820s Henry Clay had coined the term “good neighbor” to describe the correct approach to the Americas, and one of Blaine’s friends learned that he “regarded Henry Clay as the originator of the ideas relating to the subject” of Latin American policy. The Good Neighbor approach in the 1889–90 conference produced an arbitration convention to help settle disputes, a recommendation to build a railroad uniting North and South America, and the establishment of the Commercial Bureau of American Republics (or the Pan American Union, as it later became known). The conference rejected the idea of a common silver coin. Most notably, the Latin Americans turned down Blaine’s idea of a customs union. The tariff policy of the United States and their historic economic ties to Europe, the Southern delegates argued, made a hemispheric common market impossible.23","['1881', '1889', 'that year', 'the 1820s']",blaine invite latin state discuss subject historic conference washington leave department president james garfleld ’s death 1881 conference convene include bayard member party congress powerful member business community include carnegie maintain strong interest meeting bayard issue fresh invitation blaine return state department 1889 pan conference year mark turning point hemispheric relationship achieve blaine hop 1820s henry clay coin term “ good neighbor ” describe correct approach america blaine ’s friend learn “ regard henry clay originator idea relate subject ” latin policy good neighbor approach 1889–90 conference produce arbitration convention help settle dispute recommendation build railroad unite north south america establishment commercial bureau republic pan union later know conference reject idea common silver coin notably latin american turn blaine ’s idea custom union tariff policy united state historic economic tie europe southern delegate argue hemispheric common market impossible.23,138,"[1881, 1889, 1820]",1863,3,1875,1900
463," Above all, Blaine emerged from the fight over the customs union determined to bring the high post-1861 tariffs into accord with the economic realities of the 1890s. The realities were that the United States was producing a huge glut of industrial goods that had natural markets to the south; the Europeans, led by the British and the Germans, were instead grabbing those markets; and the United States consequently had an unfavorable balance of trade (and an outflow of money to pay for it) because of its economic dependence on Latin American raw materials. Blaine did not think small. A consummate back-room wheeler-dealer and stump orator, “the Plumed Knight from Maine,” like Seward, developed a systematic worldview. (He even liked to amuse himself in his study by spinning a world globe and contemplating its future.) Having taught Virgil, Cicero, and mathematics at Western Military Institute at age eighteen, Blaine served in Congress seventeen years, including seven as the powerful Speaker of the House. Republican nominee for the presidency in 1884, he seemed to be the front-runner for the nomination in 1888 until Civil War hero Benjamin Harrison, aided by Blainer’s growing number of enemies and ill health, won the nomination and the office. The two men mistrusted each other, but Harrison respected Blaine’s power and vision. When he invited the Plumed Knight to become secretary of state, the president-elect wrote, “I am especially interested in the improvement of our relations with the Central and South American states.” In 1886, Blaine had outlined his view of those relations:","['the 1890s', 'age eighteen', 'seventeen years', '1884', '1888', '1886']",blaine emerge fight custom union determine bring high post-1861 tariff accord economic reality 1890s reality united state produce huge glut industrial good natural market south europeans lead british german instead grab market united state consequently unfavorable balance trade outflow money pay economic dependence latin raw material blaine think small consummate room wheeler dealer stump orator “ plumed knight maine ” like seward develop systematic worldview like amuse study spin world globe contemplate future have teach virgil cicero mathematic western military institute age eighteen blaine serve congress seventeen year include seven powerful speaker house republican nominee presidency 1884 runner nomination 1888 civil war hero benjamin harrison aid blainer ’s grow number enemy ill health win nomination office man mistrust harrison respect blaine ’s power vision invite plumed knight secretary state president elect write “ especially interested improvement relation central south state ” 1886 blaine outline view relation,146,"[1890, 1884, 1888, 1886]",1887,4,1900,1900
464,"Blaine had little patience for laissez-faire illusions. He knew that trade moved not because “of a mere ability to produce as cheaply as another nation” but because of “special trade relations by treaty.” Politics (including tariffs and the Civil War mercantilist acts, which had accelerated industrialization), not an imaginary open marketplace, determined power. As one journalist observed, “It was Blaine who had the big idea that water could be made to run uphill; or, what was the same thing, that trade currents could be diverted from their natural courses.” A half-dozen treaties with reciprocity clauses had been made with Latin American nations in the early 1880s; the argument went on as well about whether to renew the 1854 reciprocity pact with Canada. But the 1890 McKinley Tariff, which contained the Blaine-Harrison reciprocity provisions, was different.25","['the early 1880s', '1890']",blaine little patience laissez faire illusion know trade move “ mere ability produce cheaply nation “ special trade relation treaty ” politic include tariff civil war mercantilist act accelerate industrialization imaginary open marketplace determine power journalist observe “ blaine big idea water run uphill thing trade current divert natural course ” half dozen treaty reciprocity clause latin nation early 1880s argument go renew 1854 reciprocity pact canada 1890 mckinley tariff contain blaine harrison reciprocity provision different.25,76,"[1880, 1890]",1885,2,1900,1900
465,"It anticipated the key principle of U.S. trade policy in most of the twentieth century by enabling the president to reduce tariffs on foreign goods (particularly raw materials) when other nations reduced their tariffs for U.S. products (especially industrial and staple agricultural goods). The act was constructed as a blunt weapon: The five key articles of sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, and hides were to be allowed in duty-free, but if a country producing those goods did not reciprocate by allowing in U.S. goods at preferential rates, the president could slap heavy duties on the five articles exported by the recalcitrant country. Harrison did the major political work during the hot Washington summer of 1890 in pushing the legislation through a protectionist Republican Congress, while the ailing Blaine took in the sea breezes at Bar Harbor.26","['the twentieth century', 'summer of 1890']",anticipate key principle u.s trade policy twentieth century enable president reduce tariff foreign good particularly raw material nation reduce tariff u.s product especially industrial staple agricultural good act construct blunt weapon key article sugar molass coffee tea hide allow duty free country produce good reciprocate allow u.s good preferential rate president slap heavy duty article export recalcitrant country harrison major political work hot washington summer 1890 push legislation protectionist republican congress ail blaine take sea breeze bar harbor.26,78,[1890],1890,1,1900,1900
466,"Economic historians have judged the act a failure because treaties were negotiated with only eleven nations, and the Democrats repealed the reciprocity provisions in favor of an across-the-board freer trade measure in 1894. That judgment, however, is myopic. As Blaine and Harrison intended, the treaties created important new trade with Spanish and British colonial holdings in the New World (how better to wean Cuba, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and other colonial possessions from their parents?), with all five Central American nations, and with Brazil. Of special note, Harrison used the treaty as a club to coerce Germany. The Germans had begun in 1879 to protect their farmers by prohibiting U.S. pork imports on the grounds the pork was contaminated with trichinosis. Berlin then pressured other Europeans to follow its lead. Some 1.2 billion pounds of U.S. pork exports were suddenly jeopardized. Washington’s protests went largely unheeded until 1891, when Harrison threatened to impose prohibitive tariffs on large beet-sugar imports from Germany. Berlin then responded more agreeably. Harrison improved U.S. inspections of meat exports, and, at the president’s demand, Germany reduced its tariff on U.S. exports other than pork. When Colombia, Haiti, and Venezuela refused to be as cooperative, Harrison penalized their exports to the United States.27","['1894', '1879', '1891']",economic historian judge act failure treaty negotiate nation democrats repeal reciprocity provision favor board free trade measure 1894 judgment myopic blaine harrison intend treaty create important new trade spanish british colonial holding new world good wean cuba puerto rico jamaica colonial possession parent central nation brazil special note harrison treaty club coerce germany germans begin 1879 protect farmer prohibit u.s pork import ground pork contaminate trichinosis berlin pressure european follow lead 1.2 billion pound u.s pork export suddenly jeopardize washington ’s protest go largely unheed 1891 harrison threaten impose prohibitive tariff large beet sugar import germany berlin respond agreeably harrison improve u.s inspection meat export president ’s demand germany reduce tariff u.s export pork colombia haiti venezuela refuse cooperative harrison penalize export united states.27,124,"[1894, 1879, 1891]",1888,3,1900,1900
467,"Harrison was completing Blaine’s Good Neighbor approach by threatening to declare economic war on the uncooperative or by using economic war to obtain long-sought prizes. Canada, in the view of Blaine and Harrison, was one of the greatest prizes. They wanted to annex it but to do so only after the Canadians voluntarily asked to join the Union. Reciprocity seemed to offer a no-lose policy: If Canada signed such a trade treaty, it would slowly be integrated into the United States. If it did not, the many Canadians who depended on the U.S. market (both Blaine and Harrison kept in close touch with such people) would demand either a treaty on Washington’s terms or annexation. Sir Alexander Gait, Canada’s leading financial expert, declared that the 1890 tariff act was aimed at forcing Canada to break its “Colonial connection” with Great Britain and further claimed it was “a hostile measure – an act of commercial war.” Gait was correct. Blaine urged Harrison not even to approach Canada for a reciprocity treaty, because it could not be worked out to U.S. satisfaction. Canada, he added, would then “find that she has a hard row to hoe and will ultimately … seek admission to the Union.” Blaine was wrong. After a bitter political battle, Canadian Conservatives triumphed over Liberal continentalists in 1892 and turned toward Great Britain. U.S. officials had lost this battle.28","['–', '1892']",harrison complete blaine ’s good neighbor approach threaten declare economic war uncooperative economic war obtain long seek prize canada view blaine harrison great prize want annex canadians voluntarily ask join union reciprocity offer lose policy canada sign trade treaty slowly integrate united state canadian depend u.s market blaine harrison keep close touch people demand treaty washington ’s term annexation sir alexander gait canada ’s leading financial expert declare 1890 tariff act aim force canada break “ colonial connection ” great britain claim “ hostile measure – act commercial war ” gait correct blaine urge harrison approach canada reciprocity treaty work u.s satisfaction canada add “ find hard row hoe ultimately … seek admission union ” blaine wrong bitter political battle canadian conservative triumph liberal continentalist 1892 turn great britain u.s official lose battle.28,133,[1892],1892,1,1900,1900
468,"They succeeded spectacularly, however, in their quest for Hawaii and, ultimately, Cuba. When Harrison signed a reciprocity treaty with Spain to give free access for Cuban sugar, the result quickly cut lethally in two directions. One was sketched out by Carnegie as he gloried in the disorder that would afflict Cuba. Noting that “all classes” on the island were in an “uproar” to sell to the United States, the steelmaker concluded that Cuba would “become the source of serious trouble and danger to Spain.” Indeed, when the 1894 tariff ended reciprocity and removed Cuban sugar’s favored access to U.S. markets, the island spun into revolution. Hawaii’s revolt occurred in 1893 precisely because Cuban sugar had replaced its own in U.S. markets as a result of the 1890 act. The white planters, with the help of U.S. sailors, deposed the Hawaiian king, and then asked for annexation and access to the continent’s markets.29 The Americans’ search for disorder had paid off handsomely.","['1894', '1893', '1890']",succeed spectacularly quest hawaii ultimately cuba harrison sign reciprocity treaty spain free access cuban sugar result quickly cut lethally direction sketch carnegie glory disorder afflict cuba note “ class ” island “ uproar ” sell united state steelmaker conclude cuba “ source trouble danger spain ” 1894 tariff end reciprocity remove cuban sugar ’s favored access u.s market island spin revolution hawaii ’s revolt occur 1893 precisely cuban sugar replace u.s market result 1890 act white planter help u.s sailor depose hawaiian king ask annexation access continent ’s markets.29 americans’ search disorder pay handsomely,94,"[1894, 1893, 1890]",1892,3,1900,1900

In 1886, the Chilean government of José Manuel Balmaceda moved closer to Washington and farther from dominant British influences, especially in the economic realm. Trade improved, and U.S. investors moved into the nitrate and shipping businesses. When a revolt erupted against Balmaceda in early 1891, Blaine supported the government, not least because the rebels were painted as pro-British by U.S. minister Patrick Egan.","['the early 1880s', '1886', 'early 1891']",animosity arise chile united state early 1880 call pacific war peru chile try seize dispute territory washington try mediator favor peru 1886 chilean government josé manuel balmaceda move closer washington farther dominant british influence especially economic realm trade improve u.s investor move nitrate shipping business revolt erupt balmaceda early 1891 blaine support government rebel paint pro british u.s minister patrick egan,61,"[1880, 1886, 1891]",1886,3,1900,1900

The United States, much to Harrison’s disgust, had to pay costs for the ship seizure. Anti-Yankee feelings spread in Chile until October 1891, when two U.S. sailors were killed and seventeen seriously wounded in a Santiago barroom brawl. War threatened as Harrison became more demanding and the new Chilean regime grew sensitive to its nation’s anti-U.S. feelings. Blaine finally moderated Harrison’s position. So did the realization, when the president ordered the navy ready for action, that the fleet was weaker than Chile’s.

In his inaugural, the president observed that U.S. interests were no longer “exclusively American”; U.S. interests and citizens abroad were to be protected. “The necessities of our navy require convenient coaling stations and dock and harbor privileges.” In 1891 he told a friend that bases in Europe and Africa were not needed, but it was “very important that in the West Indies, in the Pacific islands, South America we should have such stations.”31",['1891'],loud demand new navy shipping base – demand grow crisis burgeon u.s commerce – note harrison blaine inaugural president observe u.s interest longer “ exclusively ” u.s interest citizen abroad protect “ necessity navy require convenient coaling station dock harbor privilege ” 1891 tell friend base europe africa need “ important west indie pacific island south america stations.”31,58,[1891],1891,1,1900,1900
474,"An opportunity to seize such a station arose in Haiti when a revolution split the country between a northern pro-U.S. group and a southern faction supported by European interests. The northern group, led by Hyppolite, won, and Harrison instructed U.S. minister Frederick Douglass to ask the new government to show its appreciation by leasing the fine harbor of Môle St. Nicholas to Washington. At the same time, the U.S.-owned Clyde Steamship Line approached the Haitian government for choice shipping routes and a $480,000 subsidy. The Haitians, Douglass reported, refused to lease their territory or submit to Clyde’s demands. Blaine dispatched Rear Admiral Bancroft Gherardi to apply pressure. The admiral complained that as an African American, Douglass was too sensitive to Haitian concerns; the talks needed an “able, vigorous, aggressive white man.” Douglass was recalled in 1891, but Haiti refused to change its position, even for such an aggressive white man as Gherardi.32",['1891'],"opportunity seize station arise haiti revolution split country northern pro u.s group southern faction support european interest northern group lead hyppolite win harrison instruct u.s minister frederick douglass ask new government appreciation lease fine harbor môle st nicholas washington time u.s .- own clyde steamship line approach haitian government choice shipping route 480,000 subsidy haitian douglass report refuse lease territory submit clyde ’s demand blaine dispatch rear admiral bancroft gherardi apply pressure admiral complain african douglass sensitive haitian concern talk need “ able vigorous aggressive white man ” douglass recall 1891 haiti refuse change position aggressive white man gherardi.32",99,[1891],1891,1,1900,1900
475,"Harrison and Blaine, resembling Seward before them, did not obtain the Caribbean bases they sought. They did, however, pass the reciprocity bill and a battleship measure that helped obtain the empire that was acquired after 1897. They also gave glimmerings of the post-1898 executive power that was to transform the Constitution’s checks and balances by cutting drastically the congressional domination of foreign policy that had occurred between 1865 and the 1890s. Harrison’s authority to negotiate reciprocity treaties was one indication. The Chilean crisis revealed how the executive could seize upon an incident and take the country toward war with little congressional consultation. In the 1880s, moreover, modern intelligence services, operating under the president’s direction, were created when the Military Information Division appeared, and the navy named four officers to the Office of Intelligence to oversee global affairs. In 1889, Congress created the army and navy attaché system to staff diplomatic outposts with professional military officers. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, declared in a landmark decision, In re Neagle (a case that had nothing directly to do with foreign affairs), that the president’s power was not limited to carrying out Congress’s wishes, but extended to enforcing “the rights, duties, and obligations growing out of the Constitution itself, our international relations, and all the protection implied by the nature of the government under the Constitution.”33 These explosive words of 1890 anticipated the nearly open-ended power of the post-1898 presidency, much as U.S. policies in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America between 1865 and 1893 anticipated, and helped cause, post-1898 instability and even revolution.","['1897', 'post-1898', 'between 1865 and the 1890s', 'the 1880s', '1889', '1890', 'post-1898', 'between 1865 and 1893', 'post-1898']",harrison blaine resemble seward obtain caribbean base seek pass reciprocity bill battleship measure help obtain empire acquire 1897 give glimmering post-1898 executive power transform constitution ’s check balance cut drastically congressional domination foreign policy occur 1865 1890s harrison ’s authority negotiate reciprocity treaty indication chilean crisis reveal executive seize incident country war little congressional consultation 1880 modern intelligence service operate president ’s direction create military information division appear navy name officer office intelligence oversee global affair 1889 congress create army navy attaché system staff diplomatic outpost professional military officer supreme court declare landmark decision neagle case directly foreign affair president ’s power limit carry congress ’s wish extend enforce “ right duty obligation grow constitution international relation protection imply nature government constitution.”33 explosive word 1890 anticipate nearly open end power post-1898 presidency u.s policy mexico caribbean central america 1865 1893 anticipate help because post-1898 instability revolution,146,"[1897, 1898, 1880, 1889, 1890, 1898, 1898]",1893,7,1900,1900

A decade later, driven again in part by the economic bad times of 1837 to 1841, U.S. officials signed their first treaty with China.

Convinced that the region was to be the “great commercial prize of the world,” he renewed ties with Liberia; gained rights to a coaling station on the other side of the continent, at Madagascar, where U.S. merchants for a time dominated the island’s profitable trade; and signed trade treaties with African leaders. In his reports home, Shufeldt told Secretary of State William Evarts that U.S. consular services (a topic close to Evarts’s heart) should be established along the coasts, especially because “we must bear in mind that with the old markets overstocked with goods,” it was necessary to take “time by the forelock” and gain a share of “the only remaining unoccupied mart in the old world, … the virgin soil of Africa with its teeming population.”1","['1870', '1878']",africa burst america ’s world ’s attention 1870 new york herald send henry m. stanley find supposedly lose missionary david livingstone interior africa stanley ’s alleged greeting “ dr livingstone presume ” famous stanley ’s discovery congo ’s rich mineral wealth receive considerably devoted attention time 1878 great u.s explorer rear admiral robert shufeldt sail west african coast river convinced region “ great commercial prize world ” renew tie liberia gain right coaling station continent madagascar u.s merchant time dominate island ’s profitable trade sign trade treaty african leader report home shufeldt tell secretary state william evart u.s consular service topic close evart ’s heart establish coast especially “ bear mind old market overstock good ” necessary “ time forelock ” gain share “ remain unoccupied mart old world … virgin soil africa teem population.”1,135,"[1870, 1878]",1874,2,1875,1900

The powers were well on their way to controlling more than 150 million people and 10 million square miles of territory (about one-fifth of the world’s land) that they conquered between 1870 and 1900.","['the early 1890s', 'between 1870 and 1900']",morgan arthur receive key support john kasson u.s minister austria hungary kasson close view european power struggle control potential colonial area early 1890 british fight afghanistan occupy egypt sudan establish protectorate sub saharan africa french take tahiti extend domination part southeast asia germany take togo southwest africa move zanzibar tanganyika samoa power way control 150 million people 10 million square mile territory fifth world ’s land conquer 1870 1900,69,[1890],1890,1,1900,1900
481,"Kasson was one of many influential Americans who used their Old World vantage point to keep people back home informed about European affairs. Some of them were widely read novelists. The international novel developed with the books of Henry James and Edith Wharton. Even Bret Harte, famous for his California frontier stories, moved to Europe in 1878, became a U.S. consul, settled in London, and never returned to the United States. Ties of literature were reinforced with transatlantic marriages and increased travel by young people with well-known names such as Roosevelt, Lodge, Adams, and Hay. Travel books, not least those by James and Mark Twain, were highly popular. Kasson, who had traveled widely in the 1860s on international business, became one of many who acted as conduits in the growing exchange of views and biases between Americans and Europeans that marked the era.3","['1878', 'the 1860s']",kasson influential american old world vantage point people home inform european affair widely read novelist international novel develop book henry james edith wharton bret harte famous california frontier story move europe 1878 u.s consul settle london return united state tie literature reinforce transatlantic marriage increase travel young people know name roosevelt lodge adams hay travel book jame mark twain highly popular kasson travel widely 1860s international business act conduit grow exchange view bias american europeans mark era.3,77,"[1878, 1860]",1869,2,1875,1900
482,"In 1884, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck moved to stop the growing struggle over the Congo by calling a conference in Berlin. President Arthur and Secretary of State Frederick Frelinghuysen, breaking the historic U.S. policy of not becoming involved in European conferences, sent Kasson as Washington’s delegate. The U.S. position was to support Leopold’s claims against opposition from the French and Portuguese and, above all, to parlay the Belgian king’s promises into a guaranteed Open Door for U.S. interests in the Congo. (Kasson also wanted a U.S. base on the tiny Atlantic coast of the Congo, but Frelinghuysen thought that went too far, although he did order a U.S. naval commander to search out a spot for “a commercial resort.”) The U.S. position, which was virtually identical with Leopold’s, thanks to Kasson and Morgan, was written into the treaty. Kasson was elated. The Senate was not. Despite Morgan’s pleading, the body disliked what it saw as an entangling alliance. James G. Blaine, the Republican presidential nominee in 1884, criticized the outgoing Republican administration for signing a treaty that obliterated the separation of the Old and New Worlds and consequently destroyed a key assumption, he claimed, of the Monroe Doctrine. In 1885, the new Democratic president, Grover Cleveland, withdrew the treaty.5","['1884', '1884', '1885']",1884 german chancellor otto von bismarck move stop grow struggle congo call conference berlin president arthur secretary state frederick frelinghuysen break historic u.s policy involved european conference send kasson washington ’s delegate u.s position support leopold ’s claim opposition french portuguese parlay belgian king ’s promise guarantee open door u.s interest congo kasson want u.s base tiny atlantic coast congo frelinghuysen think go far order u.s naval commander search spot “ commercial resort ” u.s position virtually identical leopold ’s thank kasson morgan write treaty kasson elated senate despite morgan ’s pleading body dislike see entangle alliance james g. blaine republican presidential nominee 1884 criticize outgoing republican administration sign treaty obliterate separation old new world consequently destroy key assumption claim monroe doctrine 1885 new democratic president grover cleveland withdraw treaty.5,130,"[1884, 1884, 1885]",1884,3,1900,1900
483,"The Congo problem, however, did not disappear as a political and even religious concern. Nor, by any means, did Leopold’s promises and the Open Door principle bring order and hope to West Africa. The Belgians’ brutality was first revealed by George Washington Williams in his “Open Letter” of 1890. An editor, pastor, and appointee as U.S. minister to Haiti (although he never served), Williams was the first African American elected to the Ohio legislature and the first scholarly black historian. Williams’s “Open Letter” scandalized Europe and enlightened Americans by making dozens of well-substantiated charges against Leopold, who had unjustly seized the Congolese land, “burned their towns, stolen their property, [and] enslaved their women and children,” but had done nothing to educate or improve their lives economically. Williams’s spectacular charges forced even the president, the glacial Benjamin Harrison, to come out against Leopold’s depredations.

484,"Other African Americans became quite differently involved. Missionary publications had long been taking credit for bringing their light to the so-called dark continent. The New York Herald, with its highly sensitive nose for profitable imperialism, bragged that in Africa the missionaries and merchants worked as teams to destroy Islamic beliefs. One missionary took a different tack. William Henry Sheppard had graduated from Stillman College, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, which the Southern Presbyterian Church had built to train African American missionaries. From a middle-class Virginia family, Sheppard worked easily with whites and joined Samuel Lapsley on a missionary trip to the Congo in 1890. Sheppard worked with African leaders, and Lapsley with the white officials, to produce a flourishing mission. Sheppard became highly knowledgeable about, and sensitive to, the Africans’ customs. He returned to the United States to recruit more missionaries, including African Americans, to work in the Congo. By 1899 the missionaries were educating U.S. churches about the Belgian practice of taking a “goodly number” of the “people around us here” for forced, state labor. They also revealed how Leopold used the feared Zappo-Zap tribe to collect taxes, while the Zappo-Zaps used Leopold’s relationship as a cover for their own slave raids. The resulting uproar finally forced the State Department to protest to the king. In 1909, the Belgian company sued Sheppard for libel. In an internationally watched trial, the missionary was exonerated. As trade developed between white Americans and the Congo, so, for quite different reasons, did links between Africans and African Americans.7","['1890', '1899', '1909']",african american differently involve missionary publication long take credit bring light call dark continent new york herald highly sensitive nose profitable imperialism brag africa missionary merchant work team destroy islamic belief missionary take different tack william henry sheppard graduate stillman college tuscaloosa alabama southern presbyterian church build train african missionary middle class virginia family sheppard work easily white join samuel lapsley missionary trip congo 1890 sheppard work african leader lapsley white official produce flourish mission sheppard highly knowledgeable sensitive africans’ custom return united state recruit missionary include african american work congo 1899 missionary educate u.s church belgian practice take “ goodly number ” “ people force state labor reveal leopold fear zappo zap tribe collect tax zappo zap leopold ’s relationship cover slave raid result uproar finally force state department protest king 1909 belgian company sue sheppard libel internationally watch trial missionary exonerate trade develop white american congo different reason link african african americans.7,154,"[1890, 1899, 1909]",1899,3,1900,1900

And as in Africa, so the hope evolved that as a strategic base Samoa would help guard the routes to Asia to relieve the growing glut of U.S. goods.

486,"In 1872, Navy Commander Richard W. Meade signed the first U.S. treaty with Samoan native chieftains. American firms and land speculators had arrived earlier, but Meade was primarily interested in the fine, protected harbor of Pago Pago, for which he received a lease in return for a protectorate. The Samoans, rightly fearing British and German attention, were playing off foreigner against foreigner. The Senate accepted the harbor but rejected the responsibility of a protectorate. A modified pact simply offered U.S. good offices in return for Pago Pago, and this proved more acceptable. In reality, the U.S., British, and German consuls worked out a tripartite agreement in 1879 that Secretary of State Evarts did not bother to place at the Senate’s mercy. The arrangement existed for the next eight years, although not without growing conflict between U.S. and German claims. In 1885, Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard warned Berlin that he would “not allow any one power to have a commercial preference,” and, somewhat contradictorily, demanded independence for Samoans. In 1886, Great Britain secretly supported German claims in return for Bismarck’s supporting London’s position in Egypt.8 The United States was becoming enmeshed in those European quarrels about which Washington and Jefferson had warned.","['1872', '1879', 'the next eight years', '1885', '1886']",1872 navy commander richard w. meade sign u.s treaty samoan native chieftain firm land speculator arrive earlier meade primarily interested fine protect harbor pago pago receive lease return protectorate samoans rightly fear british german attention play foreigner foreigner senate accept harbor reject responsibility protectorate modify pact simply offer u.s good office return pago pago prove acceptable reality u.s british german consul work tripartite agreement 1879 secretary state evart bother place senate ’s mercy arrangement exist year grow conflict u.s german claim 1885 secretary state thomas f. bayard warn berlin “ allow power commercial preference ” somewhat contradictorily demand independence samoan 1886 great britain secretly support german claim return bismarck ’s support london ’s position egypt.8 united state enmesh european quarrel washington jefferson warn,123,"[1872, 1879, 1885, 1886]",1880,4,1900,1900
487," This generation of U.S. officials, however, thought it was necessary to stand and fight. With the British in Germany’s pocket on the Samoan question, the three powers met at Washington in 1887 to sort out the imperial claims. Bayard beat down German plans for de facto control with the argument that in U.S. eyes, Samoan ports were a vital link in the system that connected the U.S. railroad network to Asia – especially if an isthmian canal was built. In part because of the daily 100-plus degrees of a Washington summer, but mostly because of the growing rivalry, nothing came out of the conference. In 1888 Germany moved more directly to seize power. Samoans captured a number of German soldiers (and beheaded some), but Bismarck’s grip had tightened. American opinion flared, led by business groups such as the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, which darkly warned that if Samoa fell to the Germans, Hawaii would be next. Washington prepared to send a warship. The Iron Chancellor wondered aloud why Americans were so concerned about these “remote, inconsiderable islands.” In a note to Bayard, Second Assistant Secretary of State Alvey A. Adee outlined the geopolitics of a rising Pacific empire:","['1887', 'daily', 'summer', '1888']",generation u.s official think necessary stand fight british germany ’s pocket samoan question power meet washington 1887 sort imperial claim bayard beat german plan de facto control argument u.s eye samoan port vital link system connect u.s railroad network asia – especially isthmian canal build daily 100-plus degree washington summer grow rivalry come conference 1888 germany move directly seize power samoan capture number german soldier behead bismarck ’s grip tighten opinion flare lead business group san francisco chamber commerce darkly warn samoa fall german hawaii washington prepare send warship iron chancellor wonder aloud american concerned “ remote inconsiderable island ” note bayard second assistant secretary state alvey a. adee outline geopolitic rise pacific empire,114,"[1887, 1888]",1888,2,1900,1900

Before it could convene, the three nations’ warships, whose sailors had been staring each other down in Apia harbor, were struck by a mighty hurricane. Of the thirteen warships, only one British vessel escaped to open water and survived. Properly chastened by near war and nature, the three nations worked out a three-power protectorate at Berlin. The United States received its main demand: its own protectorate over Pago Pago harbor. The crisis calmed until after the 1898 war, when the powers’ struggle over China again drew attention to Samoa. In 1899, the British, preoccupied with the Boer War in South Africa, pulled out. The United States and Germany divided the islands, with the Americans obtaining Pago Pago. American Samoa resulted from the clear U.S. choice of standing firm – for commercial and strategic reasons – regardless of instability, civil conflict, near war, and the danger of becoming embroiled in European colonial quarrels.

489,"American missionaries arrived in Hawaii after 1819 to find the land owned in a type of feudal system with the king as feudal lord. The missionaries converted Hawaiian rulers to Christianity, became the kings’ translators and advisers, and by 1849 had the power to destroy the traditional land system and kin-based production. In their place appeared, by missionary-inspired law, yeoman farmers, wage laborers, and, most notably, vast opportunities for buying up the land. By the 1850s sixteen Congregationalist missionaries held land titles that averaged 493 acres per person. By 1892, Americans and Europeans owned two-thirds of Hawaii. The U.S. consul called the missionaries the “bloodsuckers of the community,” living “like lords” and “disturbing the minds of these children of Nature.” Seward had failed to lock up Washington’s control of the islands with a reciprocity treaty in 1867, but the U.S. consul nevertheless reported in 1871 that the most-heard songs on Hawaiian streets were “Marching Through Georgia” and “John Brown’s Body.” Hawaiian control of Hawaii was fast slipping away. In 1876, Secretary of State Hamilton Fish finally pushed a reciprocity treaty through the Senate. Fish emphasized not the economic benefits, but the warning that if the United States did not tighten its grip on the islands, Great Britain and Canada would do so.11 The treaty’s effects were electric.","['1849', 'the 1850s sixteen', '1892', '1867', '1871', '1876']",missionary arrive hawaii 1819 find land own type feudal system king feudal lord missionary convert hawaiian ruler christianity kings’ translator adviser 1849 power destroy traditional land system kin base production place appear missionary inspire law yeoman farmer wage laborer notably vast opportunity buy land 1850s sixteen congregationalist missionary hold land title average 493 acre person 1892 american europeans own third hawaii u.s consul call missionary “ bloodsucker community ” live “ like lord ” “ disturb mind child nature ” seward fail lock washington ’s control island reciprocity treaty 1867 u.s consul report 1871 hear song hawaiian street “ marching georgia ” “ john brown ’s body ” hawaiian control hawaii fast slip away 1876 secretary state hamilton fish finally push reciprocity treaty senate fish emphasize economic benefit warning united state tighten grip island great britain canada so.11 treaty ’s effect electric,142,"[1849, 1850, 1892, 1867, 1871, 1876]",1868,6,1875,1900

Plantations tripled in number during the four years after 1876, and two-thirds of all sugar property was held by Americans. Hawaiian sugar moved so quickly into the U.S. market that American beet-sugar producers and East Coast refiners formed a phalanx with protectionists to kill renewal of the treaty in 1883. They failed. As usual, James G. Blaine had well explained the course of the nation’s empire and described why the opponents’ efforts were doomed: The 1876 treaty, the secretary of state said in 1881, made Hawaiians “practically members of an American Zollverein in an outlying district of the state of California.” It was time, Blaine added, to quit evading responsibility and annex the islands before native rulers caused problems. Then U.S. capital and “intelligent workers” could develop Hawaii in “a purely American form of colonization.” Blaine believed the United States had no use for bases in Africa, the Indian Ocean, or the Danish West Indies, but three places should be taken: Hawaii, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. The last two would not be ripe “for a generation,” but Hawaii might “come up for decisions at any unexpected hour.”12","['Between 1876 and 1885', 'annual', 'the four years after 1876', '1883', '1876', '1881', 'The last two']",1876 1885 annual sugar production soar 26 million pound 1.3 million value 171 million pound 8.4 million plantation triple number year 1876 third sugar property hold american hawaiian sugar move quickly u.s market beet sugar producer east coast refiner form phalanx protectionist kill renewal treaty 1883 fail usual james g. blaine explain course nation ’s empire describe opponents’ effort doom 1876 treaty secretary state say 1881 hawaiian “ practically member zollverein outlying district state california ” time blaine add quit evade responsibility annex island native ruler cause problem u.s capital “ intelligent worker ” develop hawaii “ purely form colonization ” blaine believe united state use base africa indian ocean danish west indie place take hawaii cuba puerto rico ripe “ generation ” hawaii “ come decision unexpected hour.”12,129,"[1876, 1883, 1876, 1881]",1879,4,1900,1900
491,"When the renewal struggle began in 1886, President Grover Cleveland and Secretary of State Thomas Bayard, not usually known for jingoistic foreign policies, fought and won an all-out battle against opponents led by well-heeled domestic sugar interests. Cleveland further sweetened the treaty by obtaining an exclusive right to Pearl Harbor, an undeveloped but (as many observers pointed out) magnificent protected port on Oahu Island. The Hawaiians, helped along by British and Canadian officials, had opposed renewal because their sovereignty was disappearing, but the foreign planters and their political allies pressured the king to offer Pearl Harbor and then agree to a new treaty. Cleveland knew what was at stake in Hawaii: “Our close and manifest interest in the commerce of the Pacific Ocean upon which we hold the most important seaboard, renders the Hawaiian group of essential importance to us on every score.” Bayard added the usual argument that if the United States rejected the islands, other powers would gladly step in to take them.13",['1886'],renewal struggle begin 1886 president grover cleveland secretary state thomas bayard usually know jingoistic foreign policy fight win battle opponent lead heel domestic sugar interest cleveland sweeten treaty obtain exclusive right pearl harbor undeveloped observer point magnificent protect port oahu island hawaiian help british canadian official oppose renewal sovereignty disappear foreign planter political ally pressure king offer pearl harbor agree new treaty cleveland know stake hawaii “ close manifest interest commerce pacific ocean hold important seaboard render hawaiian group essential importance score ” bayard add usual argument united state reject island power gladly step them.13,95,[1886],1886,1,1900,1900

In what they termed a “revolution,” they demanded that a weak king, Kalakaua, sign a new constitution turning de facto control over to whites who had sufficient property qualifications. Bayard helped. He gave the U.S. minister a blank check to aid the white planters fully, including, by inference, the landing of American troops if necessary. They were not needed in 1887 but landed two years later during an outbreak. In 1890 the annexationists lost their control of the government. Led by Lorrin A. Thurston, who had masterminded the 1887 takeover, they now secretly prepared a second “revolution.” Meanwhile, Canadian Pacific Railroad and British interests became more prominent. The British minister to the United States, Julian Pauncefote, suggested to Secretary of State Blaine in 1890 that both nations pledge to ensure Hawaiian independence. “Mr. Blaine,” Pauncefote recalled, “in a very emphatic way said the United States would do nothing of the kind.” The secretary of state was not about to help make the British a decisive player in Hawaiian politics.14","['1887', '1887', 'two years later', '1890', '1887', '1890']",1887 planter strike term “ revolution ” demand weak king kalakaua sign new constitution turn de facto control white sufficient property qualification bayard help give u.s minister blank check aid white planter fully include inference landing troop necessary need 1887 land year later outbreak 1890 annexationist lose control government lead lorrin a. thurston mastermind 1887 takeover secretly prepare second “ revolution ” canadian pacific railroad british interest prominent british minister united state julian pauncefote suggest secretary state blaine 1890 nation pledge ensure hawaiian independence “ mr blaine ” pauncefote recall “ emphatic way say united state kind ” secretary state help british decisive player hawaiian politics.14,106,"[1887, 1887, 1890, 1887, 1890]",1888,5,1900,1900
493,"Then the hammer blow fell. The reciprocity provision of the 1890 McKinley Tariff not only put sugar on the free list – and ultimately through a treaty gave Cuban sugar preferential entry – but also bought off domestic sugar producers by giving them a subsidy of two cents per pound. With its sugar suddenly much less competitive in the U.S. market, the Hawaiian economy went into a tailspin. Perhaps Harrison, Blaine, and McKinley had foreseen this result; certainly they were ready with a measure declaring that the new tariff in no way affected the 1887 treaty or the lease on Pearl Harbor. The anti-American group seized the offensive in 1891 by putting in power Queen Liliuokalani, who, U.S. Minister John Stevens warned Blaine, had “extreme notions of sovereign authority.” Stevens also sent so many messages to Washington claiming that the British and Canadians were poised to strike that Harrison started to mention his fears of the threat in private correspondence. The smaller planters who were most damaged by the 1890 tariff meanwhile prepared to seize power. A U.S. navy official reported to Washington that if a revolt erupted, “it would simply be the old struggle of the Anglo Saxon race against the weaker element.” Just in case he had miscalculated, however, U.S. forces remained close by.15","['1890', '–', '1887', '1891', '1890']",hammer blow fall reciprocity provision 1890 mckinley tariff sugar free list – ultimately treaty give cuban sugar preferential entry – buy domestic sugar producer give subsidy cent pound sugar suddenly competitive u.s market hawaiian economy go tailspin harrison blaine mckinley foresee result certainly ready measure declare new tariff way affect 1887 treaty lease pearl harbor anti group seize offensive 1891 put power queen liliuokalani u.s minister john stevens warn blaine “ extreme notion sovereign authority ” stevens send message washington claim british canadians poise strike harrison start mention fear threat private correspondence small planter damage 1890 tariff prepared seize power u.s navy official report washington revolt erupt “ simply old struggle anglo saxon race weak element ” case miscalculate u.s force remain close by.15,124,"[1890, 1887, 1891, 1890]",1890,4,1900,1900

The white planters and the queen maneuvered for power, with the queen gaining the upper hand until January 1893, when she issued a constitution giving herself greatly enlarged power. She overreached. When she tried to pull back her constitutional claims, it was too late. The annexationists, with encouragement from Blaine, prepared to move. American sailors landed on January 16, 1893, to protect American property. The annexationists seized power without significant opposition. In his last days as president, Harrison sent a treaty of annexation to the Senate. A national debate erupted. The Review of Reviews argued that Hawaii was essential to Americans because of “its central position in the commerce of the Pacific Ocean” and linked the islands directly to the importance of the China market. Opponents, however, argued in the words of the independent Boston Herald, “In a trade way we could not gain by annexation of anything we do not now possess, while politically the union would bring with it new problems of difference in race and conditions to add to those which we now have.”","['1890', 'January 1893', 'January 16, 1893', 'his last days']",1890 tariff trigger political war hawaii white planter queen maneuver power queen gain upper hand january 1893 issue constitution give greatly enlarged power overreach try pull constitutional claim late annexationist encouragement blaine prepare sailor land january 16 1893 protect property annexationist seize power significant opposition day president harrison send treaty annexation senate national debate erupt review review argue hawaii essential american “ central position commerce pacific ocean ” link island directly importance china market opponent argue word independent boston herald “ trade way gain annexation possess politically union bring new problem difference race condition add,95,"[1890, 1893, 1893]",1892,3,1900,1900

Gresham, like the Boston Herald, believed the United States possessed the economic benefits and did not need the political responsibilities.16 Four more years of economic disorder followed in the United States before McKinley returned, this time as president, to annex Hawaii and complete the process that his 1890 tariff bill had accelerated.","['more years', '1890']",new democratic party president grover cleveland secretary state walter quintin gresham agree opposition cleveland withdraw annexation treaty gresham especially fear consequence colonial policy stretch constitution far water take pain inform foreign power annexation hawaii remain limit gresham like boston herald believe united state possess economic benefit need political responsibilities.16 year economic disorder follow united state mckinley return time president annex hawaii complete process 1890 tariff bill accelerate,67,[1890],1890,1,1900,1900
496,"In the post-1865 era, U.S. foreign policy was consistently shaped by choosing opportunity, both secular and religious, over stability. The series of Hawaiian upheavals after the 1870s was one example. Nowhere, however, was this choice more obvious, and the consequences more enormous, than in Asia. Traders and diplomats, propelled by the economic crises after 1873, helped push an already fragile Asian balance of power into a series of wars. Missionaries, moved by threats of science and secularism that confronted their faith at home, determined to prove the worth of themselves and their religious beliefs by proselytizing in what they considered to be the world’s richest market for evangelicalism; they too thus contributed to the destabilization of an already tottering Korea and Manchu dynasty.","['post-1865', 'the 1870s', '1873']",post-1865 era u.s foreign policy consistently shape choose opportunity secular religious stability series hawaiian upheaval 1870s example choice obvious consequence enormous asia trader diplomat propel economic crisis 1873 help push fragile asian balance power series war missionary move threat science secularism confront faith home determine prove worth religious belief proselytize consider world ’s rich market evangelicalism contribute destabilization totter korea manchu dynasty,62,"[1865, 1870, 1873]",1869,3,1875,1900
497,"Seward had placed U.S. policy in Asia on two principles: the use of force and cooperation with other powers. In policy toward China, those principles remained in place for most of the following three-quarters of a century. In regard to Japan, however, they were broken within a decade. In the 1870s, in a historic turn that revealed much about the future of Washington’s approach to the Far East, U.S. officials departed from their European colleagues and unilaterally helped Japan, which beginning in 1868 had transformed its government in a spectacularly successful commitment to modernize the country along Western industrial lines. The U.S. minister to Japan in the mid-1870s, Judge John A. Bingharn, took the initiative by showing sympathy to Japanese demands for tariff autonomy, and by understanding that U.S.-Japanese cooperation could undercut the powerful British position in the Japanese market. Bingharn’s view of a rising Japan was reinforced in 1876 when Tokyo signed a pact directly with Korea. The treaty for the first time split Korea apart from its tributary relationship with China and signaled that a dramatic rearrangement of power relationships was beginning in the region, with Japan doing much of the rearranging. In an 1878 treaty, the United States, to the displeasure of Europeans, granted Tokyo large measures of tariff autonomy. The British were able to kill this concession, but the United States (again over British objections) had taken an interest in removing extraterritorial rights in the 1880s. Washington signaled that it was betting on Japan’s future, rather than China’s or Korea’s, in Asia.17","['three-quarters of a century', 'a decade', 'the 1870s', '1868', 'the mid-1870s', '1876', '1878', 'the 1880s']",seward place u.s policy asia principle use force cooperation power policy china principle remain place following quarter century regard japan break decade 1870s historic turn reveal future washington ’s approach far east u.s official depart european colleague unilaterally help japan begin 1868 transform government spectacularly successful commitment modernize country western industrial line u.s minister japan mid-1870 judge john a. bingharn take initiative show sympathy japanese demand tariff autonomy understand u.s .- japanese cooperation undercut powerful british position japanese market bingharn ’s view rise japan reinforce 1876 tokyo sign pact directly korea treaty time split korea apart tributary relationship china signal dramatic rearrangement power relationship begin region japan rearranging 1878 treaty united state displeasure europeans grant tokyo large measure tariff autonomy british able kill concession united state british objection take interest remove extraterritorial right 1880s washington signal bet japan ’s future china ’s korea ’s asia.17,145,"[1870, 1868, 1870, 1876, 1878, 1880]",1874,6,1875,1900
498," The United States then followed through by copying the Japanese example and opening Korea to Western interests. Some Americans, especially those from California, had been calling for access to Korea in the 1870s. Japan’s 1876 treaty, recognizing Korean separateness from China, provided leverage. Secretary of State James G. Blaine and Rear Admiral Robert Shufeldt provided the initiative. Blaine’s interest in Asia was distinctly secondary to his involvement with Latin American affairs, but in November 1881 he instructed Shufeldt to make a treaty with Korea because its ports, “so near to Japan and China,” should “be opened to our trade and to the convenience of… vessels of our navy.” Shufeldt needed no urging. He had extensively worked with the Chinese to improve their navy, and he understood the opportunity that was, in his view, nothing less than civilizing Asia. As he told a Stamford, Connecticut, audience:","['the 1870s', '1876', 'November 1881']",united state follow copy japanese example open korea western interest american especially california call access korea 1870s japan ’s 1876 treaty recognize korean separateness china provide leverage secretary state james g. blaine rear admiral robert shufeldt provide initiative blaine ’s interest asia distinctly secondary involvement latin affair november 1881 instruct shufeldt treaty korea port “ near japan china ” “ open trade convenience … vessel navy ” shufeldt need urging extensively work chinese improve navy understand opportunity view civilize asia tell stamford connecticut audience,84,"[1870, 1876, 1881]",1876,3,1900,1900
499,"Shufeldt’s 1882 treaty with Korea gave Americans the right to live in port cities, a role in setting tariff rates, the privilege of extraterritoriality protection, and the power to end the opium trade. The pact further weakened the power of the Chinese empire, which had considered Korea a tributary state. Blaine, Bayard, and other U.S. officials believed the United States could profit from this weakness, and by the late 1880s Bayard was telling the pivotal U.S. diplomat in Korea, Horace Allen, where to go for loans in California if New York bankers could not help. Allen needed little encouragement. A devout Presbyterian, Allen became a Protestant missionary who willingly entered a country that had been violently anti-Christian. (No sooner had he gotten into Korea than he tried to exclude Roman Catholics.) By the mid-1880s, Allen cared less about saving souls than making money for Americans, including himself, and collecting valuable Korean art. He worked closely with the progressive, pro-Japanese party that wanted to break Korea cleanly from China and modernize it, in part through concessions to Allen and his friends. As early as 1884 such changes had exploded in a bloody, anti-Japanese war in Korea. But Allen scarcely missed a beat. By 1889–90, he worked with Blaine and Vice-President Levi P. Morton’s Wall Street firm of Morton, Bliss to obtain a range of Korean property, including rights to perhaps the richest gold mines in Asia. Allen was weakening China (and Korea) and playing into Japan’s hands. The Japanese were not yet ready for war during the 1884 outbreak. A decade later they were, and Asia’s balance of power was then transformed.19","['1882', 'the late 1880s', 'the mid-1880s', '1884', '1884', 'A decade later']",shufeldt ’s 1882 treaty korea give american right live port city role set tariff rate privilege extraterritoriality protection power end opium trade pact weaken power chinese empire consider korea tributary state blaine bayard u.s official believe united state profit weakness late 1880 bayard tell pivotal u.s diplomat korea horace allen loan california new york banker help allen need little encouragement devout presbyterian allen protestant missionary willingly enter country violently anti christian sooner get korea try exclude roman catholic mid-1880 allen care save soul make money american include collect valuable korean art work closely progressive pro japanese party want break korea cleanly china modernize concession allen friend early 1884 change explode bloody anti japanese war korea allen scarcely miss beat 1889–90 work blaine vice president levi p. morton ’s wall street firm morton bliss obtain range korean property include right rich gold mine asia allen weaken china korea play japan ’s hand japanese ready war 1884 outbreak decade later asia ’s balance power transformed.19,163,"[1882, 1880, 1880, 1884, 1884]",1882,5,1900,1900
500,"Even as the United States helped separate Korea from China, and in 1882 broke an 1880 pact by prohibiting Chinese laborers from entering the United States, Americans worked to develop their economic and political ties with China. In the 1868 Seward-Burlingame Treaty, Washington had pledged to follow a noninterventionist policy in China’s internal development. Through the 1880s, U.S. officials said they wanted to protect the status quo; although they wanted no Chinese territory, neither did they want other powers to obtain any. But there were the usual contradictions. Shufeldt’s mission to Korea had already broken up the status quo, and as U.S. minister to China John Russell Young declared in the 1880s, his first duty was to protect U.S. claims in China.20","['1882', '1880', '1868', 'the 1880s', 'the 1880s']",united state help separate korea china 1882 break 1880 pact prohibit chinese laborer enter united state american work develop economic political tie china 1868 seward burlingame treaty washington pledge follow noninterventionist policy china ’s internal development 1880 u.s official say want protect status quo want chinese territory want power obtain usual contradiction shufeldt ’s mission korea break status quo u.s minister china john russell young declare 1880s duty protect u.s claim china.20,72,"[1882, 1880, 1868, 1880, 1880]",1878,5,1900,1900
501,"The U.S. claims and involvement picked up after 1885, when Charles Denby became the U.S. minister. A railroad entrepreneur, Denby was close to other railway builders, especially James Harrison Wilson of Secretary of State Bayard’s hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. Wilson had visions of linking China and Korea into one huge market for U.S. goods. Bayard reassured a New York businessman that Denby understood he was to help U.S. firms and that the ambitious Wilson also was ready “to rattle all the china in the National Cupboard.” Such reassurances were welcome, especially to Southern textile interests and to journals of the iron and steel industry, which urged immediate and full entry into the race for the China market. Working closely with Li Hung-chang, who led the drive for Chinese development in the 1870s and 1880s, a Philadelphia syndicate tried to set up a bank to finance railroad construction, but internal Chinese politics killed the project.21","['1885', 'the 1870s and 1880s']",u.s claim involvement pick 1885 charles denby u.s minister railroad entrepreneur denby close railway builder especially jame harrison wilson secretary state bayard ’s hometown wilmington delaware wilson vision link china korea huge market u.s good bayard reassure new york businessman denby understand help u.s firm ambitious wilson ready “ rattle china national cupboard ” reassurance welcome especially southern textile interest journal iron steel industry urge immediate entry race china market work closely li hung chang lead drive chinese development 1870s 1880 philadelphia syndicate try set bank finance railroad construction internal chinese politic kill project.21,94,[1885],1885,1,1900,1900
502,"The enthusiasm generated for the China market by the business community was at least matched by the go-for-broke determination of American missionaries. The 1880s to 1920s era marked the golden age of missionary enterprise, most notably in the Near East, where missionaries were deeply involved in Turkey and North Africa, and in the Far East. At a Protestant meeting in China during 1890, the call went out for a thousand more evangelists to enter in the next five years; more than eleven hundred appeared, with Americans predominating, despite the upheaval and dangers of the 1894 Sino-Japanese War.","['The 1880s to 1920s era', '1890', 'the next five years', '1894']",enthusiasm generate china market business community match broke determination missionary 1880s 1920s era mark golden age missionary enterprise notably near east missionary deeply involved turkey north africa far east protestant meeting china 1890 go thousand evangelist enter year appear american predominate despite upheaval danger 1894 sino japanese war,48,"[1890, 1894]",1892,2,1900,1900
503,"The causes of this invasion were many. Back home, churches were challenged by the new Darwinian science, and the church’s social status came under siege by the secular demands (and profits) of the industrial transformation. Fundamentalist leaders, such as the charismatic Dwight L. Moody, met Darwinism with an emphatic reiteration of the old-time religion and the command that believers were to show their worth by bringing into the fold more believers. Expansion was as much a requirement for religion as it was for Carnegie’s steel mills; or as one missionary phrased it, “Christianity is a religion that will not keep.” Others dealt with Darwinism by trying to coopt its social Darwinian variant. Perhaps the leader here was Josiah Strong, a Congregationalist minister whose book Our Country sold 175,000 copies in the 1880s and was translated into Asian and European languages. His lectures were nearly as much in demand as his books. Strong’s message was a love song to Anglo-Saxon expansionism. It outlined the usual Darwinian stages to justify the conclusion that historically empire had moved west from Persia and Greece to reach its peak in “our mighty West, there to remain, for there is no further West; beyond is the Orient.” Strong followed the logic of his argument and, by 1902, headed an international gospel movement. By 1913 he had begun writing four volumes entitled Our World. Two decades earlier, another Congregationalist minister had exhibited the influences that Strong exemplified with an article entitled, “The Anglo-Saxon and the World’s Redemption.”22","['the 1880s', '1902', '1913', 'Two decades earlier']","cause invasion home church challenge new darwinian science church ’s social status come siege secular demand profit industrial transformation fundamentalist leader charismatic dwight l. moody meet darwinism emphatic reiteration old time religion command believer worth bring fold believer expansion requirement religion carnegie ’s steel mill missionary phrase “ christianity religion ” deal darwinism try coopt social darwinian variant leader josiah strong congregationalist minister book country sell 175,000 copy 1880 translate asian european language lecture nearly demand book strong ’s message love song anglo saxon expansionism outline usual darwinian stage justify conclusion historically empire move west persia greece reach peak “ mighty west remain west orient ” strong follow logic argument 1902 head international gospel movement 1913 begin write volume entitle world decade earlier congregationalist minister exhibit influence strong exemplify article entitle “ anglo saxon world ’s redemption.”22",137,"[1880, 1902, 1913]",1898,3,1900,1900
504,"Such contagious enthusiasm easily found its way into women’s clubs, which proliferated after 1870 and became highly important sponsors of missions both at home and abroad. The enthusiasm especially struck colleges. The Student Volunteers for Foreign Missions became part of the booming YMCA and YWCA movements in the post-1887 years, and it soon had chapters on nearly every American college campus. By 1914 the Student Volunteers had nearly six thousand missionaries stationed abroad. Nowhere was passion higher than at Yale, which produced three of the loudest voices for redeeming China: Horace Pitkin (who was beheaded by the Chinese during the Boxer Rebellion), Sherwood Eddy, and Henry Luce (father of the founder of Time, Fortune, and Life magazines). All three men practiced in China the overly ambitious motto of the Student Volunteers: “The Evangelization of the World in this Generation.” Prohibited in China before the 1850s and encountering bitter opposition afterward from Chinese authorities, Christian missionaries by 1898 had infiltrated every Chinese province plus Manchuria. They also followed Horace Allen’s lead in Korea and worked to separate that country so that they would not have to put up with Chinese anti-Christianity.23","['1870', 'the post-1887 years', '1914', 'the 1850s', '1898']",contagious enthusiasm easily find way woman ’s club proliferate 1870 highly important sponsor mission home abroad enthusiasm especially strike college student volunteer foreign mission booming ymca ywca movement post-1887 year soon chapter nearly college campus 1914 student volunteer nearly thousand missionary station abroad passion high yale produce loud voice redeem china horace pitkin behead chinese boxer rebellion sherwood eddy henry luce father founder time fortune life magazine man practice china overly ambitious motto student volunteer “ evangelization world generation ” prohibit china 1850 encounter bitter opposition afterward chinese authority christian missionary 1898 infiltrate chinese province plus manchuria follow horace allen ’s lead korea work separate country chinese anti christianity.23,109,"[1870, 1887, 1914, 1850, 1898]",1884,5,1900,1900
505," As their activities in Korea illustrate, the missionaries were not political amateurs. They well understood the growing contradiction between U.S. public support for Chinese territorial integrity and autonomy, on the one hand, and, on the other, U.S. private and public demands for concessions and the full rights and protection of American citizens. “The indications of Providence all point westward,” one missionary voice argued in 1890, and “China is open to the Gospel now” although “it may not be so when she becomes strong enough to dictate the terms of her treaties…. It is the full hour of opportunity.” The matter was of the utmost urgency. As a Congregationalist leader argued, missionaries “are laying the foundations of empires, and we are shaping the future of great populations and mighty states.” An all important part of that future was built around American economic expansion. As the Congregationalist phrased it, “Commerce follows the missionary.”24 No missionary expressed this idea more plainly than Isaac Taylor Headland, who had begun his service in 1893. In a 1912 memoir he recalled:","['1890', '1893', '1912']",activity korea illustrate missionary political amateur understand grow contradiction u.s public support chinese territorial integrity autonomy hand u.s private public demand concession right protection citizen “ indication providence point westward ” missionary voice argue 1890 “ china open gospel “ strong dictate term treaty … hour opportunity ” matter utmost urgency congregationalist leader argue missionary “ lay foundation empire shape future great population mighty state ” important future build economic expansion congregationalist phrase “ commerce follow missionary.”24 missionary express idea plainly isaac taylor headland begin service 1893 1912 memoir recall,90,"[1890, 1893, 1912]",1898,3,1900,1900
506,"Not everyone agreed. E. L. Godkin, the editor of the Nation, noted that when a missionary was expelled from a country, “he gives the impression of a furious animal robbed of his prey.” Godkin, doubtless noting the dispatch of U.S. warships to China and the Near East in 1893–4 to protect the missions and other American interests from war, sarcastically added that the missionary expected the U.S. military to “stand by with fixed bayonets while he preaches peace on earth good will to men.” Godkin’s words were not hyperbole. The commander of a U.S. gunboat on the Yangtse River reported home in 1891 that “the Missionary cause has made most extraordinary progress…. Their number is constantly increasing and there seems to be no limit to the money that is behind them.” He noted, however, that the reason the region was quiet was “entirely … the presence of gunboats.”26","['1893–4', '1891']",agree e. l. godkin editor nation note missionary expel country “ give impression furious animal rob prey ” godkin doubtless note dispatch u.s warship china near east 1893–4 protect mission interest war sarcastically add missionary expect u.s military “ stand fix bayonet preach peace earth good man ” godkin ’s word hyperbole commander u.s gunboat yangtse river report home 1891 “ missionary because extraordinary progress … number constantly increase limit money note reason region quiet “ entirely … presence gunboats.”26,80,"[1893, 1891]",1892,2,1900,1900
507,"“We, more than any other Power, are to have the Pacific trade – the trade with China and Japan,” a New York business newspaper announced in 1894. But the Americans were also guaranteeing the blessings of the West with gunboats and proclaiming that an Open Door for China was so important that not even the Chinese could close it. As Korea moved out of control, as China became more difficult to govern, as the great powers began to circle, and as Japan poised to strike, all the assumptions of U.S. policy came into question. Indeed, as historian John K. Fairbank has argued, when Chinese authority crumbled, the privileged and protected missionaries became highly influential with certain Chinese audiences, and “through this interaction, the Protestant missions began to make their contribution to the Chinese revolutionary process.”27","['–', '1894']",“ power pacific trade – trade china japan ” new york business newspaper announce 1894 american guarantee blessing west gunboat proclaim open door china important chinese close korea move control china difficult govern great power begin circle japan poise strike assumption u.s policy come question historian john k. fairbank argue chinese authority crumble privileged protect missionary highly influential certain chinese audience “ interaction protestant mission begin contribution chinese revolutionary process.”27,70,[1894],1894,1,1900,1900
508,"Washington would not back off. Opportunities for missionaries and concessions in the greatest of all potential markets took precedence over order and consequently over Chinese self-rule, which became more difficult to realize as the country became more destabilized. Nor did the Japanese offer as much hope as before. The commander of the U.S. Asiatic squadron reported to Washington in 1893 that “Japan is likely to add to the complications at Hawaii” and “was anxious to enlarge her possessions” in Asia. He quoted a Japanese naval officer as saying, “We aim to make Japan the England of the Pacific.” The U.S. commander also quoted a former Japanese minister of foreign affairs as declaring that building an isthmian canal would be most welcome because it would stimulate “Japanese emigration to Central America [and] even to Mexico.”28",['1893'],washington opportunity missionary concession great potential market take precedence order consequently chinese self rule difficult realize country destabilized japanese offer hope commander u.s asiatic squadron report washington 1893 “ japan likely add complication hawaii ” “ anxious enlarge possession ” asia quote japanese naval officer say “ aim japan england pacific ” u.s commander quote japanese minister foreign affair declare build isthmian canal welcome stimulate “ japanese emigration central america mexico.”28,71,[1893],1893,1,1900,1900

510,"The U.S. drive to become the world’s most powerful nation climaxed successfully in the generation that came to power during and immediately after the Spanish-American War of 1898. The success had been long in forming, but the catalyst was the 1873–97 depression and especially the economic downturn of 1893–7, which transformed a long era of deflation into a full-blown economic crisis. The post-1898 American empire was a product of the pre-1897 chaos at home. As we have seen, the crisis was triggered by the technological and managerial advances of the Second Industrial Revolution, advances that were exemplified by Carnegie’s policy of “running hard” to compete for, and indeed dominate, market share. By the 1890s the Second Industrial Revolution, by all odds the most important event in American history between 1865 and 1914, had already begun spinning off a new, extracontinental foreign policy whose voices were Seward’s and Blaine’s especially. Culture (as manifested in the missionary movement), ideas (as seen in social Darwinism), and politics (as exemplified by an evolving Republican party and its fresh-found interest in reciprocity), as well as foreign policy, had to adapt to the industrial changes.","['a long era', 'the 1890s', 'between 1865 and 1914']",u.s drive world ’s powerful nation climax successfully generation come power immediately spanish war 1898 success long form catalyst 1873–97 depression especially economic downturn 1893–7 transform long era deflation blow economic crisis post-1898 empire product pre-1897 chaos home see crisis trigger technological managerial advance second industrial revolution advance exemplify carnegie ’s policy “ run hard ” compete dominate market share 1890s second industrial revolution odd important event history 1865 1914 begin spin new extracontinental foreign policy voice seward ’s blaine ’ especially culture manifest missionary movement idea see social darwinism politic exemplify evolve republican party fresh find interest reciprocity foreign policy adapt industrial change,104,[1890],1890,1,1900,1900
511,"By 1893 the social trauma was becoming pronounced. Even the 1877 general strike and the 1886 Haymarket Riot paled in comparison. The percentage of unemployed in the total labor force of the manufacturing and transportation sectors has been estimated at about 4 percent in 1892, doubling to 9.6 percent in a year, and nearly doubling again to 16.7 percent in 1894. It remained between nearly 12 percent and 14 percent through 1898 and then, finally, dropped to 7.7 percent in 1899.1 Those were only stark figures. More real were the general strike called by 160,000 miners in the soft-coal fields; a strike that paralyzed the Great Northern Railway; the massive march of the unemployed eastward toward Washington in the Coxey and Hogan “armies”; the near capture of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) by its socialist wing; the Pullman strike in Chicago, which President Grover Cleveland put down with federal troops, and which one historian called “almost a reign of terror”; and the claim by the Nation that California was “in the hands of mobs at Oakland, Sacramento, and Los Angeles, and when the militia are called out to enforce the law, they side with the rioters and throw down their arms.” All that (and more) occurred only in 1894. If any intelligent observer had doubts about the class warfare inherent in these crises, such doubts were removed in 1895 when a highly conservative Supreme Court struck down income tax legislation, and when the Cleveland administration had to turn to J. P. Morgan to save the nearly bankrupt U.S. Treasury by floating bonds to wealthy American and British investors.

He told a Brown University audience in 1894 that the causes were not “temporary, accidental, superficial, and isolated” but “lie deeper [and] are of no recent origin.” Olney continued, “All over the civilized world the working man is in a state of unrest.” Such laborers believed they were “preparing a revolution which shall do for the emancipation of labor what Luther and the Reformation did for freedom of conscience, and what [1776] did for political liberty.” In his memoirs, AFL leader Samuel Gompers phrased the problem more simply: “The period of depression was often called a period of so-called overproduction, which was really a period of under-consumption for the people I knew, a period of hard times.”3","['1894', '1776']",cleveland ’s attorney general later u.s secretary state richard olney place crisis large global crisis capitalism tell brown university audience 1894 cause “ temporary accidental superficial isolate ” “ lie deeper recent origin ” olney continue “ civilized world work man state unrest laborer believe “ prepare revolution shall emancipation labor luther reformation freedom conscience 1776 political liberty ” memoir afl leader samuel gomper phrase problem simply “ period depression call period call overproduction period consumption people know period hard times.”3,81,"[1894, 1776]",1835,2,1850,1850
513,"No government official agonized over the deeper historical meaning of these “hard times” more than Cleveland’s first secretary of state, Walter Quintin Gresham, who served from March 1893 until his sudden death two years later. Gresham had been the judge who handled the 1877 general strike. Resembling Olney (and many others), Gresham defined the problem not as temporary or limited to the United States but as a long-term crisis of global capitalism. Its effects, and the social and political ills that accumulated in the 1880s, finally drove Gresham to leave the Republican party and join the Democrats. He left even after having served as President Chester Arthur’s postmaster general and secretary of the treasury during 1882 and 1884. After a brief flirtation with the Populists, he tied the crisis to the Second Industrial Revolution. In 1892, Gresham wrote that the “labor question” emerged from “new conditions utterly unlike anything in the past. Labor-saving machinery has given capital an advantage that it never possessed before. What is an equitable division of the joint product of capital and labor, and who is to decide the question” – settling that issue would produce “serious consequences.” Gresham and British Ambassador Julian Pauncefote sometimes met to discuss “the greatest question of the age … that of capital and labor,” as Mrs. Matilda Gresham recalled their definition of the problem.","['March 1893', 'two years later', '1877', 'the 1880s', '1882 and 1884', '1892']",government official agonize deep historical meaning “ hard time ” cleveland ’s secretary state walter quintin gresham serve march 1893 sudden death year later gresham judge handle 1877 general strike resemble olney gresham define problem temporary limit united state long term crisis global capitalism effect social political ill accumulate 1880 finally drive gresham leave republican party join democrat leave have serve president chester arthur ’s postmaster general secretary treasury 1882 1884 brief flirtation populist tie crisis second industrial revolution 1892 gresham write “ labor question ” emerge “ new condition utterly unlike past labor save machinery give capital advantage possess equitable division joint product capital labor decide question ” – settle issue produce “ consequence ” gresham british ambassador julian pauncefote meet discuss “ great question age … capital labor ” mrs matilda gresham recall definition problem,137,"[1893, 1877, 1880, 1892]",1886,4,1900,1900

[How] to keep the people of the various countries employed, prosperous, and happy at home, were the great questions to be met,” she recorded after his death. In 1893, Secretary of State Gresham told a U.S. consul that the repeal of the 1890 Sherman Silver Purchase Act would be useful in that it might help restore faith in American money, but the economic problems’ causes lay far deeper. Gresham had little belief in American exceptionalism. “The danger that menaces society in this country is like the menace in Europe…. Honest laboring men will not quietly see their families starve,” he wrote a friend on May 2, 1894. Freer raw materials could, however, help in the United States because “this would lower the cost of the manufacturing article and enable our people to compete in foreign markets with Great Britain.” Five days later, in a “personal and confidential” letter to a close friend, Gresham warned, “The present condition of things was brought about largely by our high tariff legislation….

He told the distinguished international lawyer John Bassett Moore that the “outlook” now seemed to “portend revolution.” Gresham passed on the evaluation of a close friend and former senator: “There probably would be a revolution in the U.S., with a great leader emerging and then there would be a quest for empire.”4","['1893', '1890', 'May 2, 1894', 'Five days later', 'nine days']",“ labor save machine satisfy patent judge productive power world increase increase capacity world consume people country employ prosperous happy home great question meet ” record death 1893 secretary state gresham tell u.s consul repeal 1890 sherman silver purchase act useful help restore faith money economic problems’ cause lie far deep gresham little belief exceptionalism “ danger menace society country like menace europe … honest laboring man quietly family starve ” write friend 2 1894 free raw material help united state “ lower cost manufacturing article enable people compete foreign market great britain ” day later “ personal confidential ” letter close friend gresham warn “ present condition thing bring largely high tariff legislation … transpire pennsylvania ohio indiana illinois region west fairly view symptom revolution add non sequitur “ trouble pass like regard dark hour dawn ” day wonder dawn appear tell distinguished international lawyer john bassett moore “ outlook ” “ portend revolution ” gresham pass evaluation close friend senator “ probably revolution u.s great leader emerge quest empire.”4,171,"[1893, 1890, 1894]",1892,3,1900,1900
515,"The industrial changes and their cataclysmic consequences forced the most fundamental questioning of the political order that had occurred since 1787. (Even in 1861–5 only the South actually questioned that order.) The results, however, were broad rather than deep. The constitutional system and the property relationships changed little in the post-1893 generation. Other parts of the society did change, however. Americans seemed to try to escape the crises by being constantly in motion or becoming attracted to those who were. Professional baseball, heavyweight boxing, basketball (invented in 1891), and bicycle riding became preoccupations of the 1890s. At the renewal of the Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, the peripatetic Americans won nine of fourteen gold medals and then took fourteen of twenty in Paris four years later. Frederick Jackson Turner’s famous 1893 essay, “The Significance of the Frontier in American History,” noted the importance of the frontier in forming the American character and its political system over four hundred years of history. He dramatically left open at the end of his paper how that character and system were endangered now that the 1890 census officially declared the frontier closed. Frank Lloyd Wright employed the concept of open space in designing a new architecture; Mark Twain’s, Brooks Adams’s, Hamlin Garland’s, and William Dean Howells’s writings (and the rediscovery of Walt Whitman’s after his death in 1892) explored the meaning of frontier space and, more particularly, the implications of its closing.6","['1787', '1891', 'the 1890s', '1896', 'four years later', '1893', 'four hundred years', '1890', '1892']",industrial change cataclysmic consequence force fundamental questioning political order occur 1787 1861–5 south actually question order result broad deep constitutional system property relationship change little post-1893 generation part society change american try escape crisis constantly motion attract professional baseball heavyweight boxing basketball invent 1891 bicycle riding preoccupation 1890s renewal olympic game athen 1896 peripatetic american win fourteen gold medal take fourteen paris year later frederick jackson turner ’s famous 1893 essay “ significance frontier history ” note importance frontier form character political system year history dramatically leave open end paper character system endanger 1890 census officially declare frontier close frank lloyd wright employ concept open space design new architecture mark twain ’s brooks adams ’s hamlin garland ’s william dean howells ’s writing rediscovery walt whitman ’ death 1892 explore meaning frontier space particularly implication closing.6,136,"[1787, 1891, 1890, 1896, 1893, 1890, 1892]",1877,7,1900,1900
516,"The Second Industrial Revolution struck at the moment when open space, especially the existence of a supposed frontier, seemed to be closing. As Twain described graphically in A Connecticut Yankee, technology had left no place to hide. President Cleveland noted the meaning of the frontier’s closing in less apocalyptic terms in his 1893 annual message. Winslow Homer similarly redirected the observer’s attention in his magnificent 1890s seascapes. These were not the soft sea scenes of the impressionists in Europe, nor were they the westward-looking paintings of the Hudson River School and later influential American artists. Homer instead turned one’s attention to the new U.S. frontier, now that the supposed old one was closing – that is, to the merciless and unpredictable ocean. If Americans sought escape from the growing political and economic crisis that now filled their closing land, Homer seemed to be warning that to try to escape through the greatest of all frontiers held equal, if not greater, dangers.7","['1893', 'annual', '1890s', '–']",second industrial revolution strike moment open space especially existence suppose frontier close twain describe graphically connecticut yankee technology leave place hide president cleveland note meaning frontier ’s closing apocalyptic term 1893 annual message winslow homer similarly redirect observer ’s attention magnificent 1890s seascape soft sea scene impressionist europe westward look painting hudson river school later influential artist homer instead turn ’s attention new u.s frontier suppose old close – merciless unpredictable ocean american seek escape grow political economic crisis fill closing land homer warn try escape great frontier hold equal great dangers.7,92,"[1893, 1890]",1892,2,1900,1900
517,"The majority of Americans, those who lived on farms, did not have to be told about the dangers of western settlement. By the 1890s farmers had been bludgeoned by falling crop prices, harsh winters, too little credit, expensive transportation, and massive foreclosures. Many debtors in both the country and the city turned to silver as a panacea. They were met head-on by creditors and Washington officials who had little sympathy for the silverites. Historians have argued that Presidents Benjamin Harrison and Grover Cleveland represented a Presbyterian type that insisted on probity, hard work, and paying off, rather than discounting, debt. Harrison blunted the attempt to coin large amounts of silver in the 1890 compromise, and Cleveland killed the compromise outright in 1893. Their morality received impressive support from their economic beliefs. Cleveland’s secretary of the treasury, John G. Carlisle, argued vigorously in his annual reports that too large an infusion of the cheaper silver coins could ruin U.S. currency by destroying its credibility in world markets. By 1892 the United States was second only to Great Britain on the list of the world’s largest international traders. “Gold is the only international money, and all trade balances are settled in gold,” Carlisle lectured. American farmers were in a poor position to argue the point. For more than a century these producers of grain, cotton, tobacco, and other staples had depended on prices set abroad.8","['the 1890s', 'winters', '1890', '1893', 'annual', '1892', 'more than a century']",majority american live farm tell danger western settlement 1890s farmer bludgeon fall crop price harsh winter little credit expensive transportation massive foreclosure debtor country city turn silver panacea meet head creditor washington official little sympathy silverite historian argue president benjamin harrison grover cleveland represent presbyterian type insist probity hard work pay discount debt harrison blunt attempt coin large amount silver 1890 compromise cleveland kill compromise outright 1893 morality receive impressive support economic belief cleveland ’s secretary treasury john g. carlisle argue vigorously annual report large infusion cheap silver coin ruin u.s currency destroy credibility world market 1892 united state second great britain list world ’s large international trader “ gold international money trade balance settle gold ” carlisle lecture farmer poor position argue point century producer grain cotton tobacco staple depend price set abroad.8,134,"[1890, 1890, 1893, 1892]",1891,4,1900,1900
518,"Leading, well-connected economists provided intellectual support for the Cleveland-Carlisle argument. Few were more prominent or better connected than David Ames Wells, a Republican whose reports as commissioner of revenue in the mid-1860s launched him as a pivotal voice of low-tariff advocates. He was joined by other leading economists, publicists such as E. L. Godkin of the Nation, and important newspaper editors including Henry Watterson of the Louisville Courier-Journal. Watterson was committed to the cause of restoring the New South’s wealth and sense of self-worth, after its defeat in the Civil War, by integrating it as a major part of an overseas U.S. commercial empire. In August 1893, as the economy seemed to be sliding toward oblivion, Wells declared that because U.S. manufacturers produced more than “the existing market demands,” and because “foreign markets have been cut off” by high U.S. protective tariffs, it was time to slash those tariffs.9 The reciprocity provision of the 1890 tariff act was a start, but insufficient. In 1894, Cleveland obtained repeal of the act and tried to replace it with the low-tariff Wilson-Gorman legislation, which allowed the import of cheaper raw materials. The 1894 measure did not go nearly as far as Wells, Cleveland, and other low-tariff disciples wanted, but the general case had been made and accepted by a majority: The future of the U.S. economy lay increasingly in foreign markets, and more cheap silver coinage would ruin rather than help the dollar compete in those markets. Consequently, the markets had to be captured by reducing tariffs, bringing in cheaper raw materials, using new technologies, and thus making U.S. goods more competitive.","['the mid-1860s', 'August 1893', '1894', '1894']",lead connect economist provide intellectual support cleveland carlisle argument prominent better connect david ames well republican report commissioner revenue mid-1860 launch pivotal voice low tariff advocate join leading economist publicist e. l. godkin nation important newspaper editor include henry watterson louisville courier journal watterson commit because restore new south ’s wealth sense self worth defeat civil war integrate major overseas u.s commercial empire august 1893 economy slide oblivion well declare u.s manufacturer produce “ exist market demand ” “ foreign market cut ” high u.s protective tariff time slash tariffs.9 reciprocity provision 1890 tariff act start insufficient 1894 cleveland obtain repeal act try replace low tariff wilson gorman legislation allow import cheap raw material 1894 measure nearly far well cleveland low tariff disciple want general case accept majority future u.s economy lie increasingly foreign market cheap silver coinage ruin help dollar compete market consequently market capture reduce tariff bring cheap raw material new technology make u.s good competitive,158,"[1860, 1893, 1894, 1894]",1885,4,1900,1900

In 1893, with the gold standard’s victory, “a capitalistic system had been adopted, and if it were to be run at all, it must be run by capital and by capitalistic methods; for nothing,” Adams fervently believed, “could surpass the nonsensity of trying to run so complex and so concentrated a machine by Southern and Western farmers in grotesque alliance with city day-laborers, as had been tried in 1800 and 1828, and had failed even under simple conditions.”10","['1893', '1800 and 1828']",henry adams ’s firsthand summary 1893–6 debate catch perfectly 1893 gold standard ’s victory “ capitalistic system adopt run run capital capitalistic method ” adam fervently believe “ surpass nonsensity try run complex concentrate machine southern western farmer grotesque alliance city day laborer try 1800 1828 fail simple conditions.”10,49,[1893],1893,1,1900,1900
520,"In Western Europe the post-1873 depression’s effects, and rising industrial competition, had driven one nation after another toward protectionist policies. In Bismarck’s Germany, moreover, the great industrial-capital hub of the European continent was being politically based (after the late-1870s agrarian crisis) on a conservative alliance between large landowners and major industrialists. The alliance’s protectionism began to be matched by its support for Bismarck’s accelerating search for formal territorial empire.11 The United States, catching up with and then outstripping even Germany in industrial production, went in the opposite direction with its tariff and agrarian policies. Instead of moving toward more protectionism, after 1890 the Americans, slowly and with much backing and filling because of the entrenched high-tariff interests, which attached themselves to lawmakers like barnacles, chipped away at those barnacles and moved toward a low-tariff policy that made food and raw material imports cheaper. As for the farmers, they were sacrificed on the altar built and sanctified by the post-1870 Industrial Revolution. Unlike those in Bismarck’s Germany, agrarians in the United States were told to “raise less corn and more hell,” in Populist Mary Elizabeth Lease’s famous proclamation. But neither she nor anyone else could tell them how they could raise less corn, sell more corn in world markets, and override the growing banker-industrialist power simultaneously.","['post-1873', '1890', 'post-1870']",western europe post-1873 depression ’s effect rise industrial competition drive nation protectionist policy bismarck ’s germany great industrial capital hub european continent politically base late-1870 agrarian crisis conservative alliance large landowner major industrialist alliance ’s protectionism begin match support bismarck ’s accelerate search formal territorial empire.11 united state catch outstrip germany industrial production go opposite direction tariff agrarian policy instead move protectionism 1890 american slowly backing fill entrenched high tariff interest attach lawmaker like barnacle chip away barnacle move low tariff policy food raw material import cheaper farmer sacrifice altar build sanctify post-1870 industrial revolution unlike bismarck ’s germany agrarian united state tell “ raise corn hell ” populist mary elizabeth lease ’s famous proclamation tell raise corn sell corn world market override grow banker industrialist power simultaneously,128,"[1873, 1890, 1870]",1878,3,1900,1900
521,"The die had been cast at least since 1879–81, an economist told the British Royal Statistical Society in 1895. In New York, Bradstreet’s devoted two full columns to this analysis by R. F. Crawford. Since the early 1880s, the opening of “fertile areas of virgin soil” in America had allowed farmers to grow more wheat for less cost. The farmers had since suffered from world-depressed prices, but much worse lay ahead. When Russia completed its Trans-Siberian Railway and opened up vast new fertile areas, its wheat would drive the U.S. crop out of world markets. Other observers noted that India and Argentina were also becoming large grain exporters. By 1894–5 a consensus was forming among economic analysts: Cheap U.S. farm staples appeared to be inevitable, so the best should be made of it and the staples should remain cheap so that they could help lower labor and manufacturing costs at home, thus making U.S. industrial goods the world’s most competitive, as well as the best. The trade figures seemed to indicate that sacrificing farmers was already working. “One of the features … for the fiscal year 1895 which should attract attention,” the Journal of Commerce noted in September 1895, “is the large proportion of manufactured articles.” After a three-century reign, farm products were giving way to industrial goods as the most important U.S. exports.12","['1879–81', '1895', 'the early 1880s', 'the fiscal year 1895', 'September 1895', 'three-century']",die cast 1879–81 economist tell british royal statistical society 1895 new york bradstreet ’ devoted column analysis r. f. crawford early 1880 opening “ fertile area virgin soil ” america allow farmer grow wheat cost farmer suffer world depress price bad lie ahead russia complete trans siberian railway open vast new fertile area wheat drive u.s crop world market observer note india argentina large grain exporter 1894–5 consensus form economic analyst cheap u.s farm staple appear inevitable good staple remain cheap help lower labor manufacturing cost home make u.s industrial good world ’s competitive good trade figure indicate sacrifice farmer work “ feature … fiscal year 1895 attract attention ” journal commerce note september 1895 large proportion manufacture article ” century reign farm product give way industrial good important u.s exports.12,131,"[1879, 1895, 1880, 1895, 1895]",1889,5,1900,1900
522,"The argument had been completed by Cleveland in his 1893 annual message when he declared that laborers’ true interests were not to seek help in the “narrow market” produced by high tariffs, but by low tariffs that gave them cheaper raw materials and ever greater markets that would keep them fully employed.14 Gresham had drawn the foreign policy implications: Hawaii was neither needed nor wanted as a formal colony. Not only did such a formal, annexationist, imperial policy involving islands thousands of miles away threaten the Constitution. But also America’s future was to be in the open marketplace and not among those European imperialists who sought refuge from the rigors of the Second Industrial Revolution by seeking out closed, formal colonial empires. It all fit together once the farmers were in their proper place, industry was “running hard,” and the tariff no longer separated efficient Americans from the world’s markets.","['1893', 'annual', 'laborers’']",argument complete cleveland 1893 annual message declare laborers’ true interest seek help “ narrow market ” produce high tariff low tariff give cheap raw material great market fully employed.14 gresham draw foreign policy implication hawaii need want formal colony formal annexationist imperial policy involve island thousand mile away threaten constitution america ’s future open marketplace european imperialist seek refuge rigor second industrial revolution seek closed formal colonial empire fit farmer proper place industry “ run hard ” tariff longer separate efficient american world ’s market,85,[1893],1893,1,1900,1900
523,"The historic meanings of these beliefs became apparent as the 1890s progressed. Under strong pressure from business leaders who demanded a reform of the consular service for “extending our commerce and trade with foreign countries,” Secretary of State Richard Olney worked closely with Cleveland to toughen the examinations for those agents. The U.S. diplomatic service was finally being prepared to enter the twentieth century. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), born in 1895, pushed for this reform, as well as demanded that the government build a great merchant fleet, an isthmian canal, and strong ties with Latin American markets. Such demands put the NAM, and many other Americans, at cross-purposes with the British. An NAM founder made the point and several other points: The British “come over here every day and trade us a second-class duke or a third-class earl for a first-class American girl, and get several million dollars to boot. And the very next day the entire outfit goes back to Liverpool on a British vessel. We didn’t even get the freight back to Liverpool on the earl, the girl, or the money.”15","['the 1890s', 'the twentieth century', '1895', 'every day', 'the very next day']",historic meaning belief apparent 1890s progress strong pressure business leader demand reform consular service “ extend commerce trade foreign country ” secretary state richard olney work closely cleveland toughen examination agent u.s diplomatic service finally prepared enter twentieth century national association manufacturer nam bear 1895 push reform demand government build great merchant fleet isthmian canal strong tie latin market demand nam american cross purpose british nam founder point point british “ come day trade second class duke class earl class girl million dollar boot day entire outfit go liverpool british vessel not freight liverpool earl girl money.”15,97,"[1890, 1895]",1892,2,1900,1900
524,"Americans, however, were getting their revenge. During the 1890s, not only did foreign investment in the United States begin to be replaced by American, but also U.S. money competed for the first time with British and European investors abroad. A turn came with the collapse of London’s Baring Brothers in 1890; the firm had funneled much development capital into the United States throughout the nineteenth century. The 1890s depression in Europe caused other overseas investors to pull back or to turn to quick riches in Australian mines or Argentine staples. But with their industries running hard, and U.S. trade balance increasingly favorable, Americans were becoming capital rich. Their overseas investments jumped by an estimated $250 million during the depressed 1890s. Joseph C. Hendrix, then NAM president, succinctly marked the turn in 1898: “We have the Anglo-Saxon thirst for wide markets growing upon us. We have long been the granary of the world, we now aspire to be its workshop, then we want to be its clearing house.”16","['the 1890s', '1890', 'the nineteenth century', '1890s', 'the depressed 1890s', '1898']",american get revenge 1890s foreign investment united state begin replace u.s money compete time british european investor abroad turn come collapse london ’s bar brother 1890 firm funnel development capital united state nineteenth century 1890s depression europe cause overseas investor pull turn quick rich australian mine argentine staple industry run hard u.s trade balance increasingly favorable american capital rich overseas investment jump estimate 250 million depressed 1890s joseph c. hendrix nam president succinctly mark turn 1898 “ anglo saxon thirst wide market grow long granary world aspire workshop want clearing house.”16,91,"[1890, 1890, 1890, 1890, 1898]",1892,5,1900,1900

The industrial exhibitions were breathtaking, not least the demonstration of the new dynamo machine that indeed rocked Henry Adams, because it seemed to defy the laws of both physics and history on which he had based his nineteenth-century world. The scientific (and social) shocks caused by such exhibitions were carefully encased by the neoclassical architecture of the exposition’s halls. It was as if the unknown but certain chaotic consequences of the scientific and industrial exhibitions required the reassurance and controls suggested by the neoclassical architecture. The real control, however, occupied thirty acres of space and became one of the most popular displays: the U.S. navy’s exhibition of the new “Great White Fleet,” including full-sized and perfect models of the first American battleships, which had been authorized three years earlier.17","['1893', 'nineteenth-century', 'three years']",great columbian exposition chicago world ’s fair 1893 case study new u.s industrial power young navy wed industrial exhibition breathtaking demonstration new dynamo machine rock henry adams defy law physics history base nineteenth century world scientific social shock cause exhibition carefully encase neoclassical architecture exposition ’s hall unknown certain chaotic consequence scientific industrial exhibition require reassurance control suggest neoclassical architecture real control occupy thirty acre space popular display u.s navy ’s exhibition new “ great white fleet ” include sized perfect model battleship authorize year earlier.17,86,[1893],1893,1,1900,1900
528,"The fleet was the fitting centerpiece of the World’s Fair for several reasons. First, it represented national achievement and honor, and in this sense well symbolized the amazing growth in recent years of patriotic organizations (such as the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Naval Order of the United States, and the U.S. Daughters of 1812). These groups represented the “grand wave of patriotism,” as one observer called it, that washed over Americans in the post-1880 years as they sought a historical refuge amid the unpredictability of the Second Industrial Revolution. The growing U.S. military, led by the glamour and technological breakthroughs of the Great White Fleet, represented the perfect object for such patriotism – a patriotism caught in 1897 by the Marine Corps Band director, John Phillip Sousa, when he penned the new national march, “The Stars and Stripes Forever.” Second, the fleet exhibition also was the appropriate centerpiece because it necessarily complemented the vast industrial and scientific displays. As major U.S. economic interests led the world and spread to its four corners, they also helped cause the disruptions that inevitably occurred when economic development clashed with political and social tradition (and when foreign intrusion conflicted with nationalism). The navy then had to be present, prepared, and superior.","['recent years', 'the post-1880 years', '1897']",fleet fitting centerpiece world ’s fair reason represent national achievement honor sense symbolize amazing growth recent year patriotic organization daughter revolution naval order united state u.s daughter 1812 group represent “ grand wave patriotism ” observer call wash american post-1880 year seek historical refuge amid unpredictability second industrial revolution grow u.s military lead glamour technological breakthrough great white fleet represent perfect object patriotism – patriotism catch 1897 marine corps band director john phillip sousa pen new national march “ star stripe forever ” second fleet exhibition appropriate centerpiece necessarily complement vast industrial scientific display major u.s economic interest lead world spread corner help because disruption inevitably occur economic development clash political social tradition foreign intrusion conflict nationalism navy present prepared superior,121,"[1880, 1897]",1888,2,1900,1900

The Civil War fleet had nearly disintegrated, but not its personnel, at least numerically: There was approximately one officer for each enlisted man.

They found support from iron- and steelmakers, as well as shipbuilders, whose successful attempts to find relief from the economic depression in government appropriations for warships made these “the formative years of America’s Military-Industrial Complex,” to use Benjamin Franklin Cooling’s phrase. Consequently, in 1882, contracts for the first four modern U.S. warships were let to shipbuilder John Roach. He anticipated later chapters of the military-industrial complex by having huge cost overruns, production breakdowns, and a failure to keep up with shifting navy standards.

531,"At another level, two other figures appeared to provide the strategic and political rationale for the new navy. The first was Benjamin Harrison’s secretary of the navy, Benjamin Tracy. A strong imperialist, successful New York lawyer, and able politician, Tracy released annual reports in 1889 and 1890 that successfully demanded appropriations for the first three modern armored battleships. Tracy wove together the lessons of the Samoa crisis with the radical thinking emerging from the new Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island. He also took advantage of the Republicans having gained control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1875 and pushed a series of naval measures through the legislature along largely partisan lines.19","['annual', '1889', '1890', '1875']",level figure appear provide strategic political rationale new navy benjamin harrison ’s secretary navy benjamin tracy strong imperialist successful new york lawyer able politician tracy release annual report 1889 1890 successfully demand appropriation modern armored battleship tracy wove lesson samoa crisis radical thinking emerge new naval war college newport rhode island take advantage republicans have gain control house congress time 1875 push series naval measure legislature largely partisan lines.19,69,"[1889, 1890, 1875]",1885,3,1900,1900
532,"The other figure who appeared at the same time was Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan. A Democrat, frustrated antiimperialist, middle-aged naval officer in the mid-1880s, he suddenly discovered in his reading of ancient Rome the key that he and his colleagues in the dead-end officer corps had been seeking: proof, as he read the history, that it was control of the sea, not of land, that determined crucial turns in Rome’s imperial development. After developing his theory at the new Naval War College, Mahan published his magisterial book The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783 in 1890, just at the time of the Samoan crisis and Tracy’s 1890 annual report. Mahan directly linked the central event of his era – the growing productivity of U.S. factories and farms – to the need for a great battleship fleet that could protect the nation’s foreign commerce, destroy an opponent’s commerce in battle, and annihilate the opponent’s fleet in decisive combat. Such a navy required coaling bases and rest stops. Mahan thus demanded the annexation of bases in the Caribbean and the Pacific. He turned Republican in 1893 after Cleveland rejected annexation of Hawaii. Mahan’s work quickly made him an intimate of the powerful people who wanted a great fleet, not least young Theodore Roosevelt, who gave the 1890 book a rousing review in Atlantic Monthly (“our greatest need is the need of a fighting fleet,” he concluded). By the mid-1890s, Mahan was lionized in London, Berlin, and Tokyo as well as Washington. “The London Times has been calling me Copernicus again,” he proudly wrote home in 1894. “Copernicus taught that the sun was the center of the system … and I have been the first to show that sea power is the center around which other events move, not it around them.”20","['the mid-1880s', '1890', '1890', 'annual', 'era –', '–', '1893', '1890', 'the mid-1890s', '1894']",figure appear time captain alfred thayer mahan democrat frustrated antiimperialist middle aged naval officer mid-1880 suddenly discover reading ancient rome key colleague dead end officer corp seek proof read history control sea land determine crucial turn rome ’s imperial development develop theory new naval war college mahan publish magisterial book influence sea power history 1660–1783 1890 time samoan crisis tracy ’s 1890 annual report mahan directly link central event era – grow productivity u.s factory farm – need great battleship fleet protect nation ’s foreign commerce destroy opponent ’s commerce battle annihilate opponent ’s fleet decisive combat navy require coaling base rest stop mahan demand annexation base caribbean pacific turn republican 1893 cleveland reject annexation hawaii mahan ’s work quickly intimate powerful people want great fleet young theodore roosevelt give 1890 book rousing review atlantic monthly “ great need need fight fleet ” conclude mid-1890 mahan lionize london berlin tokyo washington “ london time call copernicus ” proudly write home 1894 “ copernicus teach sun center system … sea power center event them.”20,173,"[1880, 1890, 1890, 1893, 1890, 1890, 1894]",1890,7,1900,1900
533,"Mahan understood other implications of his reading of history. He preached that the new United States needed a new presidency that could act quickly and decisively abroad, instead of being tied down by outdated political tenets and an eighteenth-century constitution. Mahan provided the rationale for the twentieth-century presidency, created by foreign policy crises and unfettered by congressional checks and balances, that was first represented by William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. Mahan’s theory also explained why the U.S. merchant marine, which had rapidly disappeared since its historic high point in 1860, was not really needed. Anyone could carry the goods; capital should go into more efficient production or into battleship fleets to protect that commerce. In all, he underlined the need for growing foreign markets and hence the need for a navy. Squadron maneuvers were impossible to practice, Mahan observed in late 1895: “Just as we expect them to begin, a bobbery starts up in Central or South America, or Hayti, or elsewhere, and away go one or two ships.”22","['eighteenth-century', 'twentieth-century', '1860', 'late 1895']",mahan understand implication reading history preach new united state need new presidency act quickly decisively abroad instead tie outdated political tenet eighteenth century constitution mahan provide rationale twentieth century presidency create foreign policy crisis unfettered congressional check balance represent william mckinley theodore roosevelt mahan ’s theory explain u.s merchant marine rapidly disappear historic high point 1860 need carry good capital efficient production battleship fleet protect commerce underline need grow foreign market need navy squadron maneuver impossible practice mahan observe late 1895 “ expect begin bobbery start central south america hayti away ships.”22,92,"[1860, 1895]",1878,2,1900,1900

A pivotal outbreak, much more than a bobbery, occurred during 1894–5 in Asia, a theater that had come to fascinate Mahan, as it had Seward a generation earlier. By early 1895, Asia was also fascinating the Cleveland administration and business leaders.","['the 1890s', 'early 1895']",“ bobberie ” appear increase frequency 1890s pivotal outbreak bobbery occur 1894–5 asia theater come fascinate mahan seward generation earlier early 1895 asia fascinating cleveland administration business leader,28,"[1890, 1895]",1892,2,1900,1900
535,"Until 1894 a delicate balance of power had been maintained by the British presence and China’s presumed ability to defend itself. In reality the balance had been undermined by the Japanese, and then American, opening of Korea between 1876 and 1882. Korea moved out of direct Chinese control as Japanese industrial and military power developed. Simultaneously, another piece of the Asian puzzle became eccentric as Russia, led by its visionary finance minister, Count Sergei Witte, lay its Trans-Siberian Railway toward Manchuria and regions that, in Japan’s eyes, directly threatened its security. This destabilization of East Asia was helped along by the influx of foreign goods and missionaries. As U.S. minister to China Charles Denby noted, the two were linked: “The missionary inspired by holy zeal, goes everywhere, and by degrees foreign commerce and trade follow.”23","['1894', 'between 1876 and 1882']",1894 delicate balance power maintain british presence china ’s presume ability defend reality balance undermine japanese opening korea 1876 1882 korea move direct chinese control japanese industrial military power develop simultaneously piece asian puzzle eccentric russia lead visionary finance minister count sergei witte lie trans siberian railway manchuria region japan ’s eye directly threaten security destabilization east asia help influx foreign good missionary u.s minister china charles denby note link missionary inspire holy zeal go degree foreign commerce trade follow.”23,80,[1894],1894,1,1900,1900
536,"The tipping over of the delicate balance began when Japan seized upon an antiforeign incident in Korea to declare war against China in April 1894. As the Japanese stunned the world by scoring quick, decisive victories, European powers finally moved to block Tokyo by trying to mediate the conflict. They also asked Gresham to act with them, an offer the secretary of state refused. He was not reversing Seward’s cooperative policy; indeed, U.S. warships worked with European fleets in securing China’s open ports, and Gresham moved U.S. marines into Korea to help protect foreigners and their property. But, as he had warned the Japanese, they were not to push for a total victory, or else Europeans would interfere to “demand a settlement not favorable to Japan’s future security and well-being.” Gresham finally unilaterally offered U.S. good offices to prevent such a result. In the peace talks, Japan won nearly everything it demanded: a large indemnity from China, Korea’s independence, the cession of Formosa to Tokyo, and extensive new trade concessions for foreigners involved in China’s trade. Above all, Japan received rights to the strategic Liaotung Peninsula, a gateway to Manchuria, and thus was suddenly in the position to block Russia and exploit some of Asia’s potentially richest markets. Then, in late 1895, a Japanese-inspired coup placed a pro-Tokyo regime in charge of Korea. The most important U.S. diplomat in Seoul, Horace Allen, bitterly protested and tried to bring in a Russian presence to balance the Japanese. The State Department reprimanded him and disavowed his policy.24","['April 1894', 'late 1895']",tipping delicate balance begin japan seize antiforeign incident korea declare war china april 1894 japanese stun world score quick decisive victory european power finally move block tokyo try mediate conflict ask gresham act offer secretary state refuse reverse seward ’s cooperative policy u.s warship work european fleet secure china ’s open port gresham move u.s marine korea help protect foreigner property warn japanese push total victory europeans interfere “ demand settlement favorable japan ’s future security ” gresham finally unilaterally offer u.s good office prevent result peace talk japan win nearly demand large indemnity china korea ’s independence cession formosa tokyo extensive new trade concession foreigner involve china ’s trade japan receive right strategic liaotung peninsula gateway manchuria suddenly position block russia exploit asia ’s potentially rich market late 1895 japanese inspire coup place pro tokyo regime charge korea important u.s diplomat seoul horace allen bitterly protest try bring russian presence balance japanese state department reprimand disavow policy.24,158,"[1894, 1895]",1894,2,1900,1900
537,"Indeed, throughout 1894–5 Gresham, and then Olney, supported the Japanese with few reservations. Washington’s June 8, 1895, note to its diplomats in China demanded, in words strikingly similar to the famous Open Door notes of four years later, equal and liberal trade access in both Korea and China. Japan was seen as a strong supporter of the Open Door and as an enemy of the Russian, German, and French attempts to cordon off parts of China for their own private exploitation. Even when Japan moved to seize all of Korea, the United States showed little displeasure. Not so the Europeans. As Gresham had predicted, they shocked Japan in 1895–6 by forcing Tokyo officials to surrender claims on Korea and, especially, to give up the Liaotung Peninsula’s entrance into Manchuria. Witte had drawn the line. He convinced Tsar Nicholas II that Russian forces would be in no position to determine China’s future until the Trans-Siberian Railway was open, probably in the early twentieth century. Until then, Witte argued, St. Petersburg could not agree to any other power, especially Japan, obtaining a head start. With French and German help, Witte forced Japan to surrender much of what it had obtained in its negotiations with China. Neither a sympathetic Washington nor London could help. The Japanese fell back and worked furiously to prepare their industry and military for the unavoidable showdown with Russia.25","['June 8, 1895', 'four years later', '1895–6', 'the early twentieth century']",1894–5 gresham olney support japanese reservation washington ’s june 8 1895 note diplomat china demand word strikingly similar famous open door note year later equal liberal trade access korea china japan see strong supporter open door enemy russian german french attempt cordon part china private exploitation japan move seize korea united state show little displeasure europeans gresham predict shock japan 1895–6 force tokyo official surrender claim korea especially liaotung peninsula ’s entrance manchuria witte draw line convince tsar nicholas ii russian force position determine china ’s future trans siberian railway open probably early twentieth century witte argue st petersburg agree power especially japan obtain head start french german help witte force japan surrender obtain negotiation china sympathetic washington london help japanese fall work furiously prepare industry military unavoidable showdown russia.25,130,"[1895, 1895]",1895,2,1900,1900
538,"Closely monitoring the sharpening conflict over a disintegrating China, Americans followed a two-prong policy. On one, they showed sympathy and admiration for the Japanese. As the Philadelphia Press wrote in late 1895, “Americans cannot but wish them success. Nippon is indeed the day-star of the East. Its future is indicated by a rising not a setting sun.” The other part of the policy was to push U.S. economic interests as hard as possible in the race to exploit China through its new treaty ports and newly gained access to the interior. The object was not stability but profits. Denby stressed that U.S. concession hunters could find good game because China needed money to pay the indemnity. The U.S. minister grew furious when foreign governments helped their entrepreneurs cut deals with the vulnerable Chinese officials; he demanded that Washington allow him to do the same. In 1895–6, Olney set a precedent by instructing Denby to assist U.S. business executives to gain access to key Chinese officials, although the minister was not to play favorites among the Americans. Intensifying international competition had forced the discard of another piece of laissez-faireism.26","['late 1895', '1895–6']",closely monitor sharpen conflict disintegrate china american follow prong policy show sympathy admiration japanese philadelphia press write late 1895 “ american wish success nippon day star east future indicate rise set sun ” policy push u.s economic interest hard possible race exploit china new treaty port newly gain access interior object stability profit denby stress u.s concession hunter find good game china need money pay indemnity u.s minister grow furious foreign government help entrepreneur cut deal vulnerable chinese official demand washington allow 1895–6 olney set precedent instruct denby assist u.s business executive gain access key chinese official minister play favorite american intensify international competition force discard piece laissez faireism.26,109,"[1895, 1895]",1895,2,1900,1900
539,"The new policy, however, was insufficient. So was the banqueting and flattering of China’s foreign policy leader, Li Hung-chang, when he visited the United States. Olney and Denby supported the American China Development Company’s attempt to obtain the rich Peking-Hankow railway concession. Organized in 1895, the company included members such as powerful robber barons James Stillman, president of National City Bank and adviser to the Rockefellers; Jacob H. Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb, and Company; E. H. Harriman; and Carnegie. The effort, however, fell victim to quiet British opposition, Chinese demands, and, most of all, the company’s own undercapitalization. In 1896, meanwhile, the Russians signed the Li-Lobanov Treaty, which gave them control of the Chinese Eastern Railway as a terminal point for the Trans-Siberian. The Chinese were desperately trying to balance the Russians and the Japanese. To Americans, however, Russia had emerged as the real, and threatening, victor of the 1894–5 war. “This war,” wrote the secretary of the U.S. legation, Charles Denby, Jr., “has done more to open this vast field to Western commerce and civilization than five hundred years of foreign trade and one hundred years of missionary teaching.” Cramp Shipbuilding, the Union Iron Works, Bethlehem Iron, and other U.S. concession seekers had tried to enter that “vast field” after 1895, but with little success compared with Russia’s achievements. In truth, Americans were discovering a less mythical, more real, Japan market. U.S. shipbuilders obtained rich contracts for the new Japanese battleship fleet, Japan doubled its cotton imports from the United States, and, in return, Japanese manufactured goods found surprisingly good American sales. As China weakened, a new economic and political alignment was developing among the great powers, an alignment that would shape U.S. foreign policy well into the next century.27","['1895', '1896', 'five hundred years', 'one hundred years', '1895']",new policy insufficient banqueting flattering china ’s foreign policy leader li hung chang visit united state olney denby support china development company ’s attempt obtain rich peking hankow railway concession organize 1895 company include member powerful robber baron james stillman president national city bank adviser rockefeller jacob h. schiff kuhn loeb company e. h. harriman carnegie effort fall victim quiet british opposition chinese demand company ’s undercapitalization 1896 russian sign li lobanov treaty give control chinese eastern railway terminal point trans siberian chinese desperately try balance russian japanese american russia emerge real threatening victor 1894–5 war “ war ” write secretary u.s legation charles denby jr “ open vast field western commerce civilization year foreign trade year missionary teaching ” cramp shipbuilding union iron work bethlehem iron u.s concession seeker try enter “ vast field ” 1895 little success compare russia ’s achievement truth american discover mythical real japan market u.s shipbuilder obtain rich contract new japanese battleship fleet japan double cotton import united state return japanese manufacture good find surprisingly good sale china weaken new economic political alignment develop great power alignment shape u.s foreign policy century.27,188,"[1895, 1896, 1895]",1895,3,1900,1900
540,"The first occurred in the harbor of Rio de Janeiro. In 1891, U.S.-Brazilian ties tightened when the two nations signed one of the most important reciprocity treaties that emerged from the 1890 tariff bill. Those ties were further strengthened when the Brazilian republic, which had replaced the monarchy in 1889, looked to the United States as a model. In 1893, however, elements of the Brazilian navy rebelled against the republic. The rebels were helped, carefully and quietly, by British interests, who saw this as a chance to check the growing U.S. influence. The rebels announced their intention of breaking the government by sealing off trade, and hence customs collections, in Rio’s harbor. The U.S. naval commander agreed to honor the blockade. He was promptly removed by Gresham and replaced by a new commander, who, perhaps because of his earlier service in Asian waters, understood gunboat diplomacy.","['1891', '1889', '1893']",occur harbor rio de janeiro 1891 u.s .- brazilian tie tighten nation sign important reciprocity treaty emerge 1890 tariff bill tie strengthen brazilian republic replace monarchy 1889 look united state model 1893 element brazilian navy rebel republic rebel help carefully quietly british interest see chance check grow u.s influence rebel announce intention break government seal trade custom collection rio ’s harbor u.s naval commander agree honor blockade promptly remove gresham replace new commander early service asian water understand gunboat diplomacy,80,"[1891, 1889, 1893]",1891,3,1900,1900

Julian Pauncefote, London’s ambassador, admired Gresham (especially in comparison with Blaine and his blatant anti-British activities), and Gresham returned the friendship. But mutual admiration did not stop the secretary of state from ordering U.S. warships to accompany American merchantmen to Rio’s customhouses, and to use force if necessary. When the rebels challenged the convoy in late January 1894, the U.S. commander fired a shell across the bow of the rebel ship. The rebels backed away. The revolt ended and Rio again was open to a free flow of goods.

542,"A second confrontation erupted at the Mosquito Indian Reservation on the Atlantic Coast enclave of Nicaragua. The English-speaking Indians and blacks were separated from the distant Managua government by language, history, and impenetrable jungle, and – since 1860 – had been a British protectorate. London had grown fond of the Mosquito because it would be the Atlantic entrance for a future Nicaraguan isthmian canal. British investors, moreover, had profited from the region’s natural wealth, especially its mahogany forests. Since the mid-1880s, however, hundreds of Americans had built up $2 million in investments and $4 million in trade with the United States.

London did so, only to have the foreign investors, led by Americans, demand that the British be allowed to protect them against Zelaya. Their fear was made real when Zelaya began to arrest British subjects. London threatened to protect its citizens with force. Gresham was trapped between his view of the Monroe Doctrine and the demands of the American investors. He finally managed to uphold both the Doctrine and the investors’ rights by reassuring the Americans and the British that he would guard all their interests.

544,"The third crisis threatened to become a war. In retrospect, the danger was overblown, but it became one of those transforming events that changed a fundamental diplomatic relationship of the United States and marked a recognition of U.S. power that would have been unimaginable in Seward’s time. Its roots lay a half-century before, when London laid claim to disputed territory between British Guiana and Venezuela. The problem largely lay dormant until the 1890s, when it appeared that Great Britain was beginning to assume that it controlled the territory. Venezuela brought the issue before the Cleveland administration, not least by hiring a lobbyist, William L. Scruggs, who effectively publicized Venezuela’s view. Among other issues, Scruggs noted that the disputed territory included the Orinoco River, and that the waterway could control commerce into vast South American markets. By now, Americans were highly sensitive to British ambitions in the hemisphere and the European imperialists’ carving up of other southern continents. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge (R.-Mass.), a close friend of Roosevelt and Mahan, provided a historical context for the Venezuelan claim: “These [European] powers have already seized the islands of the Pacific and parcelled out Africa. Great Britain cannot extend her possessions in the East…. She is now turning her attention to South America.”30","['half-century', 'the 1890s']",crisis threaten war retrospect danger overblown transform event change fundamental diplomatic relationship united state mark recognition u.s power unimaginable seward ’s time root lie half century london lay claim dispute territory british guiana venezuela problem largely lie dormant 1890s appear great britain begin assume control territory venezuela bring issue cleveland administration hire lobbyist william l. scruggs effectively publicize venezuela ’s view issue scruggs note dispute territory include orinoco river waterway control commerce vast south market american highly sensitive british ambition hemisphere european imperialists’ carve southern continent senator henry cabot lodge r .- mass close friend roosevelt mahan provide historical context venezuelan claim “ european power seize island pacific parcel africa great britain extend possession east … turn attention south america.”30,120,[1890],1890,1,1900,1900

This letter probably was indirectly referring to the clash over the Mosquito Reservation, but Whitehall could have been excused for reading a broader meaning into the rather obsequious message.31 Gresham, however, died shortly after writing the note and was replaced by Olney. In July Olney delivered a quite different message. Demanding that the Monroe Doctrine be honored, and that the British refer the Venezuelan dispute to arbitration, Olney added, for London’s information, that “today the United States is practically sovereign on this continent, and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition.” The secretary of state explained why this was so in phrases that again would have been unheard a generation earlier: The “infinite resources” of the United States, “combined with its isolated position render it master of the situation and practically invulnerable as against any and all powers.”","['April 12, 1895', 'July', 'today', 'a generation earlier']",british undisturbed secret letter recently discover gresham assure london april 12 1895 thorough friendship people ” emphasize u.s fleet movement caribbean mean hostile british interest letter probably indirectly refer clash mosquito reservation whitehall excuse read broad meaning obsequious message.31 gresham die shortly write note replace olney july olney deliver different message demand monroe doctrine honor british refer venezuelan dispute arbitration olney add london ’s information “ today united state practically sovereign continent fiat law subject confine interposition ” secretary state explain phrase unheard generation earlier “ infinite resource ” united state “ combine isolated position render master situation practically invulnerable power,101,[1895],1895,1,1900,1900

547,"The relative decline in British industrial power, combined with the growing competition with Germany, led to Joseph Chamberlain (the former British secretary of state for the colonies), referring to this “weary Titan, staggering under the too vast orb of his own fate.” One historian has concluded that the British moved to resolve this dilemma by “appeasing” the United States so that they could avoid a war with Anglo-Saxon brothers and sisters. London could then be better prepared to fight elsewhere. A potential enemy was thus transformed into a needed friend. Only the Latin Americans seemed to have felt they lost. If Washington won its point with Salisbury, the Chilean minister to Washington observed, “the United States will have succeeded in establishing a protectorate over all of Latin America.” Latin American editorials discussed “the suffocating pressure of the Colossus,” whose Anglo-Saxon race sought to “found a single colonial state extending from the North to the South Pole.” John Bassett Moore privately expressed a more modest and accurate evaluation in late 1895: “Since the [economic] panic two years ago, there has grown up quite a war party” in the United States, which “thinks that a war would be a good thing for the country.”33","['late 1895', 'two years ago']",relative decline british industrial power combine grow competition germany lead joseph chamberlain british secretary state colony refer “ weary titan stagger vast orb fate ” historian conclude british move resolve dilemma “ appease ” united state avoid war anglo saxon brother sister london better prepared fight potential enemy transform need friend latin american feel lose washington win point salisbury chilean minister washington observe “ united state succeed establish protectorate latin america ” latin editorial discuss “ suffocate pressure colossus ” anglo saxon race seek “ find single colonial state extend north south pole ” john bassett moore privately express modest accurate evaluation late 1895 “ economic panic year ago grow war party ” united state “ think war good thing country.”33,121,[1895],1895,1,1900,1900

In New England, where they had been strong for generations, they were virtually wiped out as their eight House members were reduced to one (“Honey-Fitz” Fitzgerald, John F. Kennedy’s grandfather). What the economy missed doing to the Democrats, their choice of candidates did. Until the mid-1890s, many ethnic groups especially favored the Democrats because they believed in limited government and had left the ethnic minorities alone. William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1896, was, however, a midwestern pietist who believed deeply in social improvement and Protestant mission. His opponent, William McKinley, played down the Republican pietist tradition and ran a more inclusive campaign, the kind of campaign he had learned to conduct as a House member, and then governor, in multiethnic Ohio politics.

550,"Foreign policy played a minor role. The 1896 Democratic platform bowed before the Monroe Doctrine and extended “sympathy” to Cubans for their revolution, which had reerupted a year earlier. The Republicans devoted more attention to overseas affairs. They asked that Hawaii be “controlled” by the United States (not directly mentioning annexation); that a Nicaraguan canal and a Danish West Indies naval base be obtained; that the Monroe Doctrine be upheld and “the eventual withdrawal of the European powers from this hemisphere” take place; and that Spain’s retreat from Cuba – or the use of U.S. “good offices to restore peace and give independence to the Island” – occur. Populist party leaders endorsed Bryan and took a strong pro-Cuban stand, in part because such a stand was popular in the West, where war fever was rising, and in part because they hoped it would be attractive to those who disliked the Populists’ pro-silver passion. McKinley emphasized a tariff policy of protectionism plus reciprocity. The British disliked McKinley until they saw that Bryan, with his silverite cry (“Gold monometallism is a British policy,” the Democratic party plank blared), was infinitely worse.","['1896', 'a year earlier', '–']",foreign policy play minor role 1896 democratic platform bow monroe doctrine extend “ sympathy ” cuban revolution reerupt year earlier republican devote attention overseas affair ask hawaii “ control ” united state directly mention annexation nicaraguan canal danish west indie naval base obtain monroe doctrine uphold “ eventual withdrawal european power hemisphere ” place spain ’s retreat cuba – use u.s “ good office restore peace independence island ” – occur populist party leader endorse bryan take strong pro cuban stand stand popular west war fever rise hop attractive dislike populists’ pro silver passion mckinley emphasize tariff policy protectionism plus reciprocity british dislike mckinley see bryan silverite cry “ gold monometallism british policy ” democratic party plank blare infinitely bad,120,[1896],1896,1,1900,1900
551,"In the end, McKinley not only ran a well-financed, highly organized campaign that appealed to populous urban areas in the Midwestern and Northeastern states, but he also became lucky when the favorable U.S. export balance shot up from $46 million in the last one-third of 1895 to $96 million in the comparable 1896 months. This surplus, in addition to a slowing of selling by Europeans of U.S. securities and a sudden rise in world gold production, brought the precious metal into the country in larger quantities, raised prices, began to lift the economic cloud, and dimmed silver’s appeal.35","['the last one-third of 1895', 'the comparable 1896 months']",end mckinley run finance highly organize campaign appeal populous urban area midwestern northeastern state lucky favorable u.s export balance shoot 46 million 1895 96 million comparable 1896 month surplus addition slowing sell europeans u.s security sudden rise world gold production bring precious metal country large quantity raise price begin lift economic cloud dim silver ’s appeal.35,56,"[1895, 1896]",1896,2,1900,1900

Republicans became so dominant in the more populous and wealthy North, and the Democrats more fixed in power in the much poorer, less populated South, that not only was Republican ascendancy in place for all except eight of the next thirty-six years, but also the resulting one-party states discouraged voter participation. The American elite – bankers, industrialists, and large commercial farmers, led by McKinley – thus became insulated against radicalism. Foreign policy could be conducted on the basis of this solid, growing consensus, with little danger of the sudden turns marked, say, by Cleveland’s repudiation of Harrison’s Hawaiian annexation policy in 1893. The results thus turned out to be every president’s dream. With obvious relief, Mahan wrote a friend after the election that it had been the “most important” event of the time, and “I don’t except the [Civil] War.” Bryan’s platform, “wrong and even revolutionary,” had been repudiated.36 Mahan and McKinley were prepared to take the leap from the chaos of the mid-1890s to an overseas empire of the new twentieth century.","['the next thirty-six years', 'McKinley –', '1893', 'the mid-1890s', 'the new twentieth century']",mckinley win 271 electoral vote bryan ’s 176 republican dominant populous wealthy north democrats fix power poor populate south republican ascendancy place thirty year result party state discourage voter participation elite – banker industrialist large commercial farmer lead mckinley – insulated radicalism foreign policy conduct basis solid grow consensus little danger sudden turn mark cleveland ’s repudiation harrison ’s hawaiian annexation policy 1893 result turn president ’s dream obvious relief mahan write friend election “ important ” event time “ not civil war ” bryan ’s platform “ wrong revolutionary ” repudiated.36 mahan mckinley prepared leap chaos mid-1890 overseas empire new twentieth century,103,"[1893, 1890]",1892,2,1900,1900

The first, forced by the 1890 tariff, occurred in Hawaii during 1893 and led to American annexation in 1898. The second, caused by the sugar provisions of the 1894 Wilson-Gorman Tariff, created chaos in Cuba. Between 1894 and 1896, Cuba’s exports to its best customer, the United States, fell 50 percent. The results were revolt, then war, then a new U.S. empire in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and – as an integral part of these developments – a new U.S. executive that evolved precisely to try to create a modicum of efficiency and stability from a foreign policy that gave priority to commercial opportunity, domestic politics, and strategic power.","['the 1890s', '1890', '1893', '1898', '1894', 'Between 1894 and 1896', '–']",simply manipulate tariff schedule united state trigger revolution 1890s accelerate philippines force 1890 tariff occur hawaii 1893 lead annexation 1898 second cause sugar provision 1894 wilson gorman tariff create chaos cuba 1894 1896 cuba ’s export good customer united state fall 50 percent result revolt war new u.s empire caribbean pacific – integral development – new u.s executive evolve precisely try create modicum efficiency stability foreign policy give priority commercial opportunity domestic politic strategic power,75,"[1890, 1890, 1893, 1898, 1894]",1893,5,1900,1900

In 1892 alone, U.S. investors put in $1.2 million. When the 1894 tariff act threatened to paralyze both the sugar and the cigar-making industries, unemployment spread and revolution erupted.

Martí was deported to Spain and then went to New York, where he lived as a journalist during most of the 1881–95 era. Watching Americans closely, he concluded in 1889 that the country was becoming “plutocratic and imperialistic.” When Cuban cane cutters, cigar makers, and other laborers went on strike in 1895, Martí was the leader able to bridge class and racial boundaries to piece together a Cuban nationalist force. Declaring, notably, that “Cuba must be free from Spain and the United States,” he landed in Cuba in April to lead the revolution. On May 19, 1895, he was killed by Spanish troops in an ambush.1","['1853', 'the age of seventeen', '1889', '1895', 'April', 'May 19, 1895']",bear 1853 son spanish military officer station cuba arrest danger state age seventeen revolt martí deport spain go new york live journalist 1881–95 era watch american closely conclude 1889 country “ plutocratic imperialistic ” cuban cane cutter cigar maker laborer go strike 1895 martí leader able bridge class racial boundary piece cuban nationalist force declare notably “ cuba free spain united state ” land cuba april lead revolution 19 1895 kill spanish troop ambush.1,74,"[1853, 1889, 1895, 1895]",1883,4,1900,1900

They initially wanted – as one of the richest U.S. planters, Edwin Atkins, put it to Secretary of State Richard Olney in 1896 – “autonomy,” or home rule. But as the revolt spread and became more radical in its demands, Atkins and his fellow planters began to consider the welcome protection provided by outright U.S. annexation. The second group, made up of the mass of Cubans, took its lead from one of Martí’s most famous statements: “Once the United States is in Cuba, who will get her out?” The rebels wanted complete independence. A much less important third group was loyalists who were so procolonial that they refused even to support the idea of autonomy within Spain’s ramshackle empire. Their intransigence, and the revolutionaries’ growing power, gave Madrid, Washington, and increasingly the concerned European capitals (including the Vatican, which had little enthusiasm for Americans taking over the Roman Catholic island) limited maneuvering room.2","['–', '1896']",comprise creole u.s investor accord state department ’s assessment 50 million island initially want – rich u.s planter edwin atkins secretary state richard olney 1896 – “ autonomy ” home rule revolt spread radical demand atkins fellow planter begin consider welcome protection provide outright u.s annexation second group mass cuban take lead martí ’s famous statement “ united state cuba ” rebel want complete independence important group loyalist procolonial refuse support idea autonomy spain ’s ramshackle empire intransigence revolutionaries’ grow power give madrid washington increasingly concerned european capital include vatican little enthusiasm american take roman catholic island limited maneuvering room.2,100,[1896],1896,1,1900,1900
558,"President Grover Cleveland wanted Spain to grant autonomy; that solution, he hoped, would appease the Cubans but hold Spain continually responsible for the protection of U.S. property. Washington-Madrid relations were good in 1895, but in 1896 the revolt spread, class differences widened, and the Spanish retaliated with 150,000 troops and a brutal reconcentrado policy of General Valeriano (“the Butcher”) Weyler, a policy that proved to be as ineffective as it was offensive to U.S. sensibilities. Cleveland, the president who had rejected Hawaii’s annexation in 1893, wanted no part of any plan that would bring the multiracial, class-riven island within the Union. By 1896, however, even his patience was ending. In one draft of his final annual message, he was prepared to give the Spanish a time limit to end the revolt, or else, he implied, the United States might have to do it for them. He backed off into generalities in the final paper, but his concern about U.S. investments, and about the growing anger and unpredictability that the revolt was generating in New York financial markets, pushed Cleveland toward a more active policy. “I am thinking a great deal about Cuba,” the president wrote Olney on July 13, 1896, “but am as far as ever from seeing the place where we can get in.”4","['1895', '1896', '1893', '1896', 'annual', 'July 13, 1896']","president grover cleveland want spain grant autonomy solution hop appease cuban hold spain continually responsible protection u.s property washington madrid relation good 1895 1896 revolt spread class difference widen spanish retaliate 150,000 troop brutal reconcentrado policy general valeriano “ butcher ” weyler policy prove ineffective offensive u.s sensibility cleveland president reject hawaii ’s annexation 1893 want plan bring multiracial class rive island union 1896 patience end draft final annual message prepared spanish time limit end revolt imply united state back generality final paper concern u.s investment grow anger unpredictability revolt generate new york financial market push cleveland active policy “ think great deal cuba ” president write olney july 13 1896 “ far see place in.”4",116,"[1895, 1896, 1893, 1896, 1896]",1895,5,1900,1900

The danger was that Spain would lose its control to Cuban revolutionaries who were uniting as the proautonomy and proannexation groups splintered. “There may be a revolution within a revolution,” U.S. Consul Fitzhugh Lee warned the State Department in 1897. “In that case foreigners will have to look to their government for protection and the preservation of peace.”5 North Americans could have come face-to-face at this point with their first twentieth-century revolution.

560,"Born in Niles, Ohio, in 1843, McKinley had been a Civil War hero. Elected to Congress in 1876, he had risen to the top rank of House leadership by 1890, only to be gerrymandered out of his district. He promptly ran for governor and won two terms between 1891 and 1895, despite having to handle massive labor unrest during the economic crash. By the mid-1890s he not only had survived Ohio politics, won the support of capital, and become a trusted friend of AFL leader Samuel Gompers, but also was acknowledged to be a leading expert on tariff policy and the political-economic needs of the Second Industrial Revolution. The first president whose inaugural parade was recorded by the new motion-picture camera, McKinley understood both the dangers of the long economic depression and the government’s necessary role in ending it. “The restoration of confidence and the revival of business …,” he declared, “depend more largely upon the prompt, energetic, and intelligent action of Congress than upon any other single agency affecting the situation.” McKinley was explicit. His “greatest ambition,” he told Wisconsin governor Robert LaFollette, was to attain U.S. supremacy in world markets.6","['1843', '1876', '1890', 'between 1891 and 1895', 'the mid-1890s']",bear niles ohio 1843 mckinley civil war hero elect congress 1876 rise rank house leadership 1890 gerrymander district promptly run governor win term 1891 1895 despite have handle massive labor unrest economic crash mid-1890 survive ohio politic win support capital trusted friend afl leader samuel gomper acknowledge lead expert tariff policy political economic need second industrial revolution president inaugural parade record new motion picture camera mckinley understand danger long economic depression government ’s necessary role end “ restoration confidence revival business … ” declare “ depend largely prompt energetic intelligent action congress single agency affect situation ” mckinley explicit “ great ambition ” tell wisconsin governor robert lafollette attain u.s supremacy world markets.6,113,"[1843, 1876, 1890, 1890]",1875,4,1900,1900
561,"To reach that pinnacle, the new president demanded that Congress pass two special measures. The first was a refined version of McKinley’s 1890 tariff measure. He wanted it all: “I believe in practical reciprocity,” he told a friend in 1895, a policy that “while seeking the world’s markets for our surplus products shall not destroy American wages or surrender American markets for products which can be made at home.” When he used a close variation of that sentence before the National Association of Manufacturers convention in 1895, he brought the audience to its feet in applause. John Hay, whom McKinley appointed ambassador to Great Britain in 1897, accurately characterized the theme of another, similar presidential speech to the NAM in early 1898: “The greatest destiny the world ever knew is ours.” The Dingley Tariff of 1897 did not give McKinley all he wanted; it nevertheless did refine and advance the reciprocity principle. John Kasson negotiated eleven such treaties, but at the time of McKinley’s death in 1901, the Senate had not acted on any of them.","['1890', '1895', '1895', '1897', 'early 1898', '1897', '1901']",reach pinnacle new president demand congress pass special measure refined version mckinley ’s 1890 tariff measure want “ believe practical reciprocity ” tell friend 1895 policy “ seek world ’s market surplus product shall destroy wage surrender market product home ” close variation sentence national association manufacturer convention 1895 bring audience foot applause john hay mckinley appoint ambassador great britain 1897 accurately characterize theme similar presidential speech nam early 1898 “ great destiny world know ” dingley tariff 1897 mckinley want refine advance reciprocity principle john kasson negotiate treaty time mckinley ’s death 1901 senate act,96,"[1890, 1895, 1895, 1897, 1898, 1897, 1901]",1896,7,1900,1900
562,"The second piece of legislation the president demanded was a gold standard act that would kill the silverite demands once and for all. McKinley had been a bimetalist and even wanted more silver coinage early in his career. By the 1890s he was a convinced gold advocate. His halfhearted approach to the British for a conference to discuss bimetalism had been rebuffed in late 1897, as McKinley probably knew it would be. Not only did the powerful banks in the City of London oppose such a proposal, but also “all the American banking interest has been enlisted in opposition,” Hay reported from London. The need for more money in circulation to finance an economic takeoff was being solved by both the discovery of more gold and a rising U.S. export table – a table that reported an unfavorable balance of $18.7 million in 1893, then a favorable $286 million balance in 1897, and double that amount in 1898. Exports soared over the billion-dollar mark in 1897. By 1900, McKinley had his Gold Standard Act, which declared the gold dollar to be the only currency standard. All other forms of money were to be maintained at parity with gold. The gold standard, Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage explained, enabled “us in our commercial affairs to measure with the same measure by which the industrial and commercial affairs of our great industrial competitors measure with.” Such a “great economic value,” Gage believed, “is worth very great sacrifice, if need be, to maintain it.” The tariff and the gold standard, combined with the new U.S. navy and closer government-business relations, created a “promotional state,” as historian Emily Rosenberg termed it, to push and protect U.S. business abroad.7","['the 1890s', 'late 1897', '1893', '1897', '1898', '1897', '1900']",second piece legislation president demand gold standard act kill silverite demand mckinley bimetalist want silver coinage early career 1890s convinced gold advocate halfhearted approach british conference discuss bimetalism rebuff late 1897 mckinley probably know powerful bank city london oppose proposal “ banking interest enlist opposition ” hay report london need money circulation finance economic takeoff solve discovery gold rise u.s export table – table report unfavorable balance 18.7 million 1893 favorable 286 million balance 1897 double 1898 export soar billion dollar mark 1897 1900 mckinley gold standard act declare gold dollar currency standard form money maintain parity gold gold standard secretary treasury lyman gage explain enable “ commercial affair measure measure industrial commercial affair great industrial competitor measure ” “ great economic value ” gage believe “ worth great sacrifice need maintain ” tariff gold standard combine new u.s navy close government business relation create “ promotional state ” historian emily rosenberg term push protect u.s business abroad.7,158,"[1890, 1897, 1893, 1897, 1898, 1897, 1900]",1896,7,1900,1900
563,"The post-1873 depression had forced tremendous sacrifices from Americans, but despite being in national politics much of the time, McKinley received little blame. He instead represented, as Henry Adams observed, “the instinct of what might be named McKinleyism: the system of combinations, consolidations, trusts, realized at home, and realizable abroad.” Adams, who was cynical about nearly everyone he watched from his home across Lafayette Square and the White House, called McKinley “a marvelous manager of men.

564,"Power was centralizing into presidential hands. This change, a transforming event in American history, began before the foreign policy watershed of the post-1898 years, but the change was shaped by that foreign policy. As historian Walter Dean Burnham described the results from what he termed the “system of 1896,” a “fairly democratic regime” was converted into “a rather broadly based oligarchy.” McKinley helped create and then manipulated this system to his advantage. In the first instance, he named a new cabinet that included fewer appointees with independent political bases, and more administrators whose political power depended on their allegiance to him. The new presidency – and the new industrializing, urbanizing, internationalizing United States – required a cabinet made up not merely of political representatives but of persons experienced in administering complex organizations in a world made smaller by communication and transportation technology. McKinley thus named as his secretary of state John Sherman, senator from Ohio, but only to create room in the Senate for the appointment of the president’s campaign manager, Mark Hanna. The de facto secretary of state was McKinley’s little-known, longtime Ohio friend William R. Day; he was followed by Hay (1898–1905), Elihu Root (1905–9), and Philander C. Knox (1909–13). All these men were widely experienced in the ways of corporate America and, without strong political bases of their own, dependent on the president’s will. In a centripetal-centrifugal effect, as U.S. foreign policy spread globally, authority over that policy centralized in the chief executive’s office.","['the post-1898 years', '1896', '–']",power centralize presidential hand change transform event history begin foreign policy watershed post-1898 year change shape foreign policy historian walter dean burnham describe result term “ system 1896 ” “ fairly democratic regime ” convert “ broadly base oligarchy ” mckinley help create manipulate system advantage instance name new cabinet include few appointee independent political base administrator political power depend allegiance new presidency – new industrialize urbanize internationalize united state – require cabinet merely political representative person experience administer complex organization world small communication transportation technology mckinley name secretary state john sherman senator ohio create room senate appointment president ’s campaign manager mark hanna de facto secretary state mckinley ’s little know longtime ohio friend william r. day follow hay 1898–1905 elihu root 1905–9 philander c. knox 1909–13 man widely experience way corporate america strong political base dependent president ’s centripetal centrifugal effect u.s foreign policy spread globally authority policy centralize chief executive ’s office,155,"[1898, 1896]",1897,2,1900,1900
565,"Presidential-congressional relations went through a similar transformation. Republican majorities in both the House and Senate increased steadily between 1897 and 1904; by the later date the Republicans controlled the Senate 53–29 (with 8 third-party representatives), and the House 198–151 (with 8 independents). The Senate, where the foreign policy fulcrum lay, was run as a club by a tight group of insiders who enjoyed immense power in shaping domestic affairs but usually deferred to McKinley in the foreign policy realm. The factions were closely linked to the post–Civil War economic interests. In 1902 political analyst Moisei Ostrogorski stated these interests “equipped and kept up political organizations for their own use, and ran them as they pleased, like their trains.”","['between 1897 and 1904', 'the later date', '53–29', '1902']",presidential congressional relation go similar transformation republican majority house senate increase steadily 1897 1904 later date republicans control senate 53–29 8 party representative house 198–151 8 independent senate foreign policy fulcrum lay run club tight group insider enjoy immense power shape domestic affair usually defer mckinley foreign policy realm faction closely link post – civil war economic interest 1902 political analyst moisei ostrogorski state interest “ equip keep political organization use run please like train,75,[1902],1902,1,1925,1950
566,"This view was only slightly exaggerated when applied to Washington decision making. The president’s role, one that McKinley and Roosevelt played brilliantly, was to provide an overarching foreign policy that benefited as many of these interests as possible. As the cosmopolitan of the system, the president created a policy that helped those functional groups that, in turn, most enriched the national interest – even if it meant, as it sometimes did, knocking heads in Congress to have the president’s program accepted. In the 1880s, recalled Massachusetts Republican senator George F. Hoar, senators visited the White House only to give advice.9 By 1898 they visited McKinley to receive advice as well. They then returned to a Senate where party loyalty, presidential patronage, and well-oiled caucus machinery delivered the vote for the White House. This was not always done easily. The president waged and won one of the toughest and historically significant battles in April 1898, when he took the country into war with Spain. First, however, he had to avoid an Asian crisis.","['the 1880s', '1898', 'April 1898']",view slightly exaggerated apply washington decision making president ’s role mckinley roosevelt play brilliantly provide overarch foreign policy benefit interest possible cosmopolitan system president create policy help functional group turn enrich national interest – mean knock head congress president ’s program accept 1880s recall massachusetts republican senator george f. hoar senator visit white house advice.9 1898 visit mckinley receive advice return senate party loyalty presidential patronage oil caucus machinery deliver vote white house easily president wag win tough historically significant battle april 1898 take country war spain avoid asian crisis,90,"[1880, 1898, 1898]",1892,3,1900,1900
567,"It was a measure of the new U.S. global power and the extent of American foreign interests that in 1897–8, McKinley was nearly drawn into a confrontation in Asia even as the nation’s eyes focused on Cuba and domestic problems. American interests in Asia were not military; in the late 1890s Great Britain had more battleships stationed in Asia than McKinley had first-class ships in his entire fleet. The interests were economic and missionary, and these had to be protected by Seward’s innovation of political cooperation with the powers and, if necessary, cooperative use of force. Missionaries, with help from Washington, which demanded such rights, were finally gaining permission from the Chinese government to work in some of the interior regions and not only along the seacoast. Meanwhile, the export of U.S. cotton goods to China jumped from $1.7 million in 1895 to $4 million in 1896, and $7.4 million in 1897.10","['the late 1890s', '1895', '1896']",measure new u.s global power extent foreign interest 1897–8 mckinley nearly draw confrontation asia nation ’s eye focus cuba domestic problem interest asia military late 1890s great britain battleship station asia mckinley class ship entire fleet interest economic missionary protect seward ’s innovation political cooperation power necessary cooperative use force missionary help washington demand right finally gain permission chinese government work interior region seacoast export u.s cotton good china jump 1.7 million 1895 4 million 1896 7.4 million 1897.10,79,"[1890, 1895, 1896]",1894,3,1900,1900

The Pacific Ocean is destined to bear on its bosom a larger commerce than the Atlantic,” and in a whole, noncolonized Asia, “we are destined to find our best customers.” Publicly, a McKinley mouthpiece in the Northeast, the New York Tribune, declared in March 1898 that “Slav-Tatar-Cossack rule means tyranny, ignorance, reaction.

As Day explained to the British in mid-March 1898, the United States sympathized with London’s (and Japan’s) policy, but the Cuban uprising made immediate U.S. cooperation impossible. The delay was made more tolerable when assurances came in from reluctant Berlin and St. Petersburg officials that they would agree to keep China’s ports open to world commerce. How dependable such assurances were was not clear to McKinley, who, as his private secretary noted, “appeared careworn, did not look well, and his eyes had a far away, deep set expression in them.”13","['As Day', 'mid-March 1898']",problem president major crisis doorstep deal free hand deal great question u.s interest asia day explain british mid march 1898 united state sympathize london ’s japan ’s policy cuban uprising immediate u.s cooperation impossible delay tolerable assurance come reluctant berlin st petersburg official agree china ’s port open world commerce dependable assurance clear mckinley private secretary note “ appear careworn look eye far away deep set expression them.”13,68,[1898],1898,1,1900,1900
571,"McKinley had good reason to appear careworn. He was about to lead the nation into war despite grave personal misgivings. He had little choice. The demands of the post–Civil War American system – at home, in the Caribbean, in Asia – required war. In his inaugural, McKinley had noted the delicate situation, and then declared, “We want no wars of conquest; we must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression.” This theme had been common to American statecraft after the Civil War as U.S. interests turned from continental territory to international markets. McKinley, however, meant it. His primary problem was to restore the nation’s economy. Foreign policy had to fit that objective. Consequently, throughout 1897 McKinley pushed Spain to end the revolt by granting more autonomy and stopping “Butcher” Weyler’s concentration camp policies. In November, Madrid recalled Weyler and outlined an autonomy plan that the rebels rejected and McKinley found disappointing.","['–', '1897', 'November']",mckinley good reason appear careworn lead nation war despite grave personal misgiving little choice demand post – civil war system – home caribbean asia – require war inaugural mckinley note delicate situation declare “ want war conquest avoid temptation territorial aggression ” theme common statecraft civil war u.s interest turn continental territory international market mckinley mean primary problem restore nation ’s economy foreign policy fit objective consequently 1897 mckinley push spain end revolt grant autonomy stop “ butcher ” weyler ’s concentration camp policy november madrid recall weyler outline autonomy plan rebel reject mckinley find disappointing,96,[1897],1897,1,1900,1900
572,"The turn to war occurred in January and February 1898. On January 12 Spanish army officers destroyed a Cuban newspaper that had attacked Weyler. Street riots erupted in Havana. Madrid disavowed the attack and promised calm, but McKinley apparently began to assume at this point that Spain could no longer maintain order. He dispatched the warship Maine to Havana harbor, ostensibly on a goodwill visit, in reality to protect U.S. citizens and property. In late February, the president’s view of Spain was reinforced by a long letter from E. A. Fuertes, a professor of engineering at Cornell University. Fuertes wrote that “Spain stands upon a volcano about to break into fearful eruption and needing only a misstep to precipitate a desolating revolution from the French frontier to the Mediterranean.” Familiar with the Iberian Peninsula, Fuertes emphasized that Spain was politically isolated in Europe. “A foreign war may tide Spain over its present crisis,” but it would be a short-term fix, he implied. McKinley, who asked that this letter be made “easily accessible” for his reference, could only read it as arguing that Spain, corrupt and in irreversible decline, could not be trusted to undertake real Cuban reforms.","['January', 'February 1898', 'January 12', 'late February']",turn war occur january february 1898 january 12 spanish army officer destroy cuban newspaper attack weyler street riot erupt havana madrid disavow attack promise calm mckinley apparently begin assume point spain longer maintain order dispatch warship maine havana harbor ostensibly goodwill visit reality protect u.s citizen property late february president ’s view spain reinforce long letter e. a. fuerte professor engineering cornell university fuerte write “ spain stand volcano break fearful eruption need misstep precipitate desolating revolution french frontier mediterranean ” familiar iberian peninsula fuerte emphasize spain politically isolated europe “ foreign war tide spain present crisis ” short term fix imply mckinley ask letter “ easily accessible ” reference read argue spain corrupt irreversible decline trust undertake real cuban reform,121,[1898],1898,1,1900,1900

Nor did the yellow-press journalism cry for war, generated by a circulation race between Joseph Pulitzer’s New York World and William Randolph Hearst’s Journal, push the president and the nation into conflict. McKinley refused to read sensational newspapers; in any case, the press had been demanding war since 1895 without effect.

Roosevelt briefed McKinley about the islands during relaxing buggy rides around Washington. On January 14, 1898, Roosevelt handed Long a nine-page letter outlining war preparations. A month later, while Long was away, Roosevelt sent orders to Admiral George Dewey of the Pacific fleet to prepare to attack Manila in case of war, and he also put other units on alert. The next day the surprised Long and McKinley quickly rescinded much of Roosevelt’s handiwork, but they approved the orders to Dewey. By April, war preparations were moving ahead, and Dewey was prepared to seize one of the most strategic points in the Asian region. McKinley was maneuvering the United States into position to deal simultaneously with crises in Cuba and China.15","['January 14, 1898', 'A month later', 'The next day', 'April']",philippine plan come blue war objective u.s navy long target philippine case war spain roosevelt brief mckinley island relax buggy ride washington january 14 1898 roosevelt hand long page letter outline war preparation month later long away roosevelt send order admiral george dewey pacific fleet prepare attack manila case war unit alert day surprised long mckinley quickly rescind roosevelt ’s handiwork approve order dewey april war preparation move ahead dewey prepared seize strategic point asian region mckinley maneuver united state position deal simultaneously crisis cuba china.15,86,[1898],1898,1,1900,1900
575,"On March 25, 1898, McKinley received a telegram from a political adviser and journalist in New York City, W. C. Reick: “Big corporations here now believe we will have war. Believe all would welcome it as relief to the suspense.” Trade journals were declaring that the chance of war had “stimulated the iron trade,” “been beneficial to the railroads,” and could “very decidedly enlarge the business of transportation.” Whitelaw Reid, the powerful publisher of The New York Tribune, took a cross-country trip and then assured McKinley on March 8 that “the more intelligent classes” cared little about “the sensational press” but would follow McKinley wherever he led, even if it meant war. If the leading business voices were ready for war, major Protestant religious bodies positively embraced it. McKinley, a devout Christian who paid attention to church leaders, and his political crony Mark Hanna were amazed at the outpouring of war spirit once Roman Catholic Cuba and the Philippines seemed to be obtainable. As one Methodist journal phrased it, “Our cause will be just…. Every Methodist preacher will be a recruiting officer.”16","['March 25, 1898', 'March 8']",march 25 1898 mckinley receive telegram political adviser journalist new york city w. c. reick “ big corporation believe war believe welcome relief suspense ” trade journal declare chance war “ stimulate iron trade ” “ beneficial railroad ” “ decidedly enlarge business transportation ” whitelaw reid powerful publisher new york tribune take cross country trip assure mckinley march 8 “ intelligent class ” care little “ sensational press ” follow mckinley lead mean war lead business voice ready war major protestant religious body positively embrace mckinley devout christian pay attention church leader political crony mark hanna amazed outpouring war spirit roman catholic cuba philippine obtainable methodist journal phrase because … methodist preacher recruiting officer.”16,115,[1898],1898,1,1900,1900
576,"In the end, McKinley sought war and domination in the Caribbean and the southern Pacific. His concern for order was strictly secondary. Indeed, if he sought stability, it was mostly at home, and for that he needed war and an extended military commitment to the two theaters. Only then, he believed, could he protect U.S. property in Cuba, stop the interminable and unsettling rebellion, and work with the British and Japanese to protect the Open Door in a crumbling China. If he had truly sought order, he had other alternatives, notably allowing Spain to try to crush the rebellion as it had in the 1870s, or recognizing the Cuban revolutionary government and allowing it to govern its own homeland.

577,"As a result of McKinley’s foreign policy choices in early 1898, the United States first went to war, then became responsible for a series of interventions in Cuba to protect U.S. interests, and next sank into a decade-long involvement in Asia that led to more war, conflict with Japan and Russia, and the acceleration of the Chinese revolution. The United States willingly assumed such burdens, never considered retreating from either Cuba or Asia, and accepted both war and revolution not in the naïve belief that they somehow produced order, but in the confidence that if properly exploited, they could produce more American power and opportunities. For such power and opportunities, disorder was a small price to pay.","['early 1898', 'decade']",result mckinley ’s foreign policy choice early 1898 united state go war responsible series intervention cuba protect u.s interest sink decade long involvement asia lead war conflict japan russia acceleration chinese revolution united state willingly assume burden consider retreat cuba asia accept war revolution naïve belief produce order confidence properly exploit produce power opportunity power opportunity disorder small price pay,60,[1898],1898,1,1900,1900
578,"The president used the war and his wartime powers to obtain the prize that he and his Republican party had sought since the days of Harrison, if not of Seward. In May 1898, McKinley asked Congress to pass a joint resolution to annex Hawaii. It was not his first try. In 1897 he had used the more traditional (and constitutional) approach of trying to obtain a two-thirds vote of the Senate to ratify an annexation treaty. His arguments were strong. For one, Hawaii was dominated by white planters who used the islands as an extension of the frontier in Oregon and California: In 1890 they sent 224 million pounds of sugar to the mainland; in 1896, 352 million pounds; and by 1898, shipments soared to a half-billion pounds. Hawaii’s sugar plantations were capitalized at $36.8 million; of this, $21.7 million was controlled by Americans, who also dominated the islands’ trade. For another, the Japanese population had grown to 24,000, or about one-quarter of the entire population, and was increasing rapidly. When the Japanese had arrived initially in large numbers during the mid-1880s, the Hawaiian king welcomed them as newcomers who would counterbalance the whites. Instead, the new immigrants became subjugated labor. Nevertheless, by 1890 whereas Hawaiians made up about 45 percent of the islands’ population, Chinese and Japanese accounted for 33 percent, and whites 21 percent. When McKinley moved to annex Hawaii in 1897, the Japanese government strongly objected. The situation grew so tense that the president dispatched the new battleship Oregon to Honolulu and secretly ordered the navy to seize the islands if Japan made any attempt to use force.","['the days', 'May 1898', '1897', '1890', '1896', '1898', 'the mid-1880s', '1890', '1897']","president war wartime power obtain prize republican party seek day harrison seward 1898 mckinley ask congress pass joint resolution annex hawaii try 1897 traditional constitutional approach try obtain third vote senate ratify annexation treaty argument strong hawaii dominate white planter island extension frontier oregon california 1890 send 224 million pound sugar mainland 1896 352 million pound 1898 shipment soar half billion pound hawaii ’s sugar plantation capitalize 36.8 million 21.7 million control american dominate islands’ trade japanese population grow 24,000 quarter entire population increase rapidly japanese arrive initially large number mid-1880 hawaiian king welcome newcomer counterbalance white instead new immigrant subjugate labor 1890 hawaiian 45 percent islands’ population chinese japanese account 33 percent white 21 percent mckinley move annex hawaii 1897 japanese government strongly object situation grow tense president dispatch new battleship oregon honolulu secretly order navy seize island japan attempt use force",143,"[1898, 1897, 1890, 1896, 1898, 1880, 1890, 1897]",1893,8,1900,1900
579,"Despite the economic ties and Japanese threats, however, opponents stalled the annexation treaty. They argued it would require an even more expensive navy to protect the territory; that it would be the first step toward colonialism and the destruction of the Constitution (which, they believed, could not easily extend across large expanses of water and over heavily multiracial populations); and that the United States already effectively controlled Hawaii anyway. Opposition was especially strong from antiimmigrant groups in California, sugar-beet interests, and organized labor, which feared an influx of cheap Asian workers. Congress adjourned in 1897 without acting on the pact.23",['1897'],despite economic tie japanese threat opponent stall annexation treaty argue require expensive navy protect territory step colonialism destruction constitution believe easily extend large expanse water heavily multiracial population united state effectively control hawaii opposition especially strong antiimmigrant group california sugar beet interest organize labor fear influx cheap asian worker congress adjourn 1897 act pact.23,54,[1897],1897,1,1900,1900
580,"McKinley resubmitted his proposal to Congress to annex the islands in May 1898. Conditions had transformed. The president demanded Hawaii as a necessary military base en route to Manila and Shanghai. (Opponents argued in vain that the circle route via the Aleutians, not Hawaii, was the shortest path to Chinese ports.) Japan, moreover, was reeling from German and Russian moves in China, and now, with a new, pro-U.S. government, made overtures for cooperation to Washington by withdrawing its objection to annexation. Missionaries, who had initially led the white settlements on Hawaii, demanded annexation so that the islands could become “a base of operations for the enterprise of universal evangelization.” In the House, the tough, antiexpansionist speaker, Thomas B. Reed (R.-Maine), held up debate for three weeks until McKinley threatened to use his war powers to seize Hawaii. The resolution then passed after four days of debate, 209–91. In a free-for-all secret Senate debate, Henry Cabot Lodge charged that other powers in addition to Japan were waiting to seize the islands. He doubtless had Germany in mind. Opponents warned that annexation would open “a second avenue of conquest” for the United States that would lead to “the Philippines next. Part of Asia next. Where will be the limits?” But McKinley had boxed them in. He privately stated his argument succinctly: “We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California. It is manifest destiny.” His resolution received a bare two-thirds vote in the Senate.24","['May 1898', 'three weeks', 'four days']",mckinley resubmitt proposal congress annex island 1898 condition transform president demand hawaii necessary military base en route manila shanghai opponent argue vain circle route aleutian hawaii short path chinese port japan reel german russian move china new pro u.s government overture cooperation washington withdraw objection annexation missionary initially lead white settlement hawaii demand annexation island “ base operation enterprise universal evangelization ” house tough antiexpansionist speaker thomas b. reed r .- maine hold debate week mckinley threaten use war power seize hawaii resolution pass day debate 209–91 free secret senate debate henry cabot lodge charge power addition japan wait seize island doubtless germany mind opponent warn annexation open “ second avenue conquest ” united state lead “ philippine asia limit ” mckinley box privately state argument succinctly “ need hawaii good deal california manifest destiny resolution receive bare third vote senate.24,141,[1898],1898,1,1900,1900
581,"On July 31, 1898, McKinley indeed prepared to take the Philippines next, or at least a strategic part of them. At this point, he seemed unsure whether he would take only the port of Manila, which he and such advisers as Mahan preferred, or whether he would have to take all the Philippines to secure Manila. What was clear was his determination to keep all that his forces had conquered until he made a careful analysis of the overall situation. He had no doubt that he did not want all of Spain’s Pacific and Caribbean possessions, only, as affairs stood at the end of the war, Manila, Cuba, and Puerto Rico; that is, he was determined to control the Caribbean and its entry points to a possible isthmian canal in Central America, and equally committed to possess a major naval base from which he could quickly dispatch troops to fight, if necessary, for an open door to China’s markets.","['July 31, 1898', 'the end of the']",july 31 1898 mckinley prepare philippines strategic point unsure port manila adviser mahan prefer philippine secure manila clear determination force conquer careful analysis overall situation doubt want spain ’s pacific caribbean possession affair stand end war manila cuba puerto rico determine control caribbean entry point possible isthmian canal central america equally committed possess major naval base quickly dispatch troop fight necessary open door china ’s market,66,[1898],1898,1,1900,1900
582,"Cuba had been a prime target of American expansionists since the days of John Quincy Adams. The “apple,” as Adams called it, had now fallen. Ironically, however, U.S. leaders no longer wanted to hold it. Its racial mixture, its advanced independence movement, and attendant constitutional problems in Washington made absorption unappealing. Its ninety-mile proximity to the United States, moreover, seemed to make annexation unnecessary. Control could be exerted more indirectly and cheaply. Certainly McKinley wanted control. As Mahan explained in an 1897 essay, the island’s domination of three of the four main communication routes in the Caribbean, its short interior lines between ports, its long coastline and many harbors that made blockade nearly impossible – these strategic reasons and the $50 million in U.S. investments in the rich sugar and mining businesses made control necessary.25","['the days', '1897']",cuba prime target expansionist day john quincy adams “ apple ” adams call fall ironically u.s leader longer want hold racial mixture advanced independence movement attendant constitutional problem washington absorption unappealing ninety mile proximity united state annexation unnecessary control exert indirectly cheaply certainly mckinley want control mahan explain 1897 essay island ’s domination main communication route caribbean short interior line port long coastline harbor blockade nearly impossible – strategic reason 50 million u.s investment rich sugar mining business control necessary.25,80,[1897],1897,1,1900,1900
583," The problem was how to find the balance between U.S. control and Cuban self-government. “We are dealing with a race that has been steadily going down for a hundred years and into which we have got to infuse new life,” General Leonard Wood, McKinley’s new commander in Cuba, wrote the president. The Cuban army seemed unfit to rule; “A Cuban camp could always be detected by the nose before it came into view,” a disgusted U.S. officer wrote home in mid-1898. Cubans were “very unsatisfactory.” Ragtag, stealing from U.S. messes to survive, the Cubans were shunted aside and humiliated. They nevertheless had weapons, an ideology of independence inherited from Martí, and, after February 1899, the horrifying example (in U.S. eyes) of the Filipinos rebelling against their new American masters. The danger was such that the Cubans were not allowed to participate in the victory parades. Wood advocated solving the dilemma through outright annexation. Then a “stable government” could be installed. By stable, he said, he meant “money at six percent.” James Harrison Wilson, who surfaced in Cuba as another top U.S. military commander, argued for a subtler approach: Create indirect political and economic ties that would, as they had in Hawaii, slowly pull Cuba into the Union.26","['a hundred years', 'mid-1898', 'February 1899']",problem find balance u.s control cuban self government “ deal race steadily go year get infuse new life ” general leonard wood mckinley ’s new commander cuba write president cuban army unfit rule “ cuban camp detect nose come view ” disgusted u.s officer write home mid-1898 cuban “ unsatisfactory ” ragtag steal u.s mess survive cuban shunt aside humiliate weapon ideology independence inherit martí february 1899 horrifying example u.s eye filipinos rebel new master danger cuban allow participate victory parade wood advocate solve dilemma outright annexation “ stable government ” instal stable say mean “ money percent ” james harrison wilson surface cuba u.s military commander argue subtle approach create indirect political economic tie hawaii slowly pull cuba union.26,120,"[1898, 1899]",1898,2,1900,1900

585,"Elihu Root, whom McKinley had enticed from the top of New York’s legal and corporate community to replace the hapless Alger as secretary of war, had to make the choice. No one was better qualified. A gifted administrator, and so well connected that he became the father of the twentieth-century American establishment, Root quickly grasped the reins and cleansed the War Department. He thoroughly reorganized the army by creating the general staff in 1903 and also began the first long-term strategic forecast that included an interservice planning group. Root paid special attention, however, to governing the new conquests, a task he and McKinley assumed was a right of the executive, with minimal congressional contributions. By late 1899 Root had stalled the Cuban independence forces by buying off individual soldiers and promising their leaders a high degree of self-government. He opted for Wilson’s approach: indirect control through economic ties and also through a series of political provisions that included a U.S. naval base at Guantanamo, sanitation policies that would encourage foreign investment, a Cuban debt limit so that European creditors could not gain a foothold, and – of special significance – the right of U.S. intervention to guarantee a republican government.27","['twentieth-century', '1903', 'late 1899']",elihu root mckinley entice new york ’s legal corporate community replace hapless alger secretary war choice better qualified gifted administrator connected father twentieth century establishment root quickly grasp rein cleanse war department thoroughly reorganize army create general staff 1903 begin long term strategic forecast include interservice planning group root pay special attention govern new conquest task mckinley assume right executive minimal congressional contribution late 1899 root stall cuban independence force buy individual soldier promise leader high degree self government opt wilson ’s approach indirect control economic tie series political provision include u.s naval base guantanamo sanitation policy encourage foreign investment cuban debt limit european creditor gain foothold – special significance – right u.s intervention guarantee republican government.27,117,"[1903, 1899]",1901,2,1925,1950
586,"These provisions were written into a U.S.-Cuban treaty by Senator Orville Platt (R.-Conn.). They thus became known, rather misleadingly, as the Platt Amendment, although they were Root’s and Wilson’s ideas. Root’s special touch was to force the Cuban Constitutional Convention to write the Platt Amendment into its governing document in 1900. His task was not easy. He tried to load the convention with pro-U.S. delegates by imposing suffrage requirements of property and literacy. Nationalist elements nevertheless won. When they objected to the Platt Amendment, Wood and Root informed the Cubans that the new nation had no choice but to accept it. After all, Root observed, the United States already had the authority to set Cuba right under the Monroe Doctrine. He now only wanted this authority put into a treaty (and constitution) that would be sanctified by international law. The Cuban Constitutional Convention capitulated by a vote of 16–11, with four abstentions. A key leader, Estrada Palma, gave in with the hope that outright annexation would soon follow. Others came around after Root promised to give them a reciprocity treaty that would guarantee entry to U.S. markets. At first, Root and the new president, Theodore Roosevelt, could not overcome the opposition of beet-sugar interests to such a treaty. In 1903, however, these interests were literally bought out by the American Sugar Refining Company monopoly that had access to Cuban fields. Industrialists and farmers from the United States also supported the treaty because they received preferences in the island’s markets.","['1900', '1903']",provision write u.s .- cuban treaty senator orville platt r .- conn know misleadingly platt amendment root ’s wilson ’s idea root ’s special touch force cuban constitutional convention write platt amendment governing document 1900 task easy try load convention pro u.s delegate impose suffrage requirement property literacy nationalist element win object platt amendment wood root inform cuban new nation choice accept root observe united state authority set cuba right monroe doctrine want authority treaty constitution sanctify international law cuban constitutional convention capitulate vote 16–11 abstention key leader estrada palma give hope outright annexation soon follow come root promise reciprocity treaty guarantee entry u.s market root new president theodore roosevelt overcome opposition beet sugar interest treaty 1903 interest literally buy sugar refining company monopoly access cuban field industrialist farmer united state support treaty receive preference island ’s market,138,"[1900, 1903]",1902,2,1925,1950

Wood wrote privately to Roosevelt in 1900, “There is, of course, little or no independence left Cuba under the Platt Amendment.” As historian Robert Hannigan noted, even the doubling of U.S. investments and new rail lines did not help lead to stability. By 1906 Cuba was again in so much turmoil that U.S. troops landed to restore order.28","['1900', '1906']",united state apparently padlock cuban system politically economically give semblance self government wood write privately roosevelt 1900 “ course little independence leave cuba platt amendment ” historian robert hannigan note doubling u.s investment new rail line help lead stability 1906 cuba turmoil u.s troop land restore order.28,47,"[1900, 1906]",1903,2,1925,1950

589,"In a series of landmark decisions between 1901 and 1910, known as the Insular Cases, the Supreme Court’s majority ruled that the peoples of territories such as Puerto Rico, which had been obtained by conquest, did not have full citizenship rights. They enjoyed only certain “fundamental” rights because they were in an “unincorporated” territory subject to congressional authority. (Puerto Ricans finally received U.S. citizenship in 1917, but nearly a century after the conquest only had commonwealth, and not statehood or independent, status; the decisions resulting from the Insular Cases meanwhile continued to govern U.S. holdings in the Pacific, such as Guam.) As the Supreme Court made African Americans second-class citizens in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), its Insular Cases made Puerto Ricans inferior by conquest. The Court was bitterly divided: Of the ten decisions making up the Insular cases, five were decided by 5–4 votes and featured impassioned dissenting opinions.29","['between 1901 and 1910', '1917', 'nearly a century', '1896']",series landmark decision 1901 1910 know insular case supreme court ’s majority rule people territory puerto rico obtain conquest citizenship right enjoy certain “ fundamental ” right “ unincorporated ” territory subject congressional authority puerto rican finally receive u.s citizenship 1917 nearly century conquest commonwealth statehood independent status decision result insular case continue govern u.s holding pacific guam supreme court african american second class citizen plessy v. ferguson 1896 insular case puerto rican inferior conquest court bitterly divide decision make insular case decide 5–4 vote feature impassioned dissenting opinions.29,89,"[1917, 1896]",1906,2,1925,1950
590,"Again, the pursuit of opportunity drove U.S. policy. On one level, the quest was for full control over strategic naval bases. On another level, it was, as the Foraker Act indicated, for investment opportunities without local restraints. When the U.S. customs duties on Puerto Rican goods disappeared in 1901, the sugar companies, as historian Raymond Carr writes, were “allowed to expand their activities in Puerto Rico whatever the social and human costs.” A future result, he notes, “was economic catastrophe in the 1930s” for the island. More immediate results of Washington’s political and economic policies were chaotic elections (“mob rule” in the 1900 balloting, as Carr describes it) and a full-blown constitutional crisis in 1909 when the nation’s leader, Luis Muñoz Rivera, in the best tradition of 1776, challenged U.S. colonial financial control. President William Howard Taft interpreted the challenge as proof that “we have gone somewhat too fast in the extension of political power to them for their own good”; he and Congress then took further power away from the Puerto Ricans.

591,"The responsibility for maintaining order could have been given fully to Cubans and Puerto Ricans. It was not given, however, again because of the economic, strategic, and racial results of the Second Industrial Revolution. As a direct consequence of this policy of opportunity, Cubans soon vented frustrations over their unbalanced economic development and lack of control over their own political affairs by erupting in civil war and even attempted revolution during the next thirty-five years. The United States responded with military force as early as 1906 and thus only sharpened the imbalances and the Cubans’ charges that it was the United States, not themselves, who prevented the working out of the nation’s problems. For the sake of control and opportunity, the United States became, in both Cuba and Puerto Rico, not the agent of order but the focal point for protest and disorder. For the next two generations, Washington nevertheless refused to reconsider its policies but only tried to protect its economic and strategic opportunities through the sometimes reluctant but continued deployment of military force under the command of the new presidency.32","['the next thirty-five years', 'as early as 1906', 'the next two generations']",responsibility maintain order give fully cuban puerto rican give economic strategic racial result second industrial revolution direct consequence policy opportunity cuban soon vent frustration unbalanced economic development lack control political affair erupt civil war attempt revolution thirty year united state respond military force early 1906 sharpen imbalance cubans’ charge united state prevent work nation ’s problem sake control opportunity united state cuba puerto rico agent order focal point protest disorder generation washington refuse reconsider policy try protect economic strategic opportunity reluctant continue deployment military force command new presidency.32,88,[1906],1906,1,1925,1950
592,"“We are all jingoes now,” the New York Sun wrote immediately after the 1898 war, “and the head jingo is the Hon. William McKinley.” The term “jingo” came from an 1878 British music hall song about “jingo” Englishmen who were aching to fight Russia. The term also came from the Japanese empress, Jingo, who sometime before the fourth century A.D. invaded Korea in an uproar of nationalism, war, and all-out expansionism.1 By the late 1890s it was a household term. Given the lineage, however, McKinley was no “jingo.” He disdained seizing parts of the Spanish empire and approached Cuba, Puerto Rico, and – above all – the Philippines incrementally and with a superb politician’s sensitivity to the need for consensus. His objective was not a colonial empire but the minimum territory needed to obtain an American conquest of world markets, along with the taking of strategic points necessary to protect that conquest. To achieve such a conquest, however, McKinley was willing to endure disorder and bear upheavals, even full-scale insurrection in the Philippines or the extraordinary dangers of becoming involved in war on the Asian mainland.","['now', '1898', '1878', 'the fourth century A.D.', 'the late 1890s', '–']",“ jingo ” new york sun write immediately 1898 war “ head jingo hon william mckinley ” term “ jingo ” come 1878 british music hall song “ jingo ” englishman ache fight russia term come japanese empress jingo fourth century a.d invade korea uproar nationalism war expansionism.1 late 1890s household term give lineage mckinley “ jingo disdain seize part spanish empire approach cuba puerto rico – – philippine incrementally superb politician ’s sensitivity need consensus objective colonial empire minimum territory need obtain conquest world market taking strategic point necessary protect conquest achieve conquest mckinley willing endure disorder bear upheaval scale insurrection philippine extraordinary danger involve war asian mainland,109,"[1898, 1878, 1890]",1889,3,1900,1900
593,"On May 4, 1898, even before he received official word of Admiral George Dewey’s conquest of Manila, the president ordered 5,000 troops to embark for the occupation of the Philippines “and such service as may be ordered hereafter.” These troops quickly encountered the forces of Emilio Aguinaldo, who had led the Filipino independence fight in 1896–7 against Spain. After a brief interlude, the struggle reerupted with such fury in March 1898 (six weeks before U.S. forces appeared) that the U.S. consul told Washington that “insurrection is rampant” and that despite Spanish “barbarity,” the rebels verged on conquering Manila itself. Just twenty-eight years old in 1898, Aguinaldo had been born to a poor farmer and his wife, who was one-half Chinese. He had shown brilliance, ruthlessness, and leadership, as well as an ardent nationalism. In late May 1898, Admiral Dewey reported that Aguinaldo’s forces were able to render valuable military services. Within a month, however, as McKinley’s determination to seize Luzon and Manila hardened, U.S. officials in the islands were instructed to have nothing to do with any of Aguinaldo’s “political claims.” His forces had now grown to 37,000 troops. By midsummer, as the Filipino noted that Americans were not preparing to leave despite the end of the war, tension heightened. McKinley had walked into a trap. He ordered Dewey to make no deals with Aguinaldo, but the rebel seemed to need none. By July his forces practically controlled the most strategic island, Luzon (which is nearly as large as New York State), except for Manila; were spreading their authority over other islands; and had conquered large elements of Spain’s army.2","['May 4, 1898', '1896–7', 'March 1898', 'six weeks', 'Just twenty-eight years old', '1898', 'late May 1898', 'a month', 'midsummer', 'the end of the', 'July']","4 1898 receive official word admiral george dewey ’s conquest manila president order 5,000 troop embark occupation philippine “ service order ” troop quickly encounter force emilio aguinaldo lead filipino independence fight 1896–7 spain brief interlude struggle reerupt fury march 1898 week u.s force appear u.s consul tell washington “ insurrection rampant ” despite spanish “ barbarity ” rebel verge conquer manila year old 1898 aguinaldo bear poor farmer wife half chinese show brilliance ruthlessness leadership ardent nationalism late 1898 admiral dewey report aguinaldo ’s force able render valuable military service month mckinley ’s determination seize luzon manila harden u.s official island instruct aguinaldo ’s “ political claim force grow 37,000 troop midsummer filipino note american prepare leave despite end war tension heighten mckinley walk trap order dewey deal aguinaldo rebel need july force practically control strategic island luzon nearly large new york state manila spread authority island conquer large element spain ’s army.2",154,"[1898, 1896, 1898, 1898, 1898]",1898,5,1900,1900
594,"McKinley nevertheless decided to try to hold all the Philippines until he could figure out exactly which spoils of war U.S. interests required. The touchstone was Asian trade. Acting Secretary of State William R. Day and Massachusetts Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge penned memorandums in June 1898 (after, it might be noted, conversations with each other). Day assumed that the recent industrial surpluses required “an enlargement of foreign markets,” especially in China, where European colonization threatened American interests. Lodge’s memorandum, written to Day on June 6, 1898, seemed to borrow heavily from Lodge’s close friend, Brooks Adams, who had developed a historical theory that world power followed the center of money exchanges. Those centers, Adams argued, had moved constantly westward, and now the United States was in a position to seize world economic power from Great Britain if Americans could dominate Asia, the largest and cheapest of all markets. If, Lodge warned, Europeans instead divided China and “we fail to establish ourselves with a large port and with territory in the East,” catastrophe loomed: “We must have new markets unless we would be visited by declines in wages and by great industrial disturbances, of which signs have not been lacking. The old theory of competing in foreign markets merely by the price of the product is no longer practicable.” Now “a navy, coaling stations and ports in the East … have become essential conditions in our time.” Lodge urged that, at a minimum, Luzon be U.S.-controlled.3","['June 1898', 'June 6, 1898']",mckinley decide try hold philippine figure exactly spoil war u.s interest require touchstone asian trade act secretary state william r. day massachusetts republican senator henry cabot lodge pen memorandum june 1898 note conversation day assume recent industrial surplus require “ enlargement foreign market ” especially china european colonization threaten interest lodge ’s memorandum write day june 6 1898 borrow heavily lodge ’s close friend brooks adams develop historical theory world power follow center money exchange center adam argue move constantly westward united state position seize world economic power great britain american dominate asia large cheap market lodge warn europeans instead divide china “ fail establish large port territory east ” catastrophe loom “ new market visit decline wage great industrial disturbance sign lack old theory compete foreign market merely price product longer practicable ” “ navy coaling station port east … essential condition time ” lodge urge minimum luzon u.s .- controlled.3,152,"[1898, 1898]",1898,2,1900,1900
595,"McKinley’s thoughts clearly had been running along the same lines, as had those of many others, including John Hay, whom the president had ordered to return from London in mid-1898 to become secretary of state. To ensure his freedom of action and to pull off a political coup that set an important historical precedent, McKinley named a five-man peace commission that not only had a majority of expansionists but also included key senators who would later have to vote on their own handiwork. Senators Cushman Davis (R.-Minn.) and William Frye (R.-Maine) were imperialists; Senator George Gray (D.-Del.) was an avowed (but as McKinley understood, a malleable) antiexpansionist. Day, who headed the commission, was not considered an imperialist, but he did want Manila, although little else of the Philippines. Above all, however, Day would do whatever his longtime Ohio friend, the president, asked him to do, as would the fifth member, Whitelaw Reid, owner of the powerful Republican newspaper the New York Tribune. On October 28,1898, McKinley finally ordered them to demand all of the Philippines. In return the United States would pay $20 million for recent improvements Spain had made in the islands.","['mid-1898', 'Day', 'October 28,1898']","mckinley ’s thought clearly run line include john hay president order return london mid-1898 secretary state ensure freedom action pull political coup set important historical precedent mckinley name man peace commission majority expansionist include key senator later vote handiwork senator cushman davis r .- minn william frye r .- maine imperialist senator george gray d .- del avowed mckinley understand malleable antiexpansionist day head commission consider imperialist want manila little philippine day longtime ohio friend president ask fifth member whitelaw reid owner powerful republican newspaper new york tribune october 28,1898 mckinley finally order demand philippine return united state pay 20 million recent improvement spain island",105,"[1898, 1898]",1898,2,1900,1900
596,"As early as August, McKinley had ordered “no joint occupation with the insurgents,” only unilateral U.S. control. Meanwhile he kept a careful eye on European powers that coveted the islands, and the Japanese, who subtly sounded out the State Department about a cooperative role “in the interest of commerce and peace.” McKinley wanted no part of a policy that would give advantages to his chief competitors. In the autumn he undertook a political swing through the American heartland. Ostensibly it was to sound out public opinion while stumping for Republican candidates in the 1898 congressional campaign. In reality, he had already decided to take the islands. His speeches were structured not to consult but to arouse the opinion to fulfill “the responsibility that has been put upon us by the results of the war,” as he declared in one speech. McKinley returned to Washington to report, not surprisingly, that the people agreed that the United States had a mission in Asia.4","['August', 'autumn', '1898']",early august mckinley order “ joint occupation insurgent ” unilateral u.s control keep careful eye european power covet island japanese subtly sound state department cooperative role “ interest commerce peace ” mckinley want policy advantage chief competitor autumn undertake political swing heartland ostensibly sound public opinion stump republican candidate 1898 congressional campaign reality decide island speech structure consult arouse opinion fulfill “ responsibility result war ” declare speech mckinley return washington report surprisingly people agree united state mission asia.4,79,[1898],1898,1,1900,1900
597," As the president reached this momentous conclusion, one development was of special importance: Based on the evidence he had at hand, McKinley would have had difficulty arguing that Americans needed to annex Luzon for the purpose of restoring order. Aguinaldo had apparently already begun to accomplish that objective. The U.S. consul general in Hong Kong, who was in close contact with Aguinaldo, told Washington this in mid-July 1898:",['mid-July 1898'],president reach momentous conclusion development special importance base evidence hand mckinley difficulty argue american need annex luzon purpose restore order aguinaldo apparently begin accomplish objective u.s consul general hong kong close contact aguinaldo tell washington mid july 1898,38,[1898],1898,1,1900,1900
598,"The diplomat stressed that the Filipino leader “had taken up the reins of the Spanish government and controlled the island of Luzon outside of Manila; had complete telegraphic communications with the chieftains of the provinces … and established a revolutionary government which was apparently acceptable to the Filipinos of the Island.” In the crucial province of Batangas, south of Manila, for example, Aguinaldo’s decrees governed by June and would continue to do so – with the help of upper-class Filipinos – until U.S. troops finally invaded to destroy his government in early 1900.5","['June', 'early 1900.5']",diplomat stress filipino leader “ take rein spanish government control island luzon outside manila complete telegraphic communication chieftain province … establish revolutionary government apparently acceptable filipino island ” crucial province batangas south manila example aguinaldo ’s decree govern june continue – help upper class filipino – u.s troop finally invade destroy government early 1900.5,54,[1900],1900,1,1925,1950
599,"Aguinaldo’s forces and U.S. troops exchanged gunfire on February 6, 1899, and the islands exploded in revolution against McKinley’s policy. Who fired the first shot remains difficult to determine, although there is no doubt that on the president’s orders U.S. troops were moving into several port cities held by the Filipinos and assuming the powers of government. Until the exchange of gunfire, some close observers doubted whether the Senate would ratify the peace treaty. One of these observers was Andrew Carnegie, who so hated the thought that Americans were following in the footsteps of his despised British imperialists that he wrote highly insulting letters to his friend in the White House (“Your friend personally, but the bitterest enemy you have officially,” one read). The steel magnate even offered to buy the islands for $20 million so that he could restore their independence. Other critics warned that McKinley’s colonial policy would undermine the Constitution. Most of these critics, however, wanted to exploit Asian trade and somehow neutralize the Philippines so that they could be used (in the phrase of antiimperialist Edward Atkinson) as a “sanctuary of commerce.”7","['February 6, 1899']",aguinaldo ’s force u.s troop exchange gunfire february 6 1899 island explode revolution mckinley ’s policy fire shot remain difficult determine doubt president ’s order u.s troop move port city hold filipinos assume power government exchange gunfire close observer doubt senate ratify peace treaty observer andrew carnegie hat thought american follow footstep despised british imperialist write highly insult letter friend white house “ friend personally bitter enemy officially ” read steel magnate offer buy island 20 million restore independence critic warn mckinley ’s colonial policy undermine constitution critic want exploit asian trade neutralize philippine phrase antiimperialist edward atkinson “ sanctuary commerce.”7,101,[1899],1899,1,1900,1900
600,"If the annexationists had the best of the economic and constitutional debates, however, both sides could equally exploit the explosive racial issue. Roosevelt and Beveridge used the idea of Anglo-Saxon racial superiority to justify keeping the Philippines, while Senator John Daniel (D.-Va.) warned that if the islands were taken, the conquering nation would no longer be known as the United States of America but would descend to the depths of “The United States of America and Asia,” as Americans and Filipinos would become “one flesh.” As African Americans (including some who had served in the 1898 war) were lynched, burned, or otherwise oppressed in the United States, McKinley and other officials did nothing. A few antiimperialists, such as the articulate Boston lawyer Moorfield Storey, condemned the policy in the Philippines and began to see that African Americans were treated similarly, if not worse, at home; these opponents of the treaty consequently started to champion African American rights. Storey was appalled when Elihu Root declared that the failed policy of giving African Americans the vote in the United States proved that the Filipinos could not be trusted with it. Most antiimperialists, however, were much less concerned about the treatment of African Americans than they were with the treatment of Filipinos. The racial question, as they saw it, had so torn up three hundred years of American history that they did not want to compound the tragedy by adding in the Filipinos. One interesting variation of the opponents’ view came from the American Federation of Labor, which argued that “trade unions are possible only in industrial and in civilized countries.” Because the Philippines did not qualify, Americans would have to build a costly army and navy to enforce imperialism.","['1898', 'three hundred years']",annexationist good economic constitutional debate side equally exploit explosive racial issue roosevelt beveridge idea anglo saxon racial superiority justify keep philippine senator john daniel d .- va warn island take conquer nation longer know united state america descend depth “ united state america asia ” american filipinos “ flesh ” african american include serve 1898 war lynch burn oppress united state mckinley official antiimperialist articulate boston lawyer moorfield storey condemn policy philippine begin african american treat similarly bad home opponent treaty consequently start champion african right storey appal elihu root declare fail policy give african american vote united state prove filipinos trust antiimperialist concerned treatment african american treatment filipino racial question see tear year history want compound tragedy add filipinos interesting variation opponents’ view come federation labor argue “ trade union possible industrial civilized country ” philippine qualify american build costly army navy enforce imperialism,145,[1898],1898,1,1900,1900
601,"Another, more significant variation appeared in June 1898, when the Anti-Imperialist League formed in Boston. More than half the membership was made up of women. Throughout most of the nineteenth century, women’s organizations had shown little interest in foreign policy, but led by suffrage groups, they changed their focus after the 1870s. Many women openly identified with Filipinos who were also to be governed without their consent, and women’s groups consequently played important roles in the intense foreign policy debates between 1898 and 1905. Imperialists, however, assumed that if the U.S. government had shown it could keep African Americans and Indians (and women) in their place at home without the vote, it could do the same with Filipinos.9","['June 1898', 'the nineteenth century', 'the 1870s', 'between 1898 and 1905']",significant variation appear june 1898 anti imperialist league form boston half membership woman nineteenth century woman ’s organization show little interest foreign policy lead suffrage group change focus 1870s woman openly identify filipinos govern consent woman ’s group consequently play important role intense foreign policy debate 1898 1905 imperialist assume u.s government show african american indians woman place home vote filipinos.9,61,"[1898, 1870]",1884,2,1900,1900
602,"The debate, accelerated by the peace treaty signed with Spain December 10, 1898, and sent to the Senate January 4, 1899, raged on, with the opponents believing they were gaining strength – until the night of February 4. McKinley then received news that the insurgents had attacked U.S. forces in Manila. He must not have been surprised. As early as October 1898, he had been warned by his consul general, Rounsevelle Wildman, that there was no good reason for war with Aguinaldo, but “the way we are going on now [in pushing aside the Filipinos], it seems to me we may drift into a miserable war that would be as unnecessary as it would be disastrous.” McKinley nevertheless stayed the course and war had erupted. “How foolish these people [the Filipinos] are,” the president observed after receiving the February 4 cable. “This means the ratification of the treaty.”","['December 10, 1898', 'January 4, 1899', 'October 1898', 'February 4']",debate accelerate peace treaty sign spain december 10 1898 send senate january 4 1899 rag opponent believe gain strength – night february 4 mckinley receive news insurgent attack u.s force manila surprise early october 1898 warn consul general rounsevelle wildman good reason war aguinaldo “ way go push aside filipinos drift miserable war unnecessary disastrous ” mckinley stay course war erupt “ foolish people filipinos ” president observe receive february 4 cable “ mean ratification treaty,76,"[1898, 1899, 1898]",1898,3,1900,1900

The outbreak of war, McKinley’s use of patronage and presidential authority, and the Republican dominance in the Senate decided the issue. Less important was William Jennings Bryan’s last-minute conversion to supporting the treaty on the ostensible (and puzzling) grounds that the war had to be ended first before he could wage political war on McKinley about the treaty and the issue of imperialism in the 1900 presidential campaign. Bryan could not decisively turn many Senate votes; Lodge, Mark Hanna, and the powerful Rhode Island Senator Nelson Aldrich could and did. McKinley and the Republican leadership threw a sop to the opposition, and covered their political flanks, by passing the McEnery Resolution, which promised that in an unspecified “due time” the Philippines would receive independence.10","['February 6', '1900']",february 6 pact pass partisan line bare third require 57–27 40 republican 10 democrat 2 populist 4 silverite 1 independent 21 democrat oppose 3 republican 2 populist 1 silverite outbreak war mckinley ’s use patronage presidential authority republican dominance senate decide issue important william jennings bryan ’s minute conversion support treaty ostensible puzzling ground war end wage political war mckinley treaty issue imperialism 1900 presidential campaign bryan decisively turn senate vote lodge mark hanna powerful rhode island senator nelson aldrich mckinley republican leadership throw sop opposition cover political flank pass mcenery resolution promise unspecified “ time ” philippine receive independence.10,100,[1900],1900,1,1925,1950
604,"Deeply embittered, Carnegie denied that the war had “entrusted to us” the Philippines, as McKinley claimed. “This is the President’s own Pandora box,” Carnegie charged, and it was entirely his doing. More accurate was the Philadelphia Press’s prescient assessment in late June 1898. Its editorial, “The Inevitable Expansion,” argued that the “first cause” in obtaining a Philippine foothold had not been the war but the soaring export of manufactures from $150 million to nearly $300 million in only five years. “The time has come for the United States to look out and not in…. These things are inevitable. They have not been caused by the Spanish war and its close will not change them. They create new responsibilities, and the United States must meet them.”11 To meet such responsibilities, McKinley sought what he termed “benevolent assimilation.” He instead received a three-year war.","['late June 1898', 'only five years', 'three-year']",deeply embittered carnegie deny war “ entrust ” philippine mckinley claim “ president ’s pandora box ” carnegie charge entirely accurate philadelphia press ’s prescient assessment late june 1898 editorial “ inevitable expansion ” argue “ because ” obtain philippine foothold war soar export manufacture 150 million nearly 300 million year “ time come united state look … thing inevitable cause spanish war close change create new responsibility united state meet them.”11 meet responsibility mckinley seek term “ benevolent assimilation ” instead receive year war,85,[1898],1898,1,1900,1900
605,"American power was focused, however, on the Philippines and the Asian mainland. When Aguinaldo’s troops refused to obey, McKinley did not hesitate to escalate U.S. troops’ presence in the islands until they numbered more than 30,000 at one time and totaled 120,000 during the three-year conflict. They faced 80,000 Filipino troops. For all of his messages to Congress and Methodist church leaders about ideals, McKinley used the new U.S. military power created by the Second Industrial Revolution and used it decisively, without visible qualms, and as forcefully as required.13 On only the first day of fighting, three thousand Filipinos were killed. Nearly two thousand Americans died in the war, fifteen hundred more than the number who died in combat in the 1898 war, but McKinley never seriously considered pulling back, striking a compromise with Aguinaldo, or allowing the Philippine leader to reclaim the control of his people that the U.S. consul believed he had demonstrated through much of 1898. Meanwhile, at least two hundred thousand Filipinos perished in the struggle.","['three-year', 'only the first day', '1898', '1898']","power focus philippine asian mainland aguinaldo ’s troop refuse obey mckinley hesitate escalate u.s troops’ presence island number 30,000 time total 120,000 year conflict face 80,000 filipino troop message congress methodist church leader ideal mckinley new u.s military power create second industrial revolution decisively visible qualm forcefully required.13 day fighting thousand filipinos kill nearly thousand american die war number die combat 1898 war mckinley seriously consider pull strike compromise aguinaldo allow philippine leader reclaim control people u.s consul believe demonstrate 1898 thousand filipinos perish struggle",85,"[1898, 1898]",1898,2,1900,1900
606,"McKinley’s objectives, he declared in mid-1899, were fourfold: “Peace first, then a government of law and order honestly administered, full security to life, property, and occupation under the Stars and Stripes.” As the fighting escalated, however, brutalities on both sides intensified and casualties mounted. U.S. troops used methods of torture, including the “water cure,” in which a Filipino was questioned while pails of filthy water were slowly poured into his mouth. One marching song even urged U.S. troops to view such torture as part of being patriotic Americans who were carrying out “the battle cry of freedom.” The president found himself fighting a bloody conflict, with no end in sight, just as the 1900 presidential election began to be discussed.","['mid-1899', '1900']",mckinley ’s objective declare mid-1899 fourfold “ peace government law order honestly administer security life property occupation star stripe ” fighting escalate brutality side intensify casualty mount u.s troop method torture include “ water cure ” filipino question pail filthy water slowly pour mouth marching song urge u.s troop view torture patriotic american carry “ battle cry freedom ” president find fight bloody conflict end sight 1900 presidential election begin discuss,71,"[1899, 1900]",1900,2,1925,1950

Of the thirty generals who served in the war between 1898 and 1902, twenty-six, or 87 percent, had dealt with the Indians. Three of the remaining four were from the West. Moreover, the best people in the Philippines seemed to be on the American side. “Leading Filipinos express confidence in early pacification of the islands,” General Elwell Otis cabled home in May 1900. Those “leading Filipinos” mostly lived in upper-class Manila neighborhoods. With a fear of Aguinaldo based on class hatred, they had earlier given McKinley bad advice about “Philippine views” and helped the president miscalculate throughout 1898.14","['the 1865 to 1890 years', 'between 1898 and 1902', 'twenty-six', 'May 1900']",superb military force officer promote success hunt indian 1865 1890 year thirty general serve war 1898 1902 87 percent deal indians remain west good people philippine “ lead filipinos express confidence early pacification island ” general elwell otis cable home 1900 “ lead filipino ” live upper class manila neighborhood fear aguinaldo base class hatred earlier give mckinley bad advice “ philippine view ” help president miscalculate 1898.14,68,[1900],1900,1,1925,1950
608,"McKinley also tried to create the proper record, and gain public support, by appointing a special commission in January 1899 (just before the Senate vote on the peace treaty) to investigate the Philippine crisis. It was headed by Cornell University president Jacob Gould Schurman, who was publicly known as an antiexpansionist; however, McKinley privately knew (because of a Schurman letter to the president) that he ardently believed that the conquest of China’s trade was “undoubtedly our most important foreign question at the present time.” The president again carefully screened the Schurman Commission’s work, but he need not have worried. To the surprise of many, the commission urged the retention of the Philippines until, as Schurman phrased it, the Filipinos could exercise “the rights and duties of independent sovereignty.” After all, as he wrote to a friend in 1900, “the effect of our tenure of the Philippine Islands has, in my judgment, been the improvement of trade opportunities in the Orient” – although the “sole aim” in both the Philippines and Puerto Rico, Schurman immediately added, “must be the welfare of the natives.” Secretary of State Hay sympathized with Schurman: “It is heart breaking to see how much punishment those misguided Filipinos insist on, but it must go on until they learn the things that belong to their peace. Then will come the time for you to put forth the bases of an orderly and beneficent government for them.”16","['January 1899', '1900']",mckinley try create proper record gain public support appoint special commission january 1899 senate vote peace treaty investigate philippine crisis head cornell university president jacob gould schurman publicly know antiexpansionist mckinley privately know schurman letter president ardently believe conquest china ’s trade “ undoubtedly important foreign question present time ” president carefully screen schurman commission ’s work need worry surprise commission urge retention philippine schurman phrase filipinos exercise “ right duty independent sovereignty ” write friend 1900 “ effect tenure philippine island judgment improvement trade opportunity orient ” – “ sole aim ” philippine puerto rico schurman immediately add “ welfare native ” secretary state hay sympathize schurman “ heart break punishment misguided filipinos insist learn thing belong peace come time forth base orderly beneficent government them.”16,127,"[1899, 1900]",1900,2,1925,1950

The fighting, however, never stopped. American troops continued to war on other islands, especially between 1902 and 1910, and, in the case of the Moros on Mindanao, until 1935. After that confrontation, Washington officials allowed the U.S.-trained Philippine Constabulary to try to eradicate the revolt. The Constabulary failed. As a high-ranking U.S. army officer wrote home in 1909, long after the revolution had supposedly ended, “We have established civil government, so called, but everybody carries arms on all occasions, even when bathing in the sea…. The civil government is a farce to placate sentiment in the states and could not last a minute without military force.”17","['March 1901', '1901', 'that year', '1991', 'between 1902 and 1910', '1935', '1909']",march 1901 u.s officer discover aguinaldo ’s mountain hideout native troop track troop nearly perish starvation aguinaldo send food u.s mission shoot filipino guard capture leader fighting die 1901 year united state move great naval base subic bay exception 1942–4 remain 1991 fighting stop troop continue war island especially 1902 1910 case moro mindanao 1935 confrontation washington official allow u.s .- train philippine constabulary try eradicate revolt constabulary fail high rank u.s army officer write home 1909 long revolution supposedly end “ establish civil government call everybody carry arm occasion bath sea … civil government farce placate sentiment state minute military force.”17,102,"[1901, 1901, 1991, 1935, 1909]",1927,5,1950,1950
610,"The disorder and bloodshed continued for many reasons. The United States refused to leave; instead, under the 1901 commission headed by William Howard Taft, it established a government controlled by Americans. After 1905, the executive power was in the hands of a governor-general appointed by the president of the United States. The only Filipinos included were from the upper classes. In 1906, the first provincial leaders were allowed to participate. Many formed a party that demanded immediate independence. These leaders, in turn, were opposed by more radical guerrillas, who, in fighting U.S. control, carried on the many wars in the hundreds of outlying islands. Economically, Washington imposed land and tariff measures that replicated the unequal distribution of property that had been established under Spanish rule. Huge chunks of the best land fell into American hands. The U.S. sugar trust bought eighty thousand acres in 1910, and Taft himself had earlier invested in a promising holding. In all, the United States had celebrated a victory in 1901; in 1906, the Chicago American even linked the national pastime to the national policies by claiming that baseball’s individualism was “one of the reasons why American soldiers are the best in the world [and] capable of going into action without officers.”18 But the war raged on.","['1901', '1905', '1906', '1910', '1901', '1906']",disorder bloodshed continue reason united state refuse leave instead 1901 commission head william howard taft establish government control american 1905 executive power hand governor general appoint president united state filipinos include upper class 1906 provincial leader allow participate form party demand immediate independence leader turn oppose radical guerrilla fight u.s control carry war hundred outlying island economically washington impose land tariff measure replicate unequal distribution property establish spanish rule huge chunk good land fall hand u.s sugar trust buy eighty thousand acre 1910 taft early invest promising holding united state celebrate victory 1901 1906 chicago link national pastime national policy claim baseball ’s individualism “ reason soldier good world capable go action officers.”18 war rag,115,"[1901, 1905, 1906, 1910, 1901, 1906]",1905,6,1925,1950

Or, if some U.S. diplomatic dispatches were to be believed, the military could not reimpose order. The Filipinos, according to American consul generals, had been on their way to creating their own order in 1898. McKinley’s interests turned elsewhere; he searched for an answer to what Schurman called “our most important foreign question,” that is, finding opportunities in Asia.

612,"During his early 1898 run-up to the war with Spain, McKinley linked the crises in the Caribbean and Asian theaters. As revolution threatened Cuba, so European imperialism endangered China. The U.S. business community tried to keep Asia in the forefront of the nation’s debate. Exports of cotton cloth to China more than doubled to $7 million in a single year, the New York Commercial Advertiser reported in January 1898. “The Orient is just beginning to be a purchaser in our markets for things which every civilized nation has always bought to its capacity.” Thus it was imperative to “retain free entry into the China market…. It must be clearly understood that while armed Europe is welcome to steal Chinese territory …, we cannot submit to being excluded from trade in that territory.” Other observers noted that kerosene exports to China had reached $4.5 million, and the market seemed unlimited, as it did for exports of flour, iron, and steel. A metaphor for post–Civil War U.S. industrial development was the Cordova, Alabama, cotton mills, whose twenty-five thousand spindles were built by Boston capital and whose entire product in 1897 went to China.19","['early 1898', 'a single year', 'January 1898', '–', '1897']",early 1898 run war spain mckinley link crisis caribbean asian theater revolution threaten cuba european imperialism endanger china u.s business community try asia forefront nation ’s debate export cotton cloth china double 7 million single year new york commercial advertiser report january 1898 “ orient begin purchaser market thing civilized nation buy capacity ” imperative “ retain free entry china market … clearly understand armed europe welcome steal chinese territory … submit exclude trade territory ” observer note kerosene export china reach 4.5 million market unlimited export flour iron steel metaphor post – civil war u.s industrial development cordova alabama cotton mill thousand spindle build boston capital entire product 1897 go china.19,112,"[1898, 1898, 1897]",1898,3,1900,1900
613,"As John Hay returned home from London in late summer 1898, he was, as McKinley knew, fully conversant with the threats that endangered America’s Open Door to China. He also had learned firsthand that all of Europe seemed about to explode because of imperial rivalries. The British Empire in Africa was being undermined by costly wars in Khartoum, South Africa, and by the crisis between British and French forces, which met on the upper Nile at Fashoda in 1898. The growing confrontation in Asia was part of these global rivalries. Besieged abroad by German, French, and Russian militarism and by American and German marketplace triumphs, Great Britain followed a policy of appeasement not only toward the United States but, to McKinley’s and Hay’s horror, toward the Russians, when the two European nations agreed in April 1898 to stake out zones in China for railroad monopolies. The Russians seemed to be closing off their Manchurian ports. The Open Door was imperiled.

In “The Spanish War and the Equilibrium of the World,” Adams used trade figures and money-flow statistics to demonstrate that the 1898 war marked the point at which the world’s money centers since 1815 – London and Paris – were shifting either east to Berlin and St. Petersburg, or west to New York. The great question would finally be decided by which side controlled Asian markets. It would be a battle “between the maritime and unmaritime races.” Adams demanded an Anglo-American alliance to push back the “unmaritime” Russians and Germans; otherwise, the inability to get rid of U.S. surplus goods would “run the risk of [American] suffocation.” If, on the other hand, the alliance worked,","['August 1898', '1898', '1815 –']",gigantic stake issue outline hay ’s roosevelt ’s close friend brooks adams august 1898 issue forum “ spanish war equilibrium world ” adam trade figure money flow statistic demonstrate 1898 war mark point world ’s money center 1815 – london paris – shift east berlin st petersburg west new york great question finally decide control asian market battle “ maritime unmaritime race ” adam demand anglo alliance push “ unmaritime ” russian germans inability rid u.s surplus good “ run risk suffocation ” hand alliance work,86,"[1898, 1898, 1815]",1870,3,1875,1900

Authorities ranging from Mahan to the Germanophile U.S. ambassador to Berlin, Andrew Dickson White, warned, in White’s words, that by the 1898 war, “German feeling toward us had become generally adverse and, in some parts of the empire, bitterly hostile.” A clash impended. Germany could be friendly when Americans were preoccupied with settling a continent, wrote an 1897 North American Review essayist, but with “a reinforced Monroe Doctrine, great navy,” and U.S. interests clashing with Germany’s at pivotal parts of the globe, the relationship had necessarily changed. In reality, the German threat, at least in the Caribbean-northern Latin American region, was overrated by Washington officials. Berlin policymakers held other regions, including China, as considerably more important than the Western Hemisphere. In that area, as historian Nancy Mitchell concludes in a definitive study on the subject, “There was no German threat.”21","['1898', '1897']",germany appear especially threaten u.s officials’ eye replace great britain major danger u.s interest caribbean southwest pacific authority range mahan germanophile u.s ambassador berlin andrew dickson white warn white ’s word 1898 war “ german feeling generally adverse part empire bitterly hostile ” clash impend germany friendly american preoccupy settle continent write 1897 north review essayist reinforce monroe doctrine great navy ” u.s interest clash germany ’s pivotal part globe relationship necessarily change reality german threat caribbean northern latin region overrate washington official berlin policymaker hold region include china considerably important western hemisphere area historian nancy mitchell conclude definitive study subject “ german threat.”21,104,"[1898, 1897]",1898,2,1900,1900
616,"Most of all, however, Hay and other U.S. officials carefully watched the course of Russian power. Once informally allied with Americans, the St. Petersburg government had alienated U.S. opinion when, after the 1881 assassination of Tsar Alexander II, it reversed many of Alexander’s reforms to crack down on internal dissent. Anti-Semitic policies accelerated; these included the arrest of Jews who had been born in Russia and then returned as agents of U.S. corporations. Singer Sewing Machine and McCormick Harvester, both of which had political influence in Washington, especially suffered from these arrests, and U.S. officials threatened to abrogate the 1832 treaty of commerce and navigation unless Russia changed its policies. At the same time, the historic movement of Slavic peoples across Russia and into Siberia (as many as four million moved between 1880 and 1900), and the building of the Trans-Siberian Railway, with its rich contracts for U.S. steel and locomotive builders, offered a chance to repair the frayed relationship. Tsar Nicholas II, however, threatened to destroy this chance by using the railway as part of a power grab in Manchuria. Such a policy seemed to be made more imperative by an economic depression that struck Russia in mid-1899 and remained for nearly a half-dozen years.","['1881', '1832', 'between 1880 and', '1900', 'mid-1899']",hay u.s official carefully watch course russian power informally ally american st petersburg government alienate u.s opinion 1881 assassination tsar alexander ii reverse alexander ’s reform crack internal dissent anti semitic policy accelerate include arrest jews bear russia return agent u.s corporation singer sewing machine mccormick harvester political influence washington especially suffer arrest u.s official threaten abrogate 1832 treaty commerce navigation russia change policy time historic movement slavic people russia siberia million move 1880 1900 building trans siberian railway rich contract u.s steel locomotive builder offer chance repair frayed relationship tsar nicholas ii threaten destroy chance railway power grab manchuria policy imperative economic depression strike russia mid-1899 remain nearly half dozen year,112,"[1881, 1832, 1880, 1900, 1899]",1878,5,1900,1900
617,"Against this background the tsar called for the first Hague Conference to discuss arms limitation and the peaceful settlement of disputes. The United States attended, but Mahan, as one of the U.S. delegates, led the successful fight against any American agreement to obligatory arbitration. Washington’s vital interests were better decided by force, he argued, than by submitting them to the tender mercies of non-American judges. Also against this background, U.S. analysts and officials concluded by 1899–1900 that Russia posed the greatest danger to an open, rather than a colonized, Asian marketplace and that it was the United States, rather than an overextended Great Britain, that would have to blunt that danger. The great struggle, wrote a scholarly essayist in late 1898, was between “Slav and Saxon,” with the Americans and British having to unite “against the advance of the Russian Macedon.” One of the few prominent voices who disagreed was that of Henry Adams, Brooks’s brother and an intimate of Hay’s. “If Russia breaks down now,” Henry wrote the secretary of state in 1900, “I’m not dead certain but that the whole flowery menagerie might break loose.”22","['late 1898', '1900']",background tsar call hague conference discuss arm limitation peaceful settlement dispute united state attend mahan u.s delegate lead successful fight agreement obligatory arbitration washington ’s vital interest better decide force argue submit tender mercy non judge background u.s analyst official conclude 1899–1900 russia pose great danger open colonize asian marketplace united state overextended great britain blunt danger great struggle write scholarly essayist late 1898 “ slav saxon ” american british have unite “ advance russian macedon ” prominent voice disagree henry adams brooks ’s brother intimate hay ’s “ russia break ” henry write secretary state 1900 “ be dead certain flowery menagerie break loose.”22,105,"[1898, 1900]",1899,2,1900,1900
618,"Hay and McKinley chose Brooks’s analysis over Henry’s warning. The Chinese marketplace had to be saved by explicit agreement, or the Open Door principle – which Hay defined as “a fair field and no favor” – could be obliterated. The growing trade, especially in manufactured goods (which now accounted for up to 90 percent of U.S. exports to China), gave point to the belief that although the trade accounted for only 1 percent of overall U.S. commerce, its rise from $7 million of exports in 1896 to $12 million in 1897 and $14 million in 1899 portended rich future profits. Only a few, such as Worthington C. Ford, former head of the Treasury Department’s Bureau of Statistics, disagreed. China was so poor, Ford argued, that it could never become a great U.S. market. And God forbid that China would industrialize and develop, he implied, because with its cheap labor it could undersell the West everywhere.","['1896', '1897', '1899']",hay mckinley choose brook ’s analysis henry ’s warning chinese marketplace save explicit agreement open door principle – hay define “ fair field favor ” – obliterate grow trade especially manufacture good account 90 percent u.s export china give point belief trade account 1 percent overall u.s commerce rise 7 million export 1896 12 million 1897 14 million 1899 portend rich future profit worthington c. ford head treasury department ’s bureau statistic disagree china poor ford argue great u.s market god forbid china industrialize develop imply cheap labor undersell west,90,"[1896, 1897, 1899]",1897,3,1900,1900
619,"Hay could not take the chance that Ford might be right. Domestic political and economic demands, and the growing doubts about the ability of the British to maintain the Open Door on their own, were too pressing. In 1899, Hay issued the first set of Open Door notes asking that the powers not violate existing interests inside leased territories they acquired, that they not discriminate against other nations in setting port and railway rates, and that the Chinese tariff duties apply within each new sphere of interest. No one was pleased with Hay’s initiative outside Washington, not even the British, who had hoped that he would instead ally himself directly with them against the other Europeans. London, however, realizing this was the best it could obtain, finally went along, then the Japanese agreed, and, finally and with great reluctance, the Germans, Russians, and French signed up.23",['1899'],hay chance ford right domestic political economic demand grow doubt ability british maintain open door press 1899 hay issue set open door note ask power violate exist interest inside lease territory acquire discriminate nation set port railway rate chinese tariff duty apply new sphere interest pleased hay ’s initiative outside washington british hop instead ally directly europeans london realize good obtain finally go japanese agree finally great reluctance german russian french sign up.23,73,[1899],1899,1,1900,1900
620,"Hardly had Hay settled back to enjoy his apparent triumph than the Boxers United in Righteousness stormed toward the Chinese capital of Peking, leaving dead Christians and destroyed Western property in their wake. The Boxer uprising of 1898 to 1900 was one in a series of internal upheavals dating from the eighteenth century that aimed at overthrowing the Qing dynasty. The immediate triggers for the Boxers were the 1897–8 German grab of Shantung, the Russian movement into Manchuria, the new French claims in the south bordering Indochina, and the British taking of Weihaiwei Harbor on the Shantung Peninsula to offset the German conquest. Of special note, the Filipino uprising against the United States indicated to some Chinese nationalists that the Filipinos were “pioneers of independence for Asia.” McKinley’s decision to take over the Philippines was having considerable, even revolutionary, repercussions.","['1898', 'the eighteenth century', 'the Qing dynasty']",hardly hay settle enjoy apparent triumph boxer unite righteousness storm chinese capital peking leave dead christian destroy western property wake boxer uprising 1898 1900 series internal upheaval date eighteenth century aim overthrow qing dynasty immediate trigger boxer 1897–8 german grab shantung russian movement manchuria new french claim south border indochina british taking weihaiwei harbor shantung peninsula offset german conquest special note filipino uprising united state indicate chinese nationalist filipinos “ pioneer independence asia ” mckinley ’s decision philippines have considerable revolutionary repercussion,82,[1898],1898,1,1900,1900
621,"Chinese nationalism accelerated just as the United States became heavily involved in the Boxer Rebellion. Recruiting peasants and playing on growing antiforeign feelings, the Boxers targeted Christian missionaries and their relatively few Chinese converts. Women, led by the Red Lanterns Shining group, became key members of the Boxers. By 1900, the rebels were in Peking, killing not only converts but also French and Belgian engineers and leading U.S. missionaries. When the Western powers tried to send in more troops to protect their legation compounds, the Boxers were able to stop them. After the German minister was killed in June 1900, the empress dowager of China rallied to the Boxers’ side and declared war herself against the foreigners. As the terror spread, foreigners in Peking were besieged. Some 20,000 troops from Japan, France, Great Britain, Russia, and the United States finally reached the capital in August 1900 and lifted the siege. McKinley notably used his new base, Manila, to send 5,000 troops into the battle.24","['1900', 'June 1900', 'August 1900']","chinese nationalism accelerate united state heavily involved boxer rebellion recruit peasant play grow antiforeign feeling boxer target christian missionary relatively chinese convert woman lead red lantern shin group key member boxer 1900 rebel peking kill convert french belgian engineer lead u.s missionary western power try send troop protect legation compound boxer able stop german minister kill june 1900 empress dowager china rally boxers’ declare war foreigner terror spread foreigner peking besiege 20,000 troop japan france great britain russia united state finally reach capital august 1900 lift siege mckinley notably new base manila send 5,000 troop battle.24",96,"[1900, 1900, 1900]",1900,3,1925,1950

He asked the powers directly to declare that they supported China’s “territorial and administrative integrity.” They finally did so declare, but not until a crisis in August–September 1900 forced McKinley to assume that the tsar would keep troops in Peking until the weakened dowager empress would give him all Russia wanted in Manchuria, and perhaps in other parts of China as well. The Russians especially were holding on to the Manchurian port of New-Chwang, an act Hay privately called “bold robbery.”","['six months old', 'July 3', 'August–September 1900']",question foreign army quickly disintegrate china “ open door hinge month old ” henry adams tease hay “ kind door rig ” july 3 hay try rehinge policy issue second open door note ask power directly declare support china ’s “ territorial administrative integrity ” finally declare crisis august – september 1900 force mckinley assume tsar troop peking weakened dowager empress russia want manchuria part china russian especially hold manchurian port new chwang act hay privately call “ bold robbery,80,[1900],1900,1,1925,1950
623,"Immersed in a bitter reelection campaign against William Jennings Bryan, who was making much of McKinley’s wars for imperialism in the Philippines and China, the president actually considered, for a moment in September 1900, either pulling out of China or joining in the rush for Chinese ports and territory. Either way, the Open Door principles would disappear into history. Secretary of War Elihu Root argued that the U.S. troop withdrawal would protect Americans against becoming “but a chip floating on the surface of the currents of intrigue and aggression of other Powers” and keep “us out of complications which might discredit our policy among our own people” – a powerful argument for McKinley at that point in the presidential campaign.25",['September 1900'],immerse bitter reelection campaign william jennings bryan make mckinley ’s war imperialism philippines china president actually consider moment september 1900 pull china join rush chinese port territory way open door principle disappear history secretary war elihu root argue u.s troop withdrawal protect american “ chip float surface current intrigue aggression power “ complication discredit policy people ” – powerful argument mckinley point presidential campaign.25,64,[1900],1900,1,1925,1950
624," Hay, however, supported by Mahan and the leading U.S. diplomatic authority on China, William C. Rockhill, turned McKinley back around. Faced with the defeat of his own, Seward’s, and indeed a half-century of U.S. diplomacy in China, and writing from a sickbed in New Hampshire, the secretary of state argued that the Open Door required that U.S. troops remain until all the foreign powers backed down from their demands. In an historic letter penned for McKinley’s eyes, Hay wrote on September 14, 1900: ","['a half-century', 'September 14, 1900']",hay support mahan lead u.s diplomatic authority china william c. rockhill turn mckinley face defeat seward ’s half century u.s diplomacy china write sickbed new hampshire secretary state argue open door require u.s troop remain foreign power back demand historic letter pen mckinley ’s eye hay write september 14 1900,50,[1900],1900,1,1925,1950
625,"In 1901, the powers finally retreated from the capital, as they reluctantly pledged allegiance to Open Door principles. But they simultaneously extracted the huge indemnity of $333 million from China for the Boxers’ massacres and destruction of property. Rockhill led the drive to reduce the indemnity; he knew it could further weaken China and serve as leverage for more foreign demands. Unsuccessful in this attempt, in 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt pledged to return part of Washington’s share to the Chinese for use in sending their students to U.S. schools. (TR’s decision was not philanthropic. He sought to achieve specific goals: calm violent anti-American feelings being fanned by Chinese nationalism over U.S. exclusion acts; try to loosen Japan’s stranglehold on educating young Chinese who studied abroad; and teach the younger generation about American virtues and economics. “A Chinese who acquires his education in this country,” a State Department official announced, “goes back predisposed toward America and American goods.”)26","['1901', '1907']",1901 power finally retreat capital reluctantly pledge allegiance open door principle simultaneously extract huge indemnity 333 million china boxers’ massacre destruction property rockhill lead drive reduce indemnity know weaken china serve leverage foreign demand unsuccessful attempt 1907 president theodore roosevelt pledge return washington ’s share chinese use send student u.s school tr ’s decision philanthropic seek achieve specific goal calm violent anti feeling fan chinese nationalism u.s exclusion act try loosen japan ’s stranglehold educate young chinese study abroad teach young generation virtue economic “ chinese acquire education country ” state department official announce “ go predispose america goods.”)26,99,"[1901, 1907]",1904,2,1925,1950
626,"To maintain access to those Open Door opportunities, moreover, McKinley took a historic step in creating a new, twentieth-century presidential power. He dispatched 5,000 troops to the Chinese mainland without consulting Congress, let alone obtaining a declaration of war, to fight the Boxers, who were supported by the Chinese government. That government even declared war against the United States, although the president and Congress did not bother to notice the declaration. Presidents had previously used such force against nongovernmental groups that threatened U.S. interests and citizens. It was now used, however, against recognized governments, and without obeying the Constitution’s provisions about who was to declare war. After the 1898 conflict, England’s Spectator (as duly noted by McKinley’s private secretary, George Cortelyou) wrote that the Civil War and the 1898 war had shown that the presidency had become “neither more nor less than elective monarchy, limited as to duration, and regulated as to finance, but otherwise nearly unfettered…. The formless people when excited always hunger for a leader, and they get one.” In the China crisis, the elective monarchy’s power further expanded.27","['twentieth-century', '1898', '1898']","maintain access open door opportunity mckinley take historic step create new twentieth century presidential power dispatch 5,000 troop chinese mainland consult congress let obtain declaration war fight boxer support chinese government government declare war united state president congress bother notice declaration president previously force nongovernmental group threaten u.s interest citizen recognize government obey constitution ’s provision declare war 1898 conflict england ’s spectator duly note mckinley ’s private secretary george cortelyou write civil war 1898 war show presidency “ elective monarchy limit duration regulate finance nearly unfettered … formless people excite hunger leader ” china crisis elective monarchy ’s power expanded.27",101,"[1898, 1898]",1898,2,1900,1900

628,"The election fourteen months later, observers generally agreed, would determine whether Americans wanted to carry the burdens of such power. By May 1900 the president believed imperialism was to be “the paramount and dominating issue in the campaign,” as Schurman paraphrased McKinley. His major opposition came from Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan, who was backed not only by Bryan’s traditional pro-silver allies but also by the money and political power of the antiimperialist groups of Boston, Chicago, Indianapolis, and other major cities, most of them east of the Mississippi. Andrew Carnegie’s millions funded antiimperialist attacks on McKinley.","['fourteen months later', 'May 1900']",election fourteen month later observer generally agree determine american want carry burden power 1900 president believe imperialism “ paramount dominate issue campaign ” schurman paraphrase mckinley major opposition come democratic nominee william jennings bryan back bryan ’s traditional pro silver ally money political power antiimperialist group boston chicago indianapolis major city east mississippi andrew carnegie ’s million fund antiimperialist attack mckinley,61,[1900],1900,1,1925,1950
629,"It was, however, a strange romance. Carnegie detested Bryan’s appeal to class and devotion to free silver. The nominee flatly refused the steelmaker’s plea to make foreign policy the single issue of the campaign. Carnegie even tried to buy a third party into existence, but failed. Bryan gave him hope with an acceptance speech in 1900 that indeed did single out imperialism as the issue, and the Democratic party platform blasted as well British imperialism (especially in South Africa), but when the campaign began, Bryan continued to discuss the silver and trust issues. Former House Speaker Thomas B. Reed (R.-Maine) said, laughing, “Bryan had rather be wrong than President.” The silver issue had been settled by the inflow of the yellow metal since 1896 and the Gold Standard Act. The trust issue was an ineffective attempt to exploit class differences by pointing to the growing number of corporate trusts the Republicans allowed to form after 1897. Even on the imperialist issue, however, Democrats, led by Bryan, blurred the choices by pledging to give the Filipinos better government, not promising immediate independence, and swearing to uphold vital U.S. interests in the Far East.

630,"McKinley exploited these contradictions in Bryan’s appeal, changed the terms of the debate by defining imperialism as an honorable American tradition, and carried out a foreign policy in late 1900 that forced Bryan to drop the imperialism issue. The President then swamped the Nebraskan in the balloting. McKinley’s most dramatic move was to name the loudest of all imperialists, Governor Theodore Roosevelt of New York, as his vice-presidential nominee. Roosevelt went on such a rousing cross-country tour that he finally lost his voice. He even went to Bryan’s home state of Nebraska and delivered forty speeches in four days. The message was always much the same: Bryan’s political patron, Jefferson, had been one of the first great imperialists; the United States was governing the Philippines in the American tradition and in the natives’ best interests, which might not be what “the inhabitants at the moment prefer”; force was necessary because “the barbarians … yield” only to power; and if whites were “morally bound to abandon the Philippines, we were also morally bound to abandon Arizona to the Apaches” – a reference that again tied together the expansion of the pre–Civil War era with that of the 1890s. As for the vaunted constitutional principles, “Bryan cannot be acquitted of hypocrisy when he prattles about the ‘consent of the governed,’ in the Philippines,” Roosevelt wrote, “and profits by the denial of this same so-called right in [the Democratic party–controlled states of] North Carolina and Alabama.”31","['late 1900', 'four days', 'the pre–', 'the 1890s', '–']","mckinley exploit contradiction bryan ’s appeal change term debate define imperialism honorable tradition carry foreign policy late 1900 force bryan drop imperialism issue president swamp nebraskan balloting mckinley ’s dramatic loud imperialist governor theodore roosevelt new york vice presidential nominee roosevelt go rousing cross country tour finally lose voice go bryan ’s home state nebraska deliver speech day message bryan ’s political patron jefferson great imperialist united state govern philippine tradition natives’ good interest “ inhabitant moment prefer ” force necessary “ barbarian … yield ” power white “ morally bind abandon philippine morally bind abandon arizona apache ” – reference tie expansion pre – civil war era 1890s vaunted constitutional principle “ bryan acquit hypocrisy prattle ‘ consent governed,’ philippine ” roosevelt write “ profit denial call right democratic party – control state north carolina alabama.”31",137,"[1900, 1890]",1895,2,1900,1900
631,"The U.S. domination of foreign peoples, in any event, was only incidental to realizing America’s commercial and cultural destinies. While the British seized 4.7 million square miles of territory between 1870 and 1900, and Germany 1 million, the United States needed only 125,000. As McKinley blurred the issues and protected Americans in Peking, Carnegie surrendered. The steel baron came out against Bryan and the Democrat’s demands for silver and an income tax. Other Republicans, who disliked McKinley’s policies, despised Bryan more and showed, as one newspaper said of former President Benjamin Harrison, “brilliant flashes of silence.” Winning the largest plurality of votes until that time in a presidential election, McKinley also garnered 21 more electoral votes (292 to 155) than he had obtained in 1896. He and Roosevelt even won Bryan’s home state of Nebraska.32","['between 1870 and 1900', '1896']","u.s domination foreign people event incidental realize america ’s commercial cultural destiny british seize 4.7 million square mile territory 1870 1900 germany 1 million united state need 125,000 mckinley blur issue protect american peking carnegie surrender steel baron come bryan democrat ’s demand silver income tax republican dislike mckinley ’s policy despise bryan show newspaper say president benjamin harrison “ brilliant flash silence ” win large plurality vote time presidential election mckinley garner 21 electoral vote 292 155 obtain 1896 roosevelt win bryan ’s home state nebraska.32",87,[1896],1896,1,1900,1900
632,"The 1900 election was less than a mandate on imperialism because by October Bryan had concluded it was a losing issue for him. He consequently downplayed it and began emphasizing the trust question. Hanna and McKinley were delighted; they knew that in the middle of the new prosperity few Americans were concerned about trusts. Bryan had so muddled his campaign that, except for the woebegone silver issue, many did not understand what he did espouse. “Mr. Dooley” suggested that the Democrats run an advertisement: “Wanted: a good, active, inergetic dimmycrat … must be in favor iv sound money, but not too sound, an’ anti-impeerylist but f’r holdin’ onto what we’ve got, an inimy iv thrusts but a frind iv organized capital.”33","['1900', 'October']",1900 election mandate imperialism october bryan conclude losing issue consequently downplay begin emphasize trust question hanna mckinley delighted know middle new prosperity american concern trust bryan muddle campaign woebegone silver issue understand espouse “ mr dooley ” suggest democrats run advertisement “ want good active inergetic dimmycrat … favor iv sound money sound an’ anti impeerylist f’r holdin’ have get inimy iv thrust frind iv organize capital.”33,67,[1900],1900,1,1925,1950
633,"McKinley was not ambiguous. In the draft for his speech at Berkeley, California, in May 1901, he demanded that the nation produce more educated people “with technical and scientific knowledge” to run America’s Second Industrial Revolution, because “industry has become a science.” And because Americans had “passed beyond the period of exclusion and isolation the mastery of languages is an essential qualification to the pioneer of new markets…. The superficial student is less in demand than he ever was.” Four months later, he told those attending the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo that the nation’s “almost appalling wealth” dictated that “isolation is no longer possible or desirable.” The president passionately pleaded for a broader reciprocity trade policy before American surpluses suffocated the system. He ended the speech with a demand for a modern merchant marine, a Pacific cable, and an isthmian canal.34","['May 1901', 'Four months later']",mckinley ambiguous draft speech berkeley california 1901 demand nation produce educated people “ technical scientific knowledge ” run america ’s second industrial revolution “ industry science ” american “ pass period exclusion isolation mastery language essential qualification pioneer new market … superficial student demand ” month later tell attend pan exposition buffalo nation ’ “ appalling wealth ” dictate “ isolation longer possible desirable ” president passionately plead broad reciprocity trade policy surplus suffocate system end speech demand modern merchant marine pacific cable isthmian canal.34,85,[1901],1901,1,1925,1950
634,"Distinguished scholarly work on Theodore Roosevelt has concluded that his conservatism, moralism, and keen sense of balance-of-power international politics are the keys to understanding this highly popular and influential president. On the centennial of his birth, he was celebrated with a Time magazine cover story in March 1958, at the nadir of the Cold War. Time applauded his use of “a new kind of power – deterrence” to “promote the U.S. self-interest in … world order.” One biographer notes that “a deep-seated conservatism formed his basic political outlook.” Another concludes that “he believed in change, but gradual change; change within established institutions.” A third argues that it was not TR’s blustering and quick use of force that marked his diplomacy as much as careful balance-of-power calculations. A fourth, taking a cultural approach, believes that “TR’s willingness to use civilization as a political guideline marked him as a major figure in the rise of American internationalism,” and his view of “civilization,” which belonged to a simpler past, made him “the last traditional American statesman.” One of the first analysts of his statecraft, Alfred L. P. Denis, who remains one of the best, observed that “his apparent impulsiveness … obscured in some ways the essentially conservative quality of his statesmanship.”1","['the centennial', 'March 1958']",distinguished scholarly work theodore roosevelt conclude conservatism moralism keen sense balance power international politic key understanding highly popular influential president centennial birth celebrate time magazine cover story march 1958 nadir cold war time applaud use “ new kind power – deterrence ” “ promote u.s self interest … world order ” biographer note deep seated conservatism form basic political outlook ” conclude “ believe change gradual change change established institution ” argue tr ’s blustering quick use force mark diplomacy careful balance power calculation fourth take cultural approach believe “ tr ’s willingness use civilization political guideline mark major figure rise internationalism ” view “ civilization ” belong simple past “ traditional statesman ” analyst statecraft alfred l. p. denis remain good observe apparent impulsiveness … obscure way essentially conservative quality statesmanship.”1,132,[1958],1958,1,1975,2000
635,"If these arguments are correct, two questions arise: Why did TR’s conservative diplomacy time and again result in upheaval, imbalance, and even revolution, and why did he interpret his presidential powers in foreign affairs so radically that he would probably have upset his great conservative hero, Alexander Hamilton? If the argument, as some advance it, is that the context of his time drove this conservative to extremes, then that context has to be carefully and fully developed. For a central irony of modern American diplomatic history is that between the 1890s and World War I, the United States became a great world power – that is, one of the three or four most powerful nations, and thus a supposed supporter of the status quo and the maintenance of a favorable balance of power – at the very time that important parts of the world exploded into revolution. Roosevelt and the United States certainly did not cause this revolutionary outbreak, but in certain cases – for example, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Mexico in 1911–13 – the American role was notable and in several instances determinative. In nearly every case, however, Roosevelt’s policies worsened, rather than made more orderly, the conditions that triggered the upheaval.","['1890s', '1911–13 –']",argument correct question arise tr ’s conservative diplomacy time result upheaval imbalance revolution interpret presidential power foreign affair radically probably upset great conservative hero alexander hamilton argument advance context time drive conservative extreme context carefully fully develop central irony modern diplomatic history 1890s world war united state great world power – powerful nation suppose supporter status quo maintenance favorable balance power – time important part world explode revolution roosevelt united state certainly because revolutionary outbreak certain case – example panama dominican republic mexico 1911–13 – role notable instance determinative nearly case roosevelt ’s policy worsen orderly condition trigger upheaval,99,"[1890, 1911]",1900,2,1925,1950
636,"Progressives, such as those with whom Roosevelt identified, might have sought order and their parochial definition of “civilization” as a priority at home, but it was not their first priority abroad. In every instance, Progressive diplomacy first aimed at the creation of opportunity (as in Panama and the Russo-Japanese War) or the maintenance and expansion of opportunity (as in the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Mexico). They were driven not in the first instance by the quest for a more democratic stability, as were some Progressives at home, but by a search for markets, the perceived need for strategic outposts, and a racism that emerged naturally from their history while blending with, and complementing, their overseas imperialism. When this search resulted in upheaval, Roosevelt, resembling William McKinley before him and William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson later, used military force to try to repair the damage, or to ensure – if U.S. interests were already paramount (as in Cuba) – that American interests remained paramount. As commander in chief of this force, the president was in a position to make immense claims for his authority, claims that (as Wilson himself noted in a series of lectures in 1908) created a new presidency that had little relation to that of the nineteenth-century chief executive, and even less to the office visualized in the eighteenth-century Constitution. Without meaning to do so, but because of his reading of American history and his myopic nationalism, the supposedly conservative Roosevelt played a role in creating a revolutionary, war-wracked world, instead of creating a balance-of-power complex that maintained a healthy, gradually evolving international system.","['–', '1908', 'nineteenth-century', 'the eighteenth-century Constitution']",progressive roosevelt identify seek order parochial definition “ civilization ” priority home priority abroad instance progressive diplomacy aim creation opportunity panama russo japanese war maintenance expansion opportunity dominican republic cuba mexico drive instance quest democratic stability progressive home search market perceive need strategic outpost racism emerge naturally history blend complement overseas imperialism search result upheaval roosevelt resemble william mckinley william howard taft woodrow wilson later military force try repair damage ensure – u.s interest paramount cuba – interest remain paramount commander chief force president position immense claim authority claim wilson note series lecture 1908 create new presidency little relation nineteenth century chief executive office visualize eighteenth century constitution mean reading history myopic nationalism supposedly conservative roosevelt play role create revolutionary war wrack world instead create balance power complex maintain healthy gradually evolve international system,134,[1908],1908,1,1925,1950

639,"Between 1897 and 1904, New York moved further out of control. In the ten years before 1904, an average of 301 firms annually disappeared into mergers. Between 1898 and 1902, however, mergers reached numbers never topped in American history: In 1899 alone, 1,028 companies disappeared. In 1897 the worth of firms merging into great companies amounted to $1 billion; in 1903 it was $7 billion. During this era of mergers the corporation assumed a new form. U.S. Steel, formed by J. P. Morgan on the foundation of Andrew Carnegie’s plant, absorbed 138 other companies. International Harvester (formerly McCormick) controlled 85 percent of the harvesting-machine market; American Can Corporation sold nine of every ten cans used in the country; and American Sugar Refining (one of the greatest of all trusts) controlled about 98 percent of the nation’s sugar market. Tens of dozens of railways in the 1880s had been combined into six giant transportation networks by Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, E. H. Harriman, and a few others. These men were not railway (or steel) entrepreneurs. They were capitalists who used their power as investment bankers to reorganize the nation’s corporate system, make it more efficient and monopolistic, and gain great personal profit. By 1904, 78 corporations controlled more than 50 percent of the production in their particular industry. Twenty-eight firms controlled more than 80 percent of their industry’s production. New companies continued to appear, many others went bankrupt, and even some of the richest investors wilted under the strain, but Americans had never remotely seen such consolidation of production and capital in their history.3","['Between 1897 and 1904', 'the ten years before 1904', 'Between 1898 and 1902', '1899', '1897', '1903', 'this era', 'the 1880s', '1904']","1897 1904 new york move control year 1904 average 301 firm annually disappear merger 1898 1902 merger reach number top history 1899 1,028 company disappear 1897 worth firm merge great company amount 1 billion 1903 7 billion era merger corporation assume new form u.s steel form j. p. morgan foundation andrew carnegie ’s plant absorb 138 company international harvester mccormick control 85 percent harvesting machine market corporation sell can country sugar refining great trust control 98 percent nation ’s sugar market ten dozen railway 1880s combine giant transportation network morgan john d. rockefeller e. h. harriman man railway steel entrepreneur capitalist power investment banker reorganize nation ’s corporate system efficient monopolistic gain great personal profit 1904 78 corporation control 50 percent production particular industry firm control 80 percent industry ’s production new company continue appear go bankrupt rich investor wilt strain american remotely see consolidation production capital history.3",148,"[1904, 1899, 1897, 1903, 1880, 1904]",1898,6,1900,1900
640,"A number of causes could be identified. The survivors of the post-1873 depression years (led by Carnegie and Rockefeller) had found the business methods necessary to “run hard,” as Carnegie phrased it, and nevertheless sell the resulting glut of goods at a profit. Many came together to try to avoid further traumas by monopolizing markets to the greatest possible extent. Most of all, however, the merger movement was driven by new technology (the changes from steam to electricity, iron to steel alloys, telegraphs to telephones, simple machines to dynamos and internal combustion engines) that required much capital to develop, as well as large markets in which to sell profitably. The markets, as the most successful entrepreneurs had long since demonstrated, had to be international. This realization led to other kinds of cooperative ventures, such as U.S. Steel’s attempts to divide the world steel-rail market with its European and American competitors. The monopoly capital that reorganized the economic bases of American society also used its profits to invest abroad after 1897, although about half of those investments remained in the Caribbean – South American arena.4","['post-1873', '1897']",number cause identify survivor post-1873 depression year lead carnegie rockefeller find business method necessary “ run hard ” carnegie phrase sell result glut good profit come try avoid trauma monopolize market great possible extent merger movement drive new technology change steam electricity iron steel alloy telegraphs telephone simple machine dynamo internal combustion engine require capital develop large market sell profitably market successful entrepreneur long demonstrate international realization lead kind cooperative venture u.s steel ’s attempt divide world steel rail market european competitor monopoly capital reorganize economic base society profit invest abroad 1897 half investment remain caribbean – south arena.4,99,"[1873, 1897]",1885,2,1900,1900
641,"Roosevelt was president at the peak of the merger movement. His policies, as opposed often to his rhetoric, demonstrated little recognition that this mutation of the Second Industrial Revolution had far-reaching significance for domestic politics. As many scholars have shown, his fame as a trustbuster far outran his actual accomplishments, especially when compared with Taft’s presidency, which in four years initiated about twice as many antitrust suits as were started during Roosevelt’s seven White House years. Profoundly careful in this regard during the first six of those years, TR either built on McKinley’s already established policies in regard to the Caribbean, the Asian balance of power, and the expansion of presidential authority, or he refused to deal with central issues that McKinley had tackled head-on – most notably, the need for new tariff policies. “Thank God I am not a free-trader,” TR wrote his close friend Henry Cabot Lodge in 1895. “Pernicious indulgence in the doctrine of free trade seems inevitably to produce fatty degeneration of the moral fibre.”5","['four years', 'seven White House years', 'the first six of those years', '–', '1895']",roosevelt president peak merger movement policy oppose rhetoric demonstrate little recognition mutation second industrial revolution far reach significance domestic politic scholar show fame trustbuster far outran actual accomplishment especially compare taft ’s presidency year initiate twice antitrust suit start roosevelt ’s seven white house year profoundly careful regard year tr build mckinley ’s establish policy regard caribbean asian balance power expansion presidential authority refuse deal central issue mckinley tackle head – notably need new tariff policy “ thank god free trader ” tr write close friend henry cabot lodge 1895 “ pernicious indulgence doctrine free trade inevitably produce fatty degeneration moral fibre.”5,102,[1895],1895,1,1900,1900
642,"As New York governor in 1899, Roosevelt believed that because “we have … tremendous problems in the way of the relations of labor and capital to solve,” it was necessary “to pay far more attention to this than to any question of expansion for the next fifty years.” He added he believed this “although I am an expansionist.”6 Like the American tory he was, Roosevelt sought to use government means, not least the tariff and his White House “bully pulpit,” to carry out enough gradual reform to ensure political peace, bridge the growing gap between classes, and link those objectives to his foreign policies. Hannah Arendt’s famous dictum that “the alliance between capital and mob is to be found at the genesis of every consistently imperialist policy” is too overstated to fit Roosevelt’s policies well. Nevertheless, as a self-described longtime member of the nation’s governing class, he understood that foreign policy could provide both the bread and the circuses needed to maintain political calm.","['1899', 'the next fifty years']",new york governor 1899 roosevelt believe “ … tremendous problem way relation labor capital solve ” necessary “ pay far attention question expansion year ” add believe “ expansionist.”6 like tory roosevelt seek use government mean tariff white house “ bully pulpit ” carry gradual reform ensure political peace bridge grow gap class link objective foreign policy hannah arendt ’s famous dictum “ alliance capital mob find genesis consistently imperialist policy ” overstate fit roosevelt ’s policy self describe longtime member nation ’s governing class understand foreign policy provide bread circus need maintain political calm,95,[1899],1899,1,1900,1900
643,"His good friend Brooks Adams (whom he invited at times to stay in the White House) explained the dynamic interrelation of domestic and foreign policy directly to Roosevelt. In 1901, Adams argued that the high tariff could be kept only if Americans built a great military force that could defend and expand U.S. interests in the inevitable commercial battles that were looming over Asian and Latin American markets. “In a word,” Adams wrote the president on July 17, 1903, “to live this country must keep open the highways leading west, at equitable rates, and must command the terminus in Asia – and if we fail in this we shall break down.” (At another point, Adams cried; “We must have a new deal…, and have a centralized administration, or we shall wobble over.”) Roosevelt was quite taken with the letter. He replied the next day, “It is necessary for us to keep the road of trade to the East open. In order to insure our having terminals we must do our best to prevent the shutting to us of the Asian markets. In order to keep the roads to these terminals open we must see that they are managed primarily in the interest of the country, that is of the commerce of the country.”","['1901', 'July 17, 1903']",good friend brook adam invite time stay white house explain dynamic interrelation domestic foreign policy directly roosevelt 1901 adam argue high tariff keep american build great military force defend expand u.s interest inevitable commercial battle loom asian latin market “ word ” adams write president july 17 1903 “ live country open highway lead west equitable rate command terminus asia – fail shall break point adam cry “ new deal … centralize administration shall wobble ” roosevelt take letter reply day “ necessary road trade east open order insure have terminal good prevent shutting asian market order road terminal open manage primarily interest country commerce country,106,"[1901, 1903]",1902,2,1925,1950
644,"Roosevelt consequently saw Great Britain as a natural ally. Common racial destinies seemed to have swept aside, finally, the two nations’ differences in the New World and aligned them, along the Open Door principles, against Russia and Germany in Asia. He and his secretary of state, John Hay, were dismayed when the British suffered losses in their war against the South African Boers. The debacle only proved to TR that “England is on the downgrade” and that Americans were becoming dominant in the Anglo-Saxon partnership. He and Hay hoped that their heartfelt support for Britain’s travails would lead London to espouse the Open Door for U.S. goods in South Africa, but after peace was restored, the door effectively shut. The British were more cooperative, however, on the issue of a disputed slice of territory between Alaska and Canada that became valuable when gold was discovered in the region after 1896. When TR sent troops to enforce his claims, an arbitration panel of three U.S. and three British “jurists” was created to settle the increasingly dangerous dispute. The president named not jurists but politicians who shared his view. In 1903, the chief British judge voted with them, more for the sake of Anglo-American harmony than for equity. Much to the Canadians’ fury and disgust, their territorial claim was sacrificed to London’s new appeasement policy.","['1896', '1903']",roosevelt consequently see great britain natural ally common racial destiny sweep aside finally nations’ difference new world align open door principle russia germany asia secretary state john hay dismay british suffer loss war south african boer debacle prove tr “ england downgrade ” american dominant anglo saxon partnership hay hop heartfelt support britain ’s travail lead london espouse open door u.s good south africa peace restore door effectively shut british cooperative issue dispute slice territory alaska canada valuable gold discover region 1896 tr send troop enforce claim arbitration panel u.s british “ jurist ” create settle increasingly dangerous dispute president name jurist politician share view 1903 chief british judge vote sake anglo harmony equity canadians’ fury disgust territorial claim sacrifice london ’s new appeasement policy,125,"[1896, 1903]",1900,2,1925,1950

When the White House (the term itself came into common use during his presidency) was refurbished in 1902, he ensured the building of a room for the press. He tried to manipulate journalists until some refused to talk with him unless a friend came along to witness. His outspoken views and colorful language were hidden from the public to some extent. Edith Wharton concluded that such secrecy by the press proved how “he was loved and respected.” (Even this sophisticated novelist was taken aback, however, when she heard the president say at a large luncheon party, “If only we could revive the good old Roman customs. I know a bath in Senator _____ ’s blood would set me right in no time.”) The press’s self-censorship perhaps also came from fear. Roosevelt unsuccessfully once tried to quiet a critical publisher by twisting a law so that it could serve to jail the man under federal criminal libel statutes.

The pact finally abrogated the 1850 Clayton-Bulwer Treaty and gave the United States the sole right to build and control – but not fortify – a canal linking the Atlantic and the Pacific. To Hay’s amazement, the Senate refused to ratify on the grounds that the United States had to have the right to fortify a canal. Roosevelt, then governor of New York, helped lead the criticism of Hay’s handiwork, and Henry Cabot Lodge headed the Senate attack on the treaty because of his own intense nationalism and sense that Great Britain was vulnerable. Above all, however, Lodge and other Republicans involved in the 1900 election campaign were not going to be accused of being soft on the British. The wounded secretary of state offered to resign, but McKinley would not hear of it. He instead ordered Hay to obtain the rights to fortify.

648,"As Roosevelt assumed power, he was fully conversant with the need for a canal, not least because his good friend Alfred Thayer Mahan had been drumming into him the passageway’s commercial and strategic importance. The question became whether the canal’s location would be in Nicaragua, as recommended by commissions since the 1870s because of its low cost and relative lack of engineering problems, or in Panama, where some rights were held by a French company that had become the descendent of de Lesseps’s failed attempt to build a canal in the 1880s. The company was under the control of two powerful, if devious, figures: Philippe Bunau-Varilla and Wall Street lawyer William Cromwell. In 1902, these two men helped reverse long-standing U.S. policy and lobbied through the Senate the Spooner Amendment (named after Senator John Spooner, R.-Wis.), which gave the president the power to pay $40 million to the French company and purchase canal rights from Colombia, which claimed Panama as its province.

These interventions climaxed on November 2 and 3, 1903, when Roosevelt dispatched a small fleet of warships to Panama to prevent Colombia from putting down the revolt. He clearly violated the 1846 pact that assumed Colombian sovereignty in the region. No matter; Hay quickly negotiated with Bunau-Varilla (not with Panamanians) an amazing treaty that gave the United States “titular sovereignty” (as Hay later called it) in a ten-mile-wide strip that cut the new nation in half. Panama received $10 million plus $250,000 annually for the rights.

Senate Democrats tried to block the treaty just as the 1904 presidential election campaign appeared on the horizon. Terming the opponents a “small body of shrill eunuchs” who represented only effete Northeast mugwumps, Roosevelt blasted back and pushed the treaty through the Senate in early 1904 after a hard fight.

Between 1898 and 1920 U.S. marines entered Caribbean countries no fewer than twenty times. The new canal’s security was only one of many reasons for the interventions. Some two years before the Canal Zone was obtained, Roosevelt declared in his 1901 annual message that such interventionism among “barbarous and semi-barbarous peoples” was “a most regrettable but necessary international police duty which must be performed for the sake of the welfare of mankind.” Privately, however, he hoped both North Americans and Europeans would restrain themselves. Nevertheless, “if any South American State misbehaves toward any European country, let the European country spank it.” He further apparently limited U.S. power by telling the German ambassador and close friend, Speck von Steraburg, in late 1901, “I regard the Monroe Doctrine as being the equivalent to an open door in South America.” By mid-1903, moreover, TR wrote a friend that the Monroe Doctrine’s proper sphere was limited to the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and both entrances to a canal.14","['the nineteenth century', '1898', 'Between 1898 and 1920', 'Some two years', '1901', 'mid-1903']",united state repeatedly dispatch warship land military force caribbean – central region nineteenth century 1898 pace quicken 1898 1920 u.s marine enter caribbean country few time new canal ’s security reason intervention year canal zone obtain roosevelt declare 1901 annual message interventionism “ barbarous semi barbarous people ” “ regrettable necessary international police duty perform sake welfare mankind ” privately hop north american europeans restrain “ south state misbehave european country let european country spank ” apparently limit u.s power tell german ambassador close friend speck von steraburg late 1901 “ regard monroe doctrine equivalent open door south america ” mid-1903 tr write friend monroe doctrine ’s proper sphere limit gulf mexico caribbean entrance canal.14,115,"[1898, 1901, 1903]",1901,3,1925,1950

Indeed, they had been landed with the approval of both the government and the rebels trying to overturn it. In the many-mirrored illusion of Cuban self-government, the United States appeared as both a protector of the government and an advocate for the rebels.

Both were being destabilized, the first by the replacement of tobacco culture by cocoa, and the second by a large influx of U.S. and Cuban capital, which developed sugar plantations but drove peasants off the land and caused food shortages by replacing staple foods, such as beans, with sugar for export. The sugar elite became a driving force for demanding the use of U.S. troops to maintain order – that is, for the preservation of its new economic power.

The new North American investments, and not European threats, initially created the conditions for U.S. intervention. The $20 million of U.S. investments, about one-third in sugar, finally prompted European investors, led by German and French interests, to try to stop the North American penetration. The problem revolved around economic development and its attendant dislocations, and not a threat to U.S. regional strategic concerns. That strategic threat was largely conjured up by U.S. minister William F. Powell, who had been demanding for years that Washington annex the country.16","['the 1890s', 'years']",san domingo improvement company new york move country 1890s control busy customhouse u.s .- own clyde steamship line main carrier new north investment european threat initially create condition u.s intervention 20 million u.s investment sugar finally prompt european investor lead german french interest try stop north penetration problem revolve economic development attendant dislocation threat u.s regional strategic concern strategic threat largely conjure u.s minister william f. powell demand year washington annex country.16,72,[1890],1890,1,1900,1900
660,"By early 1904, Roosevelt was acutely sensitive to the Dominican concerns because of crises elsewhere in the region. In 1902–3, the British, Germans, and Italians used force to collect debts from a corrupt Venezuelan regime. Roosevelt had been consulted by the Europeans but followed his policy of letting Europeans “spank” Latin Americans and gave his blessing for the spanking. To his surprise, American public opinion became infuriated at the European incursion. The International Court of Justice, moreover, approved the use of the Europeans’ military units, a precedent that threatened to trigger similar interventions. As Roosevelt grew uneasy, Speck von Sternburg suggested that the president exercise police powers so that Europeans would not have to intervene. The idea, Roosevelt replied in March 1903, “is new to me. I will try it out…. A second attempt of foreign powers, to collect their debts by force, would simply not be tolerated here.” When, therefore, the State Department warned him in early 1904 that the American-European competition in the already unstable Dominican Republic threatened revolutions that could harm U.S. interests, Roosevelt was prepared to act. “I want to do nothing but what a policeman has to do in Santo Domingo. As for annexing the island, I have about the same desire to annex it as a gorged boa constrictor might have to swallow a porcupine wrong-end-to.” He intended to move because “the attitude of the Santo Domingans has been one of half chaotic war towards us.”17","['early 1904', 'March 1903', 'early 1904']",early 1904 roosevelt acutely sensitive dominican concern crisis region 1902–3 british german italian force collect debt corrupt venezuelan regime roosevelt consult europeans follow policy let europeans “ spank ” latin american give blessing spanking surprise public opinion infuriate european incursion international court justice approve use europeans’ military unit precedent threaten trigger similar intervention roosevelt grow uneasy speck von sternburg suggest president exercise police power europeans intervene idea roosevelt reply march 1903 “ new try … second attempt foreign power collect debt force simply tolerate ” state department warn early 1904 european competition unstable dominican republic threaten revolution harm u.s interest roosevelt prepare act “ want policeman santo domingo annex island desire annex gorge boa constrictor swallow porcupine wrong end intend “ attitude santo domingan half chaotic war us.”17,128,"[1904, 1903, 1904]",1904,3,1925,1950

When, however, the Dominican government defaulted in its payments to the company, and the company took over a key customhouse to collect for itself, the Europeans again complained. The company, U.S. diplomats, and a compliant Dominican regime (which received a $1.2 million subsidy for its cooperation) asked the United States to take over the customhouses. Roosevelt dispatched ships to protect the country’s government, which had just struck the deal with Washington, against its own irate citizens. The president then arranged a January 1905 treaty that guaranteed the nation’s territorial integrity in return for the United States receiving the right to collect all customs.

Moreover, they began to suspect that foreign bondholders, and not U.S. or Dominican national interests, were to be the real beneficiaries. Defying the Senate and, some thought, the Constitution, Roosevelt put the pact into effect through an executive agreement between himself and the Dominican regime. The take-over was not sufficient to ensure order. The president had to instruct the U.S. navy to stop any revolutionary outbreak. Because U.S. agents ran the highly profitable customhouses, in 1907 two New York banking powers, J. P. Morgan and Kuhn, Loeb and Company, were willing to fund the entire Dominican debt and so brought it under total U.S. control.

Denying any intention of U.S. “aggrandizement,” he declared that the United States only wanted “the other republics on this continent” to be “happy and prosperous,” which, in turn, required that “they maintain order within their boundaries and behave with a just regard for their obligations toward outsiders.” The United States would intervene in “the interest of peace as well as in the interest of justice.” (In an unintended irony, TR added that the new policy would “give the people of Santo Domingo the same chance to move onward and upward which we have already given to the people of Cuba.”) Privately he wrote that the Monroe Doctrine could no longer be “used as a warrant for letting any of these republics remain as small bandit nests of a wicked and inefficient type.”19",['1905'],president justify action announce roosevelt corollary monroe doctrine 1905 annual message deny intention u.s “ aggrandizement ” declare united state want “ republic continent ” “ happy prosperous ” turn require “ maintain order boundary behave regard obligation outsider ” united state intervene “ interest peace interest justice ” unintended irony tr add new policy “ people santo domingo chance onward upward give people cuba ” privately write monroe doctrine longer “ warrant let republic remain small bandit nest wicked inefficient type.”19,82,[1905],1905,1,1925,1950
664,"In reality, Roosevelt had not supported, but inverted, the Monroe Doctrine: In 1823 it had been created to protect Latin American revolutionaries against foreign intervention. In 1905, he redefined it to justify U.S. interventionism against Latin American revolutionaries. The one common theme was, as Elihu Root (Hay’s successor as secretary of state) phrased it, that because the doctrine rested on the U.S. right of self-protection, the United States could define it unilaterally. Washington made the same point when it conditioned its signature to the Hague Conference conventions of 1899 and 1907 for the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Roosevelt, moreover, redefined the doctrine through a use of executive power that greatly enlarged presidential authority and diminished Congress’s already shrinking role in foreign policy. Executive agreements dated back to 1817, but they had been used infrequently before Roosevelt’s 1905 policy was implemented. He opened the door to their increased use until, by the end of the twentieth century, such agreements were employed many more times than treaties to define U.S. relations with other nations. Roosevelt justified this extension of power not only with his belief that the Senate was ill equipped to handle foreign policy, but also with the rationale that the president “is the steward of the people.” The chief executive could carry out his will even if a specific constitutional authorization to do so was lacking, as long as “such action” was not “forbidden by the Constitution or by the laws.”20","['1823', '1905', '1899', '1907', '1817', '1905', 'the end of the twentieth century']",reality roosevelt support invert monroe doctrine 1823 create protect latin revolutionary foreign intervention 1905 redefine justify u.s interventionism latin revolutionary common theme elihu root hay ’s successor secretary state phrase doctrine rest u.s right self protection united state define unilaterally washington point condition signature hague conference convention 1899 1907 permanent court arbitration roosevelt redefine doctrine use executive power greatly enlarge presidential authority diminish congress ’ shrink role foreign policy executive agreement date 1817 infrequently roosevelt ’s 1905 policy implement open door increase use end twentieth century agreement employ time treaty define u.s relation nation roosevelt justify extension power belief senate ill equipped handle foreign policy rationale president “ steward people ” chief executive carry specific constitutional authorization lack long “ action ” “ forbid constitution laws.”20,126,"[1823, 1905, 1899, 1907, 1817, 1905]",1876,6,1900,1900
665,"Protecting U.S. opportunities in such areas as the Caribbean thus led to foreign challenges and internal upheavals that, in turn, helped create the imperial presidency of the twentieth century. Root perhaps best explained the original causes. With North Americans for the first time accumulating “a surplus of capital beyond the requirements of internal development,” the secretary of state declared in 1906, and with “that surplus increasing with extraordinary rapidity,” there had opened “great opportunities for peaceful commercial and industrial expansion to the south.” The Americas, he continued, had come to complement each other; they consequently should follow “the pathway marked out by the far-sighted statesmanship of Blaine for the growth of America, North and South, in the peaceful prosperity of a mighty commerce.” Root had earlier called Roosevelt “the greatest conservative force for the protection of property and our institutions in the city of Washington.”21","['the twentieth century', '1906']",protect u.s opportunity area caribbean lead foreign challenge internal upheaval turn help create imperial presidency twentieth century root best explain original cause north american time accumulate “ surplus capital requirement internal development ” secretary state declare 1906 “ surplus increase extraordinary rapidity ” open “ great opportunity peaceful commercial industrial expansion south ” america continue come complement consequently follow “ pathway mark far sighted statesmanship blaine growth america north south peaceful prosperity mighty commerce ” root earlier call roosevelt “ great conservative force protection property institution city washington.”21,88,[1906],1906,1,1925,1950
666,"Certainly not only TR’s “conservative force” but also the force of his successors was needed to realize Blaine’s policy in Santo Domingo. For the Roosevelt Corollary brought not order, but more upheaval to the Dominicans. With Washington’s help, foreigners dominated the key agricultural export industry of sugar and the more general export-import businesses. Except for these foreigners and the small Dominican elite that depended on the foreigners, the overwhelming majority of the country’s population remained dirt poor as many of the nation’s resources remained undeveloped – not least the production of staple foods for the people. The transportation system was colonial, that is, it was built not to link Dominican cities and markets, but to expedite shipment of export crops to the harbors for overseas sales. Increasingly exploited by class, race, foreign domination, and neocolonial institutions, the Dominicans came to believe that only revolution could give them a chance. The Roosevelt Corollary of 1905 thus led to vast opportunities for North Americans, but also to the disorder that Woodrow Wilson’s intervention of 1916 and eight more years of U.S. military occupation sought to cure.22","['1905', '1916', 'eight more years']",certainly tr ’s “ conservative force ” force successor need realize blaine ’s policy santo domingo roosevelt corollary bring order upheaval dominican washington ’s help foreigner dominate key agricultural export industry sugar general export import business foreigner small dominican elite depend foreigner overwhelming majority country ’s population remain dirt poor nation ’s resource remain undeveloped – production staple food people transportation system colonial build link dominican city market expedite shipment export crop harbor overseas sale increasingly exploit class race foreign domination neocolonial institution dominican come believe revolution chance roosevelt corollary 1905 lead vast opportunity north american disorder woodrow wilson ’s intervention 1916 year u.s military occupation seek cure.22,108,"[1905, 1916]",1910,2,1925,1950
667,"The reasons for the growing animosity between the two giant nations lay elsewhere, especially in the tsar’s refusal to pull back, as he had promised, from Manchuria in early 1903. China, with the other powers’ encouragement, protested unsuccessfully. American cotton exporters again warned Washington about the loss of vital Northeast Asian markets to Russian cotton interests. American officials saw that Witte could not carry through his policy of avoiding clashes in Asia, at least avoiding them until the railroad was finished and an era of calm gave Russia time to develop industrially. “Our strength in Russia is … not with the military or diplomatic sections of the Government,” Hay wrote the U.S. minister in Peking in mid-1903, “but with Mr. Witte and the whole financial world of Russia.” The growing mistrust accelerated in 1903, when the terrible pogrom at Kishinev was revealed. Jewish property was nearly completely destroyed by religiously Orthodox Russians, forty-seven people killed, and hundreds wounded. Public meetings in New York City and elsewhere in the United States condemned the tsar and quickly raised $368,000 to help Russian Jews.23","['early 1903', 'mid-1903', '1903']","reason grow animosity giant nation lie especially tsar ’s refusal pull promise manchuria early 1903 china powers’ encouragement protest unsuccessfully cotton exporter warn washington loss vital northeast asian market russian cotton interest official see witte carry policy avoid clash asia avoid railroad finish era calm give russia time develop industrially “ strength russia … military diplomatic section government ” hay write u.s minister peking mid-1903 “ mr witte financial world russia ” grow mistrust accelerate 1903 terrible pogrom kishinev reveal jewish property nearly completely destroy religiously orthodox russian seven people kill hundred wound public meeting new york city united state condemn tsar quickly raise 368,000 help russian jews.23",108,"[1903, 1903, 1903]",1903,3,1925,1950

Roosevelt thought of himself as an informal partner in the Anglo-Japanese alliance. He shared the fear of Russia and, he thought, the Anglo-Japanese commitment to Open Door principles.

669,"When Japan suddenly struck on February 8, 1904, and destroyed much of the tsar’s Pacific fleet, Roosevelt was pleased. “The Japs will win out,” he told Hay in July 1904. “The Japs have played our game because they have played the game of civilized mankind…. We may be of genuine service if Japan wins out, in preventing interference to rob her of the fruits of her victory” – a reference, of course, to the Europeans’ treatment of Japan after the 1894–5 war. Some U.S. bankers, led by Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb, agreed. Embittered over the tsar’s pogroms, they joined with their British counterparts to finance the Japanese military with some $180 million. Historian Norman Saul has concluded that even if Japan had decided to extend the war in 1905 and go further into debt, “it could have financed the entire war with American money.” U.S. publicists, led by George Kennan, also whipped up public opinion to favor Japan. He had once been pro-Russian, but his ten-month trip through The Siberian Exile System, as his book was called, turned him into perhaps the leading and best-known North American critic of the tsar’s policies. He and TR were close. “If everyone regarded this [war] as Mr. Kennan and I do,” Roosevelt announced at a White House luncheon, “I know where our warships would be.”24","['February 8, 1904', 'July 1904', '1905', 'ten-month']",japan suddenly strike february 8 1904 destroy tsar ’s pacific fleet roosevelt pleased “ jap win ” tell hay july 1904 “ jap play game play game civilized mankind … genuine service japan win prevent interference rob fruit victory ” – reference course europeans’ treatment japan 1894–5 war u.s banker lead jacob schiff kuhn loeb agree embitter tsar ’s pogrom join british counterpart finance japanese military 180 million historian norman saul conclude japan decide extend war 1905 debt “ finance entire war money ” u.s publicist lead george kennan whip public opinion favor japan pro russian month trip siberian exile system book call turn lead best know north critic tsar ’s policy tr close “ regard war mr kennan ” roosevelt announce white house luncheon “ know warship be.”24,129,"[1904, 1904, 1905]",1904,3,1925,1950
670,"A few Americans notably dissented. James Harrison Wilson continued to warn that the key to a stable, developed Asia was U.S.-Russian friendship. He became “more and more persuaded,” Wilson told U.S. diplomat (and China specialist) William Rockhill in mid-1904, “that any national attitude of undue sympathy with the Japanese or of policy which estranges Russia from us is a great mistake.” He argued for a deal with Russia that would ensure an “open door to Manchuria,” and one with Japan that would allow Tokyo to control the Philippines in return for commercial preferences for U.S. traders. Then, he believed, “we shall have called a New Empire into existence to readjust the balance of the world!

671,"One of the strongest was exemplified in a paper presented at London’s Royal Geographical Society in January 1904 by Halford Mackinder of Oxford University. Titled “The Geographical Pivot of History,” it argued that with the world fully discovered, expansionism would be replaced by power emanating from development and central geographic location. Hence, Mackinder suggested, the British (and, by implication, the American) navy was becoming of less importance than central Russia, which occupied the world’s “pivot area” and was being developed so that it had the potential to control the great Eurasian landmass. If Mackinder was correct, Mahan’s warning about the Russian menace might be accurate, but the American strategist’s solution – a huge battleship fleet – could be irrelevant. Russia had to be contained, its power broken up, on the Eurasian mainland itself.25",['January 1904'],strong exemplify paper present london ’s royal geographical society january 1904 halford mackinder oxford university title “ geographical pivot history ” argue world fully discover expansionism replace power emanate development central geographic location mackinder suggest british implication navy importance central russia occupy world ’s “ pivot area ” develop potential control great eurasian landmass mackinder correct mahan ’s warning russian menace accurate strategist ’s solution – huge battleship fleet – irrelevant russia contain power break eurasian mainland itself.25,78,[1904],1904,1,1925,1950
672,"By early 1905, the tsar was indeed using the completed sections of the Trans-Siberian Railway to move several times more troops and equipment to the war front than he had at the start of the conflict. The Japanese clearly lacked the resources to win decisively in a much longer war. The outbreak of a revolution against the tsar in St. Petersburg on “Bloody Sunday,” January 9, 1905, however, and a second Japanese naval victory, demonstrated that both sides needed peace. Roosevelt offered mediation, and at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, peace terms were hammered out, with great difficulty, in mid-1905. Despite its weakness at the end of the fighting, Japan attained most of its goals: exclusive rights in Korea; the take-over of the vital South Manchuria Railway, which blocked Russian movement to the south; and the southern half of strategic Sakhalin Island. Because Japan did not also obtain an indemnity, riots erupted in Tokyo. Both nations agreed to restore Chinese authority in Manchuria, although given the Russian railway concession in the north and Japan’s in the south, this gesture to the Open Door was empty.","['early 1905', 'January 9, 1905', 'mid-1905']",early 1905 tsar complete section trans siberian railway time troop equipment war start conflict japanese clearly lack resource win decisively long war outbreak revolution tsar st petersburg “ bloody sunday ” january 9 1905 second japanese naval victory demonstrate side need peace roosevelt offer mediation portsmouth new hampshire peace term hammer great difficulty mid-1905 despite weakness end fighting japan attain goal exclusive right korea vital south manchuria railway block russian movement south southern half strategic sakhalin island japan obtain indemnity riot erupt tokyo nation agree restore chinese authority manchuria give russian railway concession north japan ’ south gesture open door,100,"[1905, 1905, 1905]",1905,3,1925,1950
673,"Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize for his mediation, but he failed to gain either a Japanese commitment to the Open Door principles or a balance of power that could protect U.S. interests in Asia. He had to recognize that not only had Japan emerged as the most powerful nation in northeastern Asia, but also it was refusing any longer to protect American markets, most notably in Korea, which the Japanese quickly seized in the first weeks of the war. Roosevelt now ignored the 1882 U.S.-Korean treaty in which the Americans pledged to help protect Korea’s independence (at least by offering “good offices”). He instead did nothing in 1905 when Tokyo turned the country into a Japanese protectorate. The most TR extracted was the secret Taft-Katsura deal (another executive agreement), of July 1905, in which the United States recognized Japan’s power in Korea in return for Tokyo recognizing U.S. control of the Philippines. But for Roosevelt, worse lay just ahead. The 1905 uprising in Russia, triggered by the Japanese-inflicted defeats, became one in a series of revolutionary outbreaks that marked the opening of the twentieth century: Persia in 1906, Turkey and Vietnam in 1908, China and Mexico in 1911, and finally Russia in 1917.26","['the first weeks', '1882', '1905', 'July 1905', '1905', 'the twentieth century', '1906', '1908', '1911']",roosevelt win nobel peace prize mediation fail gain japanese commitment open door principle balance power protect u.s interest asia recognize japan emerge powerful nation northeastern asia refuse longer protect market notably korea japanese quickly seize week war roosevelt ignore 1882 u.s .- korean treaty american pledge help protect korea ’s independence offer “ good office ” instead 1905 tokyo turn country japanese protectorate tr extract secret taft katsura deal executive agreement july 1905 united state recognize japan ’s power korea return tokyo recognize u.s control philippine roosevelt bad lie ahead 1905 uprising russia trigger japanese inflict defeat series revolutionary outbreak mark opening twentieth century persia 1906 turkey vietnam 1908 china mexico 1911 finally russia 1917.26,115,"[1882, 1905, 1905, 1905, 1906, 1908, 1911]",1903,7,1925,1950

675,"Roosevelt’s Asian policies received two other decisive jolts in 1905. The first had originated with U.S. discrimination against Chinese immigrants in the post-1880 era. These acts climaxed at the 1904 St. Louis Exposition, where official Chinese delegates were abused. Peking retaliated by refusing to renew its immigration treaty with the United States. Merchants in major Chinese ports joined by totally boycotting U.S. goods. The boycott was not discouraged by European and Japanese competitors of American products. Roosevelt was amazed. His low opinion of these people was marked by his tendency to call a particularly inefficient and unsuccessful person a “Chinese.” He demanded that the Qing officials force the merchants to drop the boycott. The Qing dynasty responded positively but then revealed its true feelings by posting upside down, in many cities, the proclamation to end the boycott. The boycott finally ended, but Roosevelt had confronted a new type of Chinese antiforeign movement.","['1905', '1904', 'The Qing dynasty']",roosevelt ’s asian policy receive decisive jolt 1905 originate u.s discrimination chinese immigrant post-1880 era act climax 1904 st louis exposition official chinese delegate abuse peking retaliate refuse renew immigration treaty united state merchant major chinese port join totally boycott u.s good boycott discourage european japanese competitor product roosevelt amazed low opinion people mark tendency particularly inefficient unsuccessful person “ chinese demand qing official force merchant drop boycott qing dynasty respond positively reveal true feeling post upside city proclamation end boycott boycott finally end roosevelt confront new type chinese antiforeign movement,91,"[1905, 1904]",1904,2,1925,1950

Unknown to TR, Morgan had actually secretly helped the original railway concessionaires, the American China Development Company, sell out at immense profit to King Leopold of Belgium. The deal broke the U.S. promise to China that the railway would be controlled only by Americans. As the Chinese and Roosevelt protested the sellout, Morgan reluctantly agreed to repurchase the concession. China, now believing the Americans were as untrustworthy as other foreigners, demanded the return of the concession. Roosevelt asked Morgan to stand firm. The banker, seeing an opportunity to sell the concession once more at a profit, and not showing explicit confidence in TR’s grasp of Asian diplomacy, sold the valuable railway rights to Peking.27",['1904'],second blow land 1904 president beg j. p. morgan u.s banker save control important hankow canton railway concession unknown tr morgan actually secretly help original railway concessionaire china development company sell immense profit king leopold belgium deal break u.s promise china railway control american chinese roosevelt protest sellout morgan reluctantly agree repurchase concession china believe american untrustworthy foreigner demand return concession roosevelt ask morgan stand firm banker see opportunity sell concession profit show explicit confidence tr ’s grasp asian diplomacy sell valuable railway right peking.27,85,[1904],1904,1,1925,1950

678,"The failure in Asia, however, threatened to bring about historic consequences, given the rhetoric and expressed needs of U.S. exporters and officials since the days of Seward. In 1907, Japan tightened its grip on Korea by excluding many U.S. goods. The pro-Japanese Rockhill claimed Tokyo was simply trying to get rid of war surpluses, but the tightening was actually a step toward full annexation of Korea in 1910. Also in 1907, Japan and Russia effectively divided Manchuria between themselves. Roosevelt was also bedeviled by anti-Japanese riots that erupted in California because of the rising number of Japanese living in the state. He finally worked out a gentleman’s agreement in which Tokyo promised to control emigration and Washington tried to protect Japanese already in America. Especially surprising, however, was TR’s candid admission that the furor in California was “a race question….

They concluded that Japan was a possible enemy, and, in case of war with Japan, the Philippines could not be held. U.S. forces would have to be pulled back to Hawaii. Congressional refusal to build up the distant Pacific bases at Guam and the Philippines, as well as bitter interservice rivalries that made the development of a common strategy difficult, combined with the growing Japanese power to shape the plan. Roosevelt tried to display his military reach by sending the U.S. navy (now containing twenty-two modern battleships) on an around-the-world voyage in 1907–8 that notably scheduled special stops in Japan. The Japanese were most friendly, and the ships proved seaworthy, but the trip did nothing to change the balance of power.

They are all that make the present situation with Japan dangerous.” The last sentence indicated that he had given up trying to maintain the Open Door in the great markets of Manchuria. All doubts were removed in 1908 when he helped shape the Root-Takahira deal (another executive agreement), in which the United States recognized Japan’s interests in Manchuria. The Root-Takahira agreement ended the attempt of desperate Chinese officials to entice U.S. and other foreign interests into Manchuria to block Japan.29","['1899', '1907', '1908']",1899 roosevelt condemn opponent philippine annexation “ man bygone age ” 1907 force admit island give independence earlier prefer “ form heel achille present situation japan dangerous ” sentence indicate give try maintain open door great market manchuria doubt remove 1908 help shape root takahira deal executive agreement united state recognize japan ’s interest manchuria root takahira agreement end attempt desperate chinese official entice u.s foreign interest manchuria block japan.29,70,"[1899, 1907, 1908]",1905,3,1925,1950

Roosevelt’s own views evolved over the next five years. He warned friends that Western powers must not try to stop Japan’s “natural expansion” into the Asian mainland, because otherwise Japanese would move in large numbers to Canada and the United States. Simultaneously, he became more radical politically by coming out in favor of imposing inheritance and income taxes, implementing stronger regulation of interstate businesses, fixing railroad rates, and building up the labor movement. He condemned “malefactors of great wealth” in 1907 (even as he worked with J. P. Morgan to end an economic panic), condemned as well “predatory wealth,” demanded federal regulation of stock exchange practices, and gave his Nobel Peace Prize money to a foundation for industrial peace.30","['1907', 'the next five years', '1907']",american head wealthy internationalist hamilton holt found japanese society amid 1907 crisis effort build network understanding people roosevelt ’s view evolve year warn friend western power try stop japan ’s “ natural expansion ” asian mainland japanese large number canada united state simultaneously radical politically come favor impose inheritance income tax implement strong regulation interstate business fix railroad rate build labor movement condemn “ malefactor great wealth ” 1907 work j. p. morgan end economic panic condemn “ predatory wealth ” demand federal regulation stock exchange practice give nobel peace prize money foundation industrial peace.30,95,"[1907, 1907]",1907,2,1925,1950
682,"President William Howard Taft and Secretary of State Philander C. Knox were responsible for conducting U.S. foreign policy when, between 1909 and 1913, two generations of American diplomatic history climaxed in Canada, Central America, Mexico, and Asia. Viewed by many scholars, not incorrectly, as sometimes lethargic and often unimaginative, Taft and Knox shared a love for the law, as well as the respect for property, precedent, compromise, peaceful settlements, and the power of money that are common to many lawyers. Taft was happiest not as president but later when he served as chief justice of the Supreme Court. “The truth is,” he said then, “that in my present life I don’t remember that I ever was President.” Taft did remember, however, the forces that shaped his world. At the center of “all modern, successful civilization,” he declared in 1906, was “the right of property and the motive of accumulation.”1","['between 1909 and 1913', '1906']",president william howard taft secretary state philander c. knox responsible conduct u.s foreign policy 1909 1913 generation diplomatic history climax canada central america mexico asia view scholar incorrectly lethargic unimaginative taft knox share love law respect property precedent compromise peaceful settlement power money common lawyer taft happy president later serve chief justice supreme court “ truth ” say “ present life not remember president ” taft remember force shape world center “ modern successful civilization ” declare 1906 “ right property motive accumulation.”1,83,[1906],1906,1,1925,1950
683,"As Taft entered office in 1909, Herbert Croly, a hitherto little-known editor of an architectural journal, published The Promise of American Life. Roosevelt called the book “the most profound and illuminating study of our national conditions which has appeared in many years.” Political observers soon began to see Croly’s influence on Roosevelt’s thinking as the restless former president shaped a new program to recapture the White House in 1912. The book became a landmark in progressivism because it used an interpretation of the past to provide striking insights into the future.","['1909', 'many years', '1912']",taft enter office 1909 herbert croly hitherto little know editor architectural journal publish promise life roosevelt call book “ profound illuminating study national condition appear year ” political observer soon begin croly ’s influence roosevelt ’s thinking restless president shape new program recapture white house 1912 book landmark progressivism interpretation past provide striking insight future,55,"[1909, 1912]",1910,2,1925,1950
684,"Croly wrote that three themes from that history had become central by 1909: a nationalism whose post–Civil War surge made the state more than the sum of its political and economic factions; a democracy that had to be rethought in a frontierless, newly industrialized society; and an efficiency that determined who survived in cutthroat international competition. Although each of these ideas was sometimes viewed as contradictory to the other two, Croly argued that in the twentieth century only a strong, Hamiltonian, nationalist state could secure both a Jeffersonian democracy and capitalist efficiency. Breaking with those Progressives who preached more democracy through the use of the referendum and recall, Croly argued that modern democracy required the protection of a centralized national state. Within that state the pivotal unit, the corporation, would not be controlled by antitrust measures (for they produced inefficiency) but by federal regulation and the countervailing powers of strong, legal labor unions. Croly thus tried to reconcile the tensions that lay at the heart of American political debate during the Second Industrial Revolution: The American “people collectively have become more of a democracy in proportion as they have become more of a nation. Their democracy is to be realized by means of an intensification of their national life.”2","['1909', 'the twentieth century']",croly write theme history central 1909 nationalism post – civil war surge state sum political economic faction democracy rethink frontierless newly industrialize society efficiency determine survive cutthroat international competition idea view contradictory croly argue twentieth century strong hamiltonian nationalist state secure jeffersonian democracy capitalist efficiency break progressive preach democracy use referendum recall croly argue modern democracy require protection centralized national state state pivotal unit corporation control antitrust measure produce inefficiency federal regulation countervail power strong legal labor union croly try reconcile tension lie heart political debate second industrial revolution “ people collectively democracy proportion nation democracy realize mean intensification national life.”2,101,[1909],1909,1,1925,1950
685,"As one of his biographers has noted, Croly combined “an internationalized imperialism with democratic nationalism.”5 It was this combination that many Progressives, as well as some conservatives, found irresistible. The formulation justified what they were doing at home and hoped to do abroad. Taft and Knox bought much of this argument, but they were selective. Taft’s view of nationalism was more skeptical than Croly’s, as was his confidence in democracy, either at home or, especially, abroad. The 320-pound president was not one for undertaking too many missions. He admitted both an “indisposition to labor as hard as I might” and an inability to keep up with his work (which, as his chief aide noted, meant Taft might “be about three years behind when the fourth of March, 1913, rolls around”). He was also full of self-doubt, especially in having to follow Roosevelt. On inauguration day morning, a cold storm hit Washington. Roosevelt said it was a fitting way to end his presidency. Taft replied, “You’re wrong. It is my storm. I always knew it would be a cold day when I became President of the United States.”6","['about three years', 'the fourth of March, 1913']",biographer note croly combine “ internationalized imperialism democratic nationalism.”5 combination progressive conservative find irresistible formulation justify home hop abroad taft knox buy argument selective taft ’s view nationalism skeptical croly ’s confidence democracy home especially abroad 320-pound president undertake mission admit “ indisposition labor hard inability work chief aide note mean taft “ year fourth march 1913 roll ” self doubt especially have follow roosevelt inauguration day morning cold storm hit washington roosevelt say fitting way end presidency taft reply “ be wrong storm know cold day president united states.”6,90,[1913],1913,1,1925,1950
686,"Taft only timidly followed Croly’s analysis in regard to tariff revision and Canadian reciprocity, and paid dearly. The Payne tariff bill passed the House in 1909 with a free list and lower rates that pleased exporters and importers. In the Senate, however, protectionist interests retaliated; the resulting Payne-Aldrich bill hardly met Croly’s standards for a moderate tariff. Taft made it worse, however, by failing to restore the free list, and then praising the results. His remarks alienated industrial exporters, raw material importers, and Progressive tariff revisionists. Roosevelt had not helped. He refused to fight these battles earlier and now did little to help Taft.

687,"Taft believed that foreign trade was increasingly vital to U.S. prosperity and that trade, as well as investment, was rapidly moving north. In 1909, Americans sent $207 million worth of goods to Canada, or twice the amount sent to the second-best customer, Great Britain. Since 1900, U.S. investment in Canada (especially in mines and forests) had nearly quadrupled to $750 million. Washington officials, moreover, searched for a weapon to destroy Canadian-British economic links, especially after 1907, when Canada’s new tariff favored British markets and discriminated against the giant southern neighbor. Neither Taft nor Prime Minister Wilfred Laurier wanted to face a possible trade war, but the Americans also had another agenda driving their policy. As Charles Pepper of the Bureau of Trade Relations informed Knox in a memorandum titled “The Open Door to Canada,” removing Canada from the British trade orbit could undermine the entire British imperial preferential tariff system and change the course of trade “from west to east and from east to west” to “north to south and south to north.” Taft fully endorsed such a rerouting. He privately told Roosevelt that if a Canadian reciprocity pact could be negotiated, it “would make Canada only an adjunct of the United States.” Taft pushed through his bill to begin to realize a North American continental market, but in Ottawa, Conservatives, strongly supported by British interests and helped by ill-timed remarks by Washington politicians about the probability of future annexation of Canada, defeated the legislation. Croly’s and Taft’s nationalism had been too blatant, too impolitic, to realize one of its greatest foreign policy objectives.8","['1909', '1900', '1907']",taft believe foreign trade increasingly vital u.s prosperity trade investment rapidly move north 1909 american send 207 million worth good canada twice send second good customer great britain 1900 u.s investment canada especially mine forest nearly quadruple 750 million washington official search weapon destroy canadian british economic link especially 1907 canada ’s new tariff favor british market discriminate giant southern neighbor taft prime minister wilfred laurier want face possible trade war american agenda drive policy charles pepper bureau trade relation inform knox memorandum title “ open door canada ” remove canada british trade orbit undermine entire british imperial preferential tariff system change course trade “ west east east west ” “ north south south north ” taft fully endorse rerouting privately tell roosevelt canadian reciprocity pact negotiate “ canada adjunct united state ” taft push bill begin realize north continental market ottawa conservative strongly support british interest help ill time remark washington politician probability future annexation canada defeat legislation croly ’s taft ’s nationalism blatant impolitic realize great foreign policy objectives.8,171,"[1909, 1900, 1907]",1905,3,1925,1950
688,"The phrase was indeed accurate except that it overstated the president’s reluctance to use force. During the 1894 Pullman strike, federal judge Taft had been willing to give orders to “shoot to kill” the strike’s leaders. As Roosevelt’s man in Cuba and the Philippines, and later as president ordering troops into Nicaragua, he also did not blanch at the use of force. One of his important diplomats in Asia, Willard Straight, rightly defined dollar diplomacy as “the financial expression of John Hay’s ‘open door’ policy.” From Seward to Hay, U.S. officials had often not hesitated to use bullets when dollars proved inadequate.9",['1894'],phrase accurate overstate president ’s reluctance use force 1894 pullman strike federal judge taft willing order “ shoot kill ” strike ’s leader roosevelt ’s man cuba philippine later president order troop nicaragua blanch use force important diplomat asia willard straight rightly define dollar diplomacy “ financial expression john hay ’s ‘ open door’ policy ” seward hay u.s official hesitate use bullet dollar prove inadequate.9,66,[1894],1894,1,1900,1900
689,"Imperialism was, at bottom, a clash of governments, that is, of Croly’s nationalisms. For example, the long American attempts to turn imperialism into a kind of free-market, open-door competition in Asia had collapsed amid the Chinese nationalism on the bullet-riddled streets of Peking during 1900, if not long before. Free-market competition paradoxically required ever greater state participation. To call U.S. policy “dollar diplomacy,” Taft himself observed, was “to ignore entirely a most useful office to be performed by a government in its dealings with foreign governments.” Hence the president created the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce in the Commerce Department to help individual firms compete overseas.10 Dollar diplomacy, in all, was a partnership among the government, bankers, military, and the wealthy native comprador elite that had integrated itself into the American system. Dollar diplomacy was Croly’s powerful national state wedded to the Second Industrial Revolution. Taft and Knox tried to remove one large obstacle from the foreign affairs process in 1910 when the president shocked a New York audience by urging that “matters of national honor” should be referred to an arbitration court, just as were questions of property. After internationalist and peace organizations quickly supported this initiative, Knox signed two trial treaties with Great Britain and France, which declared that all justiciable disputes were to be arbitrated, and all other issues could be referred to a joint high commission, which would decide whether arbitration or some other means of settlement would be exercised. A major, indeed historic, breakthrough in the long quest for imposing order and fair process without resort to arms seemed ready to bless the globe. Taft, however, had not reckoned with Roosevelt or the Senate. Roosevelt blasted the treaties for “sloppy thinking” and was joined by Alfred Thayer Mahan in claiming that vital U.S. interests (such as the Monroe Doctrine) could not be entrusted to joint commissions until international law was further developed.

He dreamed of spreading his power over a united Central America, a dream that had not been realized since the first, heady days of independence from Spain in the 1830s. Washington’s decision to build the canal in Panama smashed Zelaya’s hope of using U.S. dollars to enrich his nation and make it a pivot of global trade. He approached Europeans and Japanese about financing a Nicaraguan canal, gave concessions increasingly to non-U.S. groups, and waged a series of wars to recoup his fortunes by bringing other nations, especially El Salvador, under his control. After 1906, U.S. officials covertly helped a revolutionary group in El Salvador, which duly promised to be friendly to Washington. The North Americans also urged Costa Rica to attack Nicaragua.12","['1893', 'days', 'the 1830s', '1906']",1893 josé santos zelaya seek use dictatorial rule develop nicaragua dream spread power united central america dream realize heady day independence spain 1830s washington ’s decision build canal panama smash zelaya ’s hope u.s dollar enrich nation pivot global trade approach european japanese finance nicaraguan canal give concession increasingly non u.s group wag series war recoup fortune bring nation especially el salvador control 1906 u.s official covertly help revolutionary group el salvador duly promise friendly washington north american urge costa rica attack nicaragua.12,83,"[1893, 1830, 1906]",1876,3,1900,1900

During a war between Honduras (supported by Guatemala) and Nicaragua in 1907, Theodore Roosevelt and Mexican dictator Porfirio Díaz intervened just as Zelaya was gaining the upper hand. The mediation led to the creation of a Central American Court (based in a handsome Costa Rican structure built by Andrew Carnegie’s millions), which hoped to stop future wars through processes of law. The court lasted until 1916, when its decisions ruled against U.S. claims in the Nicaraguan region and the United States then effectively destroyed it.","['1907', '1916']",zelaya ’s major competitor guatemala ’s leader estrada cabrera try organize coalition nicaragua war honduras support guatemala nicaragua 1907 theodore roosevelt mexican dictator porfirio díaz intervene zelaya gain upper hand mediation lead creation central court base handsome costa rican structure build andrew carnegie ’s million hop stop future war process law court last 1916 decision rule u.s claim nicaraguan region united state effectively destroy,64,"[1907, 1916]",1912,2,1925,1950

Zelaya made the fatal error of executing two U.S. mercenaries he caught trying to blow up some of his troops.

693,"The U.S. involvement, however, had only begun. Washington’s chosen government for Nicaragua did not meet the approval of many Nicaraguans, especially after the puppet regime turned over majority interest in the nation’s railroads and the national bank to New York financiers in return for large loans. The surprised U.S. minister, Elliott Northcott, expecting on his arrival in 1911 to be greeted as a savior, wired home that not only did Guatemala and El Salvador oppose the new Managua regime, but also “the natural sentiment of an overwhelming majority of Nicaraguans is antagonistic to the United States” – an antagonism expressed when citizens tried to blow up the government’s palace and arsenal the day of Northcott’s arrival. In 1912, when a revolt led by a respected general erupted against Washington’s handpicked president, Adolfo Díaz, Taft landed 2,600 troops to put down the uprising and keep Díaz in power. Marines remained in Nicaragua until 1925, when their withdrawal set off another revolt. As their overthrow of Zelaya and activities elsewhere in the region indicated, U.S. officials had nothing against the principle of revolution. In certain circumstances, Taft and Knox, resembling Roosevelt, even preferred revolution over order. They sought only to discriminate among those who were, and were not, to be favored by Washington-sponsored upheavals.13","['1911', 'the day', '1912', '1925']","u.s involvement begin washington ’s choose government nicaragua meet approval nicaraguan especially puppet regime turn majority interest nation ’s railroad national bank new york financier return large loan surprised u.s minister elliott northcott expect arrival 1911 greet savior wire home guatemala el salvador oppose new managua regime “ natural sentiment overwhelming majority nicaraguan antagonistic united state – antagonism express citizen try blow government ’s palace arsenal day northcott ’s arrival 1912 revolt lead respect general erupt washington ’s handpick president adolfo díaz taft land 2,600 troop uprising díaz power marine remain nicaragua 1925 withdrawal set revolt overthrow zelaya activity region indicate u.s official principle revolution certain circumstance taft knox resemble roosevelt preferred revolution order seek discriminate favor washington sponsor upheavals.13",120,"[1911, 1912, 1925]",1916,3,1925,1950
694,"A historic turn in Honduras also demonstrated how North Americans favored opportunity over order. A poor country, Honduras nevertheless had enough land, fairly distributed, to support most campesinos until the late 1880s. A banana plantation boom then occurred to take advantage of the new markets opening for the fruit in the Americas and Europe. By 1910, 80 percent of the banana plantations were controlled by U.S. companies. These firms not only held the nation’s best lands and transportation networks but also instigated wars to control the government. When Huntington Wilson complained that “Honduras has politically, financially, and economically about as bad a record for stability as can be found on the face of the earth,” it was as much a judgment on North Americans as on Hondurans. Headed by Sam “The Banana Man” Zemurray, a group of U.S. investors and adventurers headed out of New Orleans in early 1911 to seize power. When President Miguel Dávila asked for help, Knox offered it in return for the U.S. right to intervene and control Honduran customhouses. The Honduran Congress, surrounded by angry mobs who threatened the representatives with death if they accepted the Knox-Dávila deal, unsurprisingly rejected it. Zemurray then effectively took power, combined with the United Fruit Company of Boston (or “the Octopus,” as Latin Americans soon termed it), and turned Honduras into the prototype of a banana republic.14 When revolts produced power for U.S. citizens and interests, such uprisings were much to be preferred over stability – especially stability imposed by native governments that Washington believed were weak, as well as suspect in their appreciation for the Monroe Doctrine and its recent corollary.","['the late 1880s', '1910', 'early 1911']",historic turn honduras demonstrate north american favor opportunity order poor country honduras land fairly distribute support campesino late 1880 banana plantation boom occur advantage new market open fruit america europe 1910 80 percent banana plantation control u.s company firm hold nation ’s good land transportation network instigate war control government huntington wilson complain “ hondura politically financially economically bad record stability find face earth ” judgment north american honduran head sam “ banana man ” zemurray group u.s investor adventurer head new orlean early 1911 seize power president miguel dávila ask help knox offer return u.s right intervene control honduran customhouse honduran congress surround angry mob threaten representative death accept knox dávila deal unsurprisingly reject zemurray effectively take power combine united fruit company boston “ octopus ” latin american soon term turn hondura prototype banana republic.14 revolt produce power u.s citizen interest uprising prefer stability – especially stability impose native government washington believe weak suspect appreciation monroe doctrine recent corollary,160,"[1880, 1910, 1911]",1900,3,1925,1950
695,"Since the 1870s, Mexico’s dictator, Porfirio Díaz, had ensured that his nation would not be a banana republic, but his welcoming of U.S. investment nevertheless made Mexico into a dependent of the northern republic. The dollar flow increased as the ruler’s colleagues grew older, more satisfied, and less flexible. A 1902 report revealed that North Americans had invested a half-billion dollars, with more than one-half entering in only the previous six years. The money went into oil concessions, silver and other mining operations, and huge plantations, including those developed for rubber growing and export agriculture.","['the 1870s', '1902', 'the previous six years']",1870s mexico ’s dictator porfirio díaz ensure nation banana republic welcoming u.s investment mexico dependent northern republic dollar flow increase ruler ’s colleague grow old satisfied flexible 1902 report reveal north american invest half billion dollar half enter previous year money go oil concession silver mining operation huge plantation include develop rubber growing export agriculture,55,"[1870, 1902]",1886,2,1900,1900
696,"But this was only a prelude. Between 1903 and 1910 investments skyrocketed to three times those of 1876 to 1900. By 1910, the nearly $2 billion (American billion) of U.S. investment owned 43 percent of Mexico’s property; 15 million Mexicans owned 33 percent, and other foreign investors 24 percent. In some sectors, the Americans’ presence was overwhelming. For example, they controlled two-thirds of the rubber business, which, with the automobile, was beginning to undergo a global boom in demand. In other fields, such as oil, Americans were in heated competition with other foreign, especially British, investors. American citizens nevertheless seemed to dominate the industry by 1905. A key U.S. banker, James Speyer, told the German ambassador in 1904 that “in the United States there is a pervasive feeling that Mexico is no longer anything but a dependency of the American economy, in the same way that the entire area from the Mexican border to the Panama Canal [all of Central America] is seen as part of North America.” After a visit to Mexico, Andrew Carnegie said with delight, “[I]n every corner of the Republic reigned prosperity and an enviable peace.”15","['Between 1903 and 1910', '1876', '1910', '1905', '1904']",prelude 1903 1910 investment skyrocket time 1876 1900 1910 nearly 2 billion billion u.s investment own 43 percent mexico ’s property 15 million mexican own 33 percent foreign investor 24 percent sector americans’ presence overwhelming example control third rubber business automobile begin undergo global boom demand field oil american heated competition foreign especially british investor citizen dominate industry 1905 key u.s banker james speyer tell german ambassador 1904 “ united state pervasive feeling mexico long dependency economy way entire area mexican border panama canal central america see north america ” visit mexico andrew carnegie say delight “ i]n corner republic reign prosperity enviable peace.”15,104,"[1876, 1910, 1905, 1904]",1899,4,1900,1900
697,"Carnegie had not looked deeply enough. The massive foreign investments transformed Mexico. As haciendas evolved to export sugar and hemp, landless peasants grew in number and the production of staple food dropped. Mexico grew more corn and beans for domestic consumption in 1867 than in 1910. Prices rose because of the need to import staples from the more expensive United States and the ability of wealthy urban and rural elites to purchase these items. As agricultural exports increased in the early 1900s, U.S. and Mexican capitalists intensified their drive to seize peasant lands. American-built railroads carried the goods to ports but also penetrated and threatened communal life, especially in northern Mexico. Discontented peasants had long been known in the country, but by 1910 there were many more than had existed twenty years before, and they were joined by rural laborers who were more rootless and more radical. In the cities, the influx of capital created a new, literate, and politically aware middle class. The group was not radical, but by 1910 it had developed several demands: more Mexican control over Mexican affairs, and more young blood (like its own) to replace the gerontocracy that surrounded Díaz, who had now ruled for nearly four decades.16","['1867', '1910', 'the early 1900s', '1910', 'twenty years', '1910']",carnegie look deeply massive foreign investment transform mexico hacienda evolve export sugar hemp landless peasant grow number production staple food drop mexico grow corn bean domestic consumption 1867 1910 price rise need import staple expensive united state ability wealthy urban rural elite purchase item agricultural export increase early 1900s u.s mexican capitalist intensify drive seize peasant land build railroad carry good port penetrate threaten communal life especially northern mexico discontented peasant long know country 1910 exist year join rural laborer rootless radical city influx capital create new literate politically aware middle class group radical 1910 develop demand mexican control mexican affair young blood like replace gerontocracy surround díaz rule nearly decades.16,111,"[1867, 1910, 1900, 1910, 1910]",1899,5,1900,1900
698,"The U.S. panic of 1907 demonstrated the price of being dependent on the giant northern neighbor. As New York capital dried up, Mexican exports dropped, investment disappeared, thousands of Mexican immigrants to the United States suddenly began to return home, and unrest spread. Having begun to understand the dangers of dependence after the stunning U.S. victory in the 1898 war and the quick imperialism that had struck Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Panama, Díaz had already moved to loosen the U.S. economic grip. He grew especially concerned that the U.S. firms moving in were no longer medium-sized and manageable but the outsized products of the post-1897 merger movement, such as Standard Oil and the railroads, which could not be easily managed. Díaz nationalized many of the U.S.-controlled railroad lines (but not the British), imposed duties that raised the price of raw materials headed for the northern border, and during 1907–8 worked to attract European capital to fill the vacuum left by the New York panic. He launched a special attack on Standard Oil by excluding it from rich oil fields while cutting its share of Mexico’s illuminating and machine oil market from 99 percent to 44 percent between 1904 and 1910. Díaz meanwhile gave increased preference to British oil, especially to Lord Cowdray, whose powerful interests checked Standard Oil and by 1910 controlled 58 percent of Mexico’s petroleum production.17","['1907', '1898', 'between 1904 and 1910', '1910']",u.s panic 1907 demonstrate price dependent giant northern neighbor new york capital dry mexican export drop investment disappear thousand mexican immigrant united state suddenly begin return home unrest spread have begin understand danger dependence stunning u.s victory 1898 war quick imperialism strike cuba puerto rico panama díaz move loosen u.s economic grip grow especially concerned u.s firm move longer medium sized manageable outsized product post-1897 merger movement standard oil railroad easily manage díaz nationalize u.s .- control railroad line british impose duty raise price raw material head northern border 1907–8 work attract european capital fill vacuum leave new york panic launch special attack standard oil exclude rich oil field cut share mexico ’s illuminating machine oil market 99 percent 44 percent 1904 1910 díaz give increase preference british oil especially lord cowdray powerful interest check standard oil 1910 control 58 percent mexico ’s petroleum production.17,145,"[1907, 1898, 1910]",1905,3,1925,1950
699,"He was joined by two quite different, more radical, figures – Emiliano Zapata and Pascual Orozco – who mobilized peasants and rural laborers in the south and north, respectively, and particularly in areas where foreign investment pressures were greatest. Conditions were ripe. By 1900, perhaps 82 percent of the campesinos had no land, and 1 percent of the population owned 97 percent of the fertile land. The growing revolutionary movement was marked less by antiforeign violence (few attacks on foreigners – except Chinese – occurred even during the bloodiest outbreaks) than by the Mexicans’ hatred of Díaz for dealing so much of their wealth to North Americans and the British. As Díaz’s power slipped, Taft and Knox signaled that the old president had fallen from favor; one clear signal was their allowing Madero’s supporters to obtain arms in the United States. Díaz realized that he had to depart before the moderate opposition turned into an unpredictable uprising. “Madero has unleashed a tiger!” the old man observed. “Now let us see if he can control it.”18",['1900'],join different radical figure – emiliano zapata pascual orozco – mobilize peasant rural laborer south north respectively particularly area foreign investment pressure great condition ripe 1900 82 percent campesino land 1 percent population own 97 percent fertile land grow revolutionary movement mark antiforeign violence attack foreigner – chinese – occur bloody outbreak mexicans’ hatred díaz deal wealth north american british díaz ’s power slip taft knox signal old president fall favor clear signal allow madero ’s supporter obtain arm united state díaz realize depart moderate opposition turn unpredictable uprising “ madero unleash tiger ” old man observe “ let control it.”18,101,[1900],1900,1,1925,1950
700,"He could not. Obtaining power in June 1911, Madero unsurprisingly retained many of Díaz’s advisers. He did nothing about major land reform or foreign capital, an inaction that also was not surprising, given his closeness to Stillman, U.S. railroad entrepreneurs, and powerful Texas bankers who had protected him during his struggle against Díaz (the Madero family’s males and many of these American businessmen’s sons had even been educated in the same classrooms at Culver Military Academy in Indiana). Standard Oil, scholars much later discovered, had probably offered Madero between $500,000 and $1 million to help overthrow Díaz. Furious at the absence of land reform that would return haciendas to the campesinos, Zapata and his officers issued the Plan of Ayala in November 1911. Joined by Orozco in the north, the Zapatistas pushed events to a new, more radical stage. As the revolt of rural and urban working classes spread, accompanied by growing violence, Madero found he had also lost the support of army officers who had remained loyal to Díaz. Strikes, fighting, and land seizures erupted. Madero could do little, however, until he placed General Victoriano Huerta in charge of his army. Huerta stopped the Zapatistas but came to realize that Madero was too weak to rule.","['June 1911', 'November 1911']","obtain power june 1911 madero unsurprisingly retain díaz ’s adviser major land reform foreign capital inaction surprising give closeness stillman u.s railroad entrepreneur powerful texas banker protect struggle díaz madero family ’s male businessman ’s son educate classroom culver military academy indiana standard oil scholar later discover probably offer madero 500,000 1 million help overthrow díaz furious absence land reform return hacienda campesino zapata officer issue plan ayala november 1911 join orozco north zapatista push event new radical stage revolt rural urban working class spread accompany grow violence madero find lose support army officer remain loyal díaz strike fighting land seizure erupt madero little place general victoriano huerta charge army huerta stop zapatista come realize madero weak rule",118,"[1911, 1911]",1911,2,1925,1950

The Mexican foreign minister denied the charges and demands. Given Wilson’s intimacy with the Guggenheim mining interests, the Madero regime probably doubted the ambassador’s detachment. In 1911, as the fighting had spread, Taft had placed 20,000 troops on the border to protect property and lives inside the United States. Trying to defuse the crisis, the president dissembled by announcing that the troops were only on spring maneuvers. Given his record for using force in the Philippines, Cuba, and Nicaragua, this explanation could have been doubted, and the president found himself whiplashed between those who wanted the United States to keep its hands off Mexico and those who wanted dollars supplemented with bullets.

Knox disagreed; he mistrusted Wilson and did not want any U.S. military intervention, especially after the Taft administration was defeated in the 1912 presidential race and was a political lame duck. In February 1913 General Huerta cut a deal with the ultraconservative nephew of Díaz, Felix Díaz, and turned against Madero. Felix Díaz and Wilson were so close that the German ambassador in Mexico City wired Berlin in February: “American ambassador working openly for Díaz, told Madero in my presence he was doing so because Díaz is pro-American.” Huerta captured Madero, then asked Wilson what to do with the captive. Wilson was deeply involved; in his offices Huerta and Díaz had made the “Pact of the Embassy” to seal their new partnership. The ambassador told Huerta he must “do whatever you think best for the country.” When Madero’s wife pleaded for her husband’s safety, Wilson replied he could not interfere in a “sovereign nation’s” problems.

President-elect Woodrow Wilson would have to make that decision. Huerta lasted little more than a year; Woodrow Wilson’s pressure, climaxing with the landing of U.S. forces at Vera Cruz in 1914, helped drive him from power. Ironically, Carranza then moved to take over the country and directly challenged U.S. oil holdings.21","['little more than a year', '1914']",pro madero revolt immediately erupt north lead venustiano carranza taft tell wilson give fluid situation huerta ’s inability settle u.s property claim quickly british refusal recognize madero ’s murderer lame duck status recognition new president grant president elect woodrow wilson decision huerta last little year woodrow wilson ’s pressure climax landing u.s force vera cruz 1914 help drive power ironically carranza move country directly challenge u.s oil holdings.21,68,[1914],1914,1,1925,1950
704,"As historian John Mason Hart has observed, the “basic antagonism” in 1911–12 “was between village communalists and agricultural workers on the one side and hacendados and foreign landowners in defense of their commercial holdings on the other.” With their billion dollars’ worth of investments, U.S. citizens constituted most of those foreign landowners. They had first worked with Porfirio Díaz to transform Mexico from a largely self-sustaining nation based on a liberal 1857 constitution into a country with deepening class divisions that was dependent on exports and New York capital. (By 1912, the U.S. chargé d’affaires in Mexico City could bitterly complain of the “unintelligent demands of the proletariat.”) When Porfirio Díaz finally tried to slow down the American commercial invasion, U.S. investors, led by some of the most powerful progenitors of the new Industrial Revolution, supported Madero’s overthrow of the old dictator.","['1857', '1912']",historian john mason hart observe “ basic antagonism ” 1911–12 “ village communalist agricultural worker hacendado foreign landowner defense commercial holding ” billion dollars’ worth investment u.s citizen constitute foreign landowner work porfirio díaz transform mexico largely self sustain nation base liberal 1857 constitution country deepen class division dependent export new york capital 1912 u.s chargé d’affaire mexico city bitterly complain “ unintelligent demand proletariat ” porfirio díaz finally try slow commercial invasion u.s investor lead powerful progenitor new industrial revolution support madero ’s overthrow old dictator,87,"[1857, 1912]",1884,2,1900,1900

The 1910 outbreak, one close observer noted, “had a decidedly Boxer character … directed primarily against the … interests of the United States.”22 When Madero could neither control the rising tide of armed peasant and urban-labor protest nor bring powerful Porfirioistas to heel, Henry Lane Wilson worked with Huerta to overthrow the new president. Taft, to his credit, had withstood immense pressures and kept U.S. troops out of Mexico. But the post-1865 American quest for opportunity had helped establish the conditions in Mexico for a major twentieth-century social revolution and then, to protect those opportunities, had accelerated the revolution. The well-informed German ambassador to Washington, Count von Bernstorff, placed the episode in historical context: Taft and Henry Lane Wilson pursued “the usual American policy of replacing hostile regimes with pliable ones through revolutions without taking official responsibility for it.”23","['1907', '1910', 'post-1865', 'twentieth-century']",díaz doubly damned early long cooperation american arouse deep nationalist feeling especially 1907 panic madero exploit 1910 outbreak close observer note “ decidedly boxer character … direct primarily … interest united states.”22 madero control rise tide armed peasant urban labor protest bring powerful porfirioista heel henry lane wilson work huerta overthrow new president taft credit withstand immense pressure keep u.s troop mexico post-1865 quest opportunity help establish condition mexico major twentieth century social revolution protect opportunity accelerate revolution inform german ambassador washington count von bernstorff place episode historical context taft henry lane wilson pursue “ usual policy replace hostile regime pliable one revolution take official responsibility it.”23,107,"[1907, 1910, 1865]",1894,3,1900,1900

H. Harriman’s riches and contacts in Russia, a deal could be developed to buy the Chinese Eastern Railroad in Manchuria, which St. Petersburg controlled, use that as leverage to force Japan to sell the South Manchurian, and hence at once restore both Chinese control of all Manchuria and U.S. opportunities. Putting the plans together as the first chief of the new Division of Far Eastern Affairs in the State Department during 1908–9, Straight worked with Knox and New York bankers to prepare the offensive.

708,"Knox and Straight decided to play for it all, and they thought they had strong Chinese support. In reality, Straight’s most important supporters – Yuan Shih-k’ai and T’ang Shao-yi – had lost power in 1909, although Chinese officials continued to hope they could use the Americans to counterbalance the Europeans and Japanese. Straight, believing he also had the support of British capital, returned to Asia in 1909 to plan how a U.S. banking group could build a trans-Manchuria railroad (the Chinchow-Aigun). China agreed with his proposal. In Washington, however, Knox decided to try to expand this foothold into a play for the whole of Manchuria. His plan called for the neutralization or internationalization of all Manchurian railroads. The stunning proposal hinged on British cooperation, Russian willingness to sell the Chinese Eastern, Japan’s consent to give up the South Manchuria, and the Chinese government’s ability to hold its nation together against rising nationalism and intensified foreign pressures.","['1909', '1909']",knox straight decide play think strong chinese support reality straight ’s important supporter – yuan shih k’ai t’ang shao yi – lose power 1909 chinese official continue hope use american counterbalance europeans japanese straight believe support british capital return asia 1909 plan u.s banking group build trans manchuria railroad chinchow aigun china agree proposal washington knox decide try expand foothold play manchuria plan call neutralization internationalization manchurian railroad stunning proposal hinge british cooperation russian willingness sell chinese eastern japan ’s consent south manchuria chinese government ’s ability hold nation rise nationalism intensify foreign pressure,94,"[1909, 1909]",1909,2,1925,1950
709,"All four of these assumptions promptly collapsed. The major British interest was India, not northern China, and London was willing to allow Japan to do much as it pleased in the latter area as long as Tokyo cooperated with British policies in the former region. The Russians, for their part, had no intention of selling the essential eastern end of the Trans-Siberian Railway system, especially if they could – as they did in 1910 – combine with Japan to confirm their joint division of Manchuria and shut out the irritating Americans. Knox’s dream of checking Japan, in historian Warren Cohen’s words, “like so many dreams … failed to survive the rising sun.” On the same day (November 13, 1909) Knox proposed his plan, Japan approached Russia with the possibility of more formally dividing Manchuria. Their agreement was signed, ironically, on July 4, 1910. Determined “to forestall any arrangement between Russia and Japan,” Knox instead had driven these former enemies closer together.26","['1910 –', 'the same day', 'November 13, 1909', 'July 4, 1910']",assumption promptly collapse major british interest india northern china london willing allow japan please area long tokyo cooperate british policy region russian intention sell essential eastern end trans siberian railway system especially – 1910 – combine japan confirm joint division manchuria shut irritate american knox ’s dream check japan historian warren cohen ’s word “ like dream … fail survive rise sun ” day november 13 1909 knox propose plan japan approach russia possibility formally divide manchuria agreement sign ironically july 4 1910 determine “ forestall arrangement russia japan ” knox instead drive enemy closer together.26,96,"[1910, 1909, 1910]",1910,3,1925,1950
710,"But the collapse of Knox’s and Straight’s final assumption proved most important. Blocked from Manchuria, Taft pressured a European Consortium, formed to build railways in China, to admit U.S. capital. The Europeans objected because admitting the Americans would inevitably lead to Japan and Russia demanding membership in the consortium. Taft prevailed. So did the Russians and Japanese. The president now found himself as one of six allied foreign imperialists embarked upon building the Wuhan-Canton and Wuhan-Chengdu railways. Since the 1890s, and especially since the Boxers had shown the military importance of railways, a “rights-recovery” movement had grown to demand that only Chinese capital and engineers build the vital lines. The consortium’s move, and the Qing’s cooperation, triggered antiforeign protests in mid-1911 that quickly spread and received the support of highly nationalist officers of the reformed Chinese Army. Missionaries were again targeted; a mob murdered eight members of a British Baptist group in Hankow.","['the 1890s', 'Qing', 'mid-1911']",collapse knox ’s straight ’s final assumption prove important block manchuria taft pressure european consortium form build railway china admit u.s capital europeans object admit american inevitably lead japan russia demand membership consortium taft prevail russian japanese president find ally foreign imperialist embark build wuhan canton wuhan chengdu railway 1890s especially boxer show military importance railway “ right recovery ” movement grow demand chinese capital engineer build vital line consortium ’s qing ’s cooperation trigger antiforeign protest mid-1911 quickly spread receive support highly nationalist officer reform chinese army missionary target mob murder member british baptist group hankow,97,"[1890, 1911]",1900,2,1925,1950
711,"In 1912, the key leader of the reform movement, Sun Yat-sen, formed the Kuomintang (KMT). Knowing the United States well, and claiming that the KMT drew inspiration in part from American institutions, Sun directly asked for Washington’s support. Taft and Knox were not interested. They mistrusted the KMT, liked the strong hand that Yuan wielded, and believed he could best protect U.S. and other foreign claims in China. The two U.S. officials, in the spirit of William Seward, also wanted to present a solid front with the other powers to protect foreign claims, as well as to prevent the Chinese from playing their traditional policy of countering foreigner with foreigner. The powers sided with the authoritarian Yuan. President Woodrow Wilson remained with Yuan. After the dictator’s death in 1916, U.S. officials watched helplessly as the KMT took China into its post-1919 revolution. To Taft, Knox, and Wilson, Yuan seemed a good choice to serve some of the same functions as the new U.S. presidency served in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America: After Western and Japanese capital acted as a trigger for Chinese nationalism and antiforeign outbreaks, Yuan was to restore order and preserve such foreign claims as the Open Door.28","['1912', '1916']",1912 key leader reform movement sun yat sen form kuomintang kmt know united state claim kmt draw inspiration institution sun directly ask washington ’s support taft knox interested mistrust kmt like strong hand yuan wield believe best protect u.s foreign claim china u.s official spirit william seward want present solid power protect foreign claim prevent chinese play traditional policy counter foreigner foreigner power side authoritarian yuan president woodrow wilson remain yuan dictator ’s death 1916 u.s official watch helplessly kmt take china post-1919 revolution taft knox wilson yuan good choice serve function new u.s presidency serve caribbean mexico central america western japanese capital act trigger chinese nationalism antiforeign outbreak yuan restore order preserve foreign claim open door.28,117,"[1912, 1916]",1914,2,1925,1950
712,"The alternative to the Taft-Knox policy was outlined by an angry Roosevelt in a letter to Taft in late 1910. Roosevelt, resembling most Westerners, had little sense of how the foreign pressures were accelerating the disintegration of the already undermined Qing, and how the powers’ constant intervention provided a focal point for the antiforeign protests of the rights-recovery movement and other nationalists. TR had, however, learned the hard way about Japanese power, and he told Taft that Manchuria and Korea were vital interests of the Japanese. “We cannot interfere in those areas unless we have an army as good as Germany’s or a navy as good as Britain’s.

713,"Roosevelt was perhaps more pleased with one footnote to Taft’s policies. Although the pogroms had largely stopped by 1906, Russia continued to refuse to recognize the U.S. passports of Jews, Roman Catholic priests, and Protestant ministers. Led by Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb, demands grew that Taft retaliate by abrogating the 1832 treaty regulating U.S.-Russian trade. The president, as usual, moved slowly, but the House of Representatives, with only one dissenting vote, resolved to end the pact. Taft then informed St. Petersburg that the treaty had to be terminated, although he hoped a new agreement would replace it. The two governments never wrote such an agreement, and American-Russian relations continued their long, post-1867 decline.","['1906', '1832']",roosevelt pleased footnote taft ’s policy pogrom largely stop 1906 russia continue refuse recognize u.s passport jews roman catholic priest protestant minister lead jacob schiff kuhn loeb demand grow taft retaliate abrogate 1832 treaty regulate u.s .- russian trade president usual move slowly house representative dissent vote resolve end pact taft inform st petersburg treaty terminate hop new agreement replace government write agreement russian relation continue long post-1867 decline,69,"[1906, 1832]",1869,2,1875,1900
714,"The globalizing of America started long before 1913. As we trace the history of U.S. foreign relations from 1913 to 1945, it is important to recall that the nation had come into existence and conducted its external affairs in a world in which technological and economic globalization had begun to connect different parts of the globe. The main agents of this transformation had been Europe and North America, comprising much of the “West” that had come to dominate the rest of the world (the “non-West”) not only economically but also militarily, politically, and even culturally. We should not lose sight of the non-West, however, even when we consider American foreign relations in the framework of globalization. After all, until at least the second half of the eighteenth century, the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East and the Chinese Empire in East Asia had been centers of wealth, power, and influence. In fact, as the European nation-states fought one another almost without interruption throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a dispassionate observer might have predicted that those states would soon exhaust themselves and that the more unified empires of the Middle East and East Asia – collectively known as Asia, the Orient, or the East – might in the long run prove much more important determinants of world affairs.","['1913', '1913', '1945', 'at least the second half of the eighteenth century', 'the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries']",globalizing america start long 1913 trace history u.s foreign relation 1913 1945 important recall nation come existence conduct external affair world technological economic globalization begin connect different part globe main agent transformation europe north america comprise “ west ” come dominate rest world “ non west ” economically militarily politically culturally lose sight non west consider foreign relation framework globalization second half eighteenth century ottoman empire middle east chinese empire east asia center wealth power influence fact european nation state fight interruption seventeenth eighteenth century dispassionate observer predict state soon exhaust unified empire middle east east asia – collectively know asia orient east – long run prove important determinant world affair,111,"[1913, 1913, 1945]",1924,3,1925,1950
715,"As William McNeill, Paul Kennedy, Christopher Bayly, and others have shown, however, toward the end of the eighteenth century, the West and the non-West began to diverge to such an extent that, whereas in 1800 the world’s economic wealth was more or less evenly distributed in various parts of the globe, a hundred years later the West had come to account for, and dominate, the bulk of it.1 In part this was because in Europe the nation-state was in a virtually constant state of war or of war preparedness and had to develop a centralized administrative structure for mobilizing armed forces and collecting taxes to pay for them. These, which John Brewer has termed the “sinews of power,” were systematically developed by the European monarchies throughout the seventeenth century, and during the following century the struggle for power among the nation-states came to define the basic nature of European international relations.2 Concepts of “great power,” “balance of power,” and “reason of state” were developed as guides to national policy, justifying domestic and external measures for the enhancement of each state’s relative power.","['the end of the eighteenth century', '1800', 'a hundred years later', 'the seventeenth century', 'the following century']",william mcneill paul kennedy christopher bayly show end eighteenth century west non west begin diverge extent 1800 world ’s economic wealth evenly distribute part globe year later west come account dominate bulk it.1 europe nation state virtually constant state war war preparedness develop centralized administrative structure mobilize armed force collect tax pay john brewer term “ sinew power ” systematically develop european monarchy seventeenth century following century struggle power nation state come define basic nature european international relations.2 concept “ great power “ balance power ” “ reason state ” develop guide national policy justify domestic external measure enhancement state ’s relative power,103,[1800],1800,1,1825,1850
716,"To return to the observation made at the outset, it is important to note that the United States emerged on the world stage as it was being molded by the military, economic, and cultural developments in Europe. They provided the point of departure for the young nation’s foreign and domestic affairs. Its very existence as an independent republic was aided by the European military rivalries, in particular the French-British struggle for power. The Founders took it for granted that if the nation were to protect its independence, it would have to be prepared for war, which would necessitate military force and a bureaucracy to pay for and administer it. Furthermore, national power would be enhanced through territorial expansion and the removal of potential threats nearer home. All these objectives were pursued by the U.S. government, formally established under the Constitution in 1787.",['1787'],return observation outset important note united state emerge world stage mold military economic cultural development europe provide point departure young nation ’s foreign domestic affair existence independent republic aid european military rivalry particular french british struggle power founder take grant nation protect independence prepare war necessitate military force bureaucracy pay administer furthermore national power enhance territorial expansion removal potential threat nearer home objective pursue u.s government formally establish constitution 1787,70,[1787],1787,1,1800,1800
717,"It is all the more remarkable, therefore, that outside of Europe Americans continued to expand their activities and interests – as part of the expansion of the West in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. America’s own industrialization began during the War of 1812 against England, although it would pick up momentum only after the Civil War. In the meantime, it was in trade and shipping that the Americans excelled; their ships were almost as numerous as British, prying open new markets in the Middle East and East Asia and establishing connections with the newly independent states of Latin America. Clearly, such activities added to the wealth of individual Americans, but whether they also augmented national power on the whole was in question in the absence of domestic unity. In the middle of the century, the United States was already being recognized as a would-be economic giant, but that did not translate into making the nation a formidable player in world affairs. In the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America, where “informal empire” held sway – ad hoc systems of control exercised by the West over indigenous peoples for facilitating trade – the American presence was conspicuous.7 That such informal empire might have brought about an enhancement of American influence in the global picture could be seen in Commodore Matthew Perry’s expeditions to Japan, undertaken in 1853 and 1854. It was a dramatic moment, revealing America’s emergence as a Pacific power. Perry himself had visions of the United States holding sway over the western Pacific. Such visions had no way of becoming realized while the nation grew steadily divided. It should be noted, however, that at this time few European nations were intent upon systematically extending territorial control, apart from economic interests, in other parts of the globe. In this sense, too, America was still part of the West.","['the middle of the century', '1853', '1854']",remarkable outside europe american continue expand activity interest – expansion west wake industrial revolution america ’s industrialization begin war 1812 england pick momentum civil war meantime trade shipping american excel ship numerous british pry open new market middle east east asia establish connection newly independent state latin america clearly activity add wealth individual american augment national power question absence domestic unity middle century united state recognize economic giant translate make nation formidable player world affair middle east asia latin america “ informal empire ” hold sway – ad hoc system control exercise west indigenous people facilitate trade – presence conspicuous.7 informal empire bring enhancement influence global picture see commodore matthew perry ’s expedition japan undertake 1853 1854 dramatic moment reveal america ’s emergence pacific power perry vision united state hold sway western pacific vision way realize nation grow steadily divide note time european nation intent systematically extend territorial control apart economic interest part globe sense america west,157,"[1853, 1854]",1854,2,1875,1900
718,"American culture in the nineteenth century was part of the broader Western civilization in that these European ideas had their counterparts in the United States. Not all of these ideas were taken with the same degree of seriousness; romanticism was most conspicuous among Southern sectionalists, and socialist experiments in the Midwest. But theories of race differences were virtually universally accepted. By the 1840s, apart from a tiny minority who believed in complete racial equality, Americans in all parts of the world had come to take the superiority of the white race for granted.8 In this respect, too, they belonged to the same universe as Europeans. Americans were Westerners, culturally as well as economically, and the temporary passivity of U.S. foreign affairs, induced by growing domestic tensions, did not alter the equation.","['the nineteenth century', 'the 1840s']",culture nineteenth century broad western civilization european idea counterpart united state idea take degree seriousness romanticism conspicuous southern sectionalist socialist experiment midwest theory race difference virtually universally accept 1840s apart tiny minority believe complete racial equality american part world come superiority white race granted.8 respect belong universe europeans american westerner culturally economically temporary passivity u.s foreign affair induce grow domestic tension alter equation,63,[1840],1840,1,1850,1850

A modern state was a greater power than its earlier manifestation in that it possessed nationalized mass armed forces equipped with ever newer weapons and because the state itself, rather than a monarchy or an aristocratic order, was the focus of loyalty. Above all, the modern state benefited from, and in turn promoted, rapid technological advances. By the 1870s, innovations such as the telegraph and the telephone had begun to facilitate long-distance communication, contributing immeasurably to a nation’s political, military, and economic integration. Electricity freed humans to organize themselves more easily than in the past for social and cultural activities. Railroads had already enabled people in different areas of a country to come closer, and now steam-propelled ships were taking them to all corners of the earth.","['the seventeenth century', 'the 1870s']",modern state characterize centralized administration armed force secular public authority institution define limit acceptable behavior people boundary mass participation political process unify domestic market system production distribution extensive network transportation communication legal code distinguish citizen foreigner – state outgrowth early nation state come existence seventeenth century modern state build society cohesive integrate far great segment population entity modern state great power early manifestation possess nationalize mass armed force equip new weapon state monarchy aristocratic order focus loyalty modern state benefit turn promote rapid technological advance 1870s innovation telegraph telephone begin facilitate long distance communication contribute immeasurably nation ’s political military economic integration electricity free human organize easily past social cultural activity railroad enable people different area country come closer steam propel ship take corner earth,125,[1870],1870,1,1875,1900
721,"As a newly reunified modern state, the United States shared many features with the modern states of Europe. Although, after 1865, the nation was led by politicians whose stature did not match Germany’s Otto von Bismarck or Britain’s William Gladstone, the authority of the federal government in upholding domestic order was unquestioned. It had at its disposal U.S. armed forces and “national guards,” or state-level military units. Although much smaller in scale than continental European forces, they were steadily modernized to cope with possible crises overseas. It is true that prior to the 1890s American military power was less conspicuous than most European countries’; during the Cuban crisis of 1868–78, when the island’s rebels turned to the United States for support, Washington refused to act for fear that the nation might become involved in a war with Spain, which then was considered superior militarily to the United States. But it was only a matter of time before the latter would catch up, and indeed in 1898 it fought a highly successful war against Spain.","['1865', '1890s', '1898']",newly reunify modern state united state share feature modern state europe 1865 nation lead politician stature match germany ’s otto von bismarck britain ’s william gladstone authority federal government uphold domestic order unquestioned disposal u.s armed force “ national guard ” state level military unit small scale continental european force steadily modernize cope possible crisis overseas true prior 1890s military power conspicuous european countries’ cuban crisis 1868–78 island ’s rebel turn united state support washington refuse act fear nation involved war spain consider superior militarily united state matter time catch 1898 fight highly successful war spain,96,"[1865, 1890, 1898]",1884,3,1900,1900
722,"In another area American power also lagged behind European: overseas colonization. In Europe it came to be taken for granted, from the 1870s onward, that a great power acquired overseas possessions both to demonstrate that it was a great power and also because colonies, bases, and spheres of influence were considered to be major assets that augmented the nation’s resources and made more effective its strategic position in world affairs. The United States was slow to join the trend. To the country’s leaders, distant lands in Africa, the Middle East, or Asia held little attraction beyond offering markets. But even here, over four-fifths of American trade was carried on with European countries, and there was no pressing need to establish enclaves of special interests abroad. It was not that the United States was unconcerned with developments outside of Europe, especially after the 1880s when the great powers began in earnest the process of dividing up Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia and the Pacific Ocean into their respective spheres of influence. For the time being, however, the United States emulated the European powers only in Hawaii, which was turned into a virtual protectorate in 1876 when the two countries signed a treaty binding the Hawaiian monarchy to refrain from leasing its ports to any other power and establishing a reciprocity arrangement regarding trade.","['the 1870s onward', 'the 1880s', '1876']",area power lag european overseas colonization europe come take grant 1870s onward great power acquire overseas possession demonstrate great power colony base sphere influence consider major asset augment nation ’s resource effective strategic position world affair united state slow join trend country ’s leader distant land africa middle east asia hold little attraction offer market fifth trade carry european country press need establish enclave special interest abroad united state unconcerned development outside europe especially 1880s great power begin earnest process divide africa middle east part asia pacific ocean respective sphere influence time united state emulate european power hawaii turn virtual protectorate 1876 country sign treaty bind hawaiian monarchy refrain lease port power establish reciprocity arrangement trade,116,"[1870, 1880, 1876]",1875,3,1900,1900

724,"One can see this not only in military and territorial affairs but also, and particularly, in American economic resources and performance. Already at the turn of the century, America’s manufacturing output was second only to Britain’s, and America’s rapid industrialization was reflected in the relative rise in importance of the areas outside of Europe for its export trade. The policy of the Open Door, or a call upon other countries to keep their domestic markets open to foreign commerce, which was first promulgated in 1899, signaled the U.S. government’s concern with participating in the trade of less industrialized parts of the world. Foreign investment was another example. Although the nation continued to obtain funds for its industrialization from Europe, especially Britain, American financiers increasingly turned their attention to investment opportunities in less developed areas of the globe, such as Mexico and China. It is no accident that at first they concentrated on railway development in these countries. More miles of railways (182,000) had been built in the United States than anywhere else, and the Americans were convinced that by building more railways in Latin America, Asia, and possibly even the Middle East, they could develop these lands and turn them into huge markets for American goods. Establishing global linkages to the American economy impressed the political and business leaders as essential to the health of the domestic political and social system.","['the turn of the century', '1899']","military territorial affair particularly economic resource performance turn century america ’s manufacturing output second britain ’s america ’s rapid industrialization reflect relative rise importance area outside europe export trade policy open door country domestic market open foreign commerce promulgate 1899 signal u.s government ’s concern participate trade industrialized part world foreign investment example nation continue obtain fund industrialization europe especially britain financier increasingly turn attention investment opportunity developed area globe mexico china accident concentrate railway development country mile railway 182,000 build united state american convince build railway latin america asia possibly middle east develop land turn huge market good establish global linkage economy impress political business leader essential health domestic political social system",113,[1899],1899,1,1900,1900
725,"This does not mean, however, that Americans simply followed their European cousins in conceptualizing international affairs. One important development in the several years before the outbreak of the Great War in 1914 was the growing self-confidence with which American leaders in and out of government came to argue for their nation’s special role in, or unique contribution to, the world. One may point to two particularly significant formulations: President William Howard Taft’s “dollar diplomacy” and his and others’ espousal of world peace through international law.","['the several years', '1914']",mean american simply follow european cousin conceptualize international affair important development year outbreak great war 1914 grow self confidence leader government come argue nation ’s special role unique contribution world point particularly significant formulation president william howard taft ’s “ dollar diplomacy ” others’ espousal world peace international law,49,[1914],1914,1,1925,1950

727,"The coming of the Great War had little or nothing directly to do with the United States. It was a culmination of complex intra-European conflicts that had at least five dimensions: the French-German contention over Alsace-Lorraine, the German-Russia competition for control of the Middle East (as well as the traditional antagonism between tsarist Russia and the Ottoman Empire), the Balkan crisis brought about by efforts of various nationality groups to assert their independence of the Austro-Hungarian Empire or of the Ottoman Empire, the German-British rivalry over naval expansion, and the general colonial disputes.1 In none of these conflicts had the United States been directly involved. Its military power had grown considerably, and it had come to possess an overseas empire. But its presence in global geopolitical affairs had been primarily confined to the Caribbean and the Pacific, even though it had developed extensive economic and ideological influences throughout the world. The very fact that war broke out in Europe and quickly spread to the Middle East without any sense of American involvement revealed that, much as the United States had begun to make itself conspicuous on the global stage, its mere existence and power alone were insufficient to prevent a major catastrophe in international affairs. As the great powers of Europe (as well as the Ottoman Empire) one after another mobilized for war in the last days of July 1914, and as they formally began fighting against one another in August – Britain, France, and Russia on one side, and Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey on the other – the United States recoiled in disbelief, incredulous that the civilized nations should thus stumble into fratricide but, all the same, relieved that at least the American people were spared the tragedy.","['the last days of July 1914', 'August –']",coming great war little directly united state culmination complex intra european conflict dimension french german contention alsace lorraine german russia competition control middle east traditional antagonism tsarist russia ottoman empire balkan crisis bring effort nationality group assert independence austro hungarian empire ottoman empire german british rivalry naval expansion general colonial disputes.1 conflict united state directly involve military power grow considerably come possess overseas empire presence global geopolitical affair primarily confine caribbean pacific develop extensive economic ideological influence world fact war break europe quickly spread middle east sense involvement reveal united state begin conspicuous global stage mere existence power insufficient prevent major catastrophe international affair great power europe ottoman empire mobilize war day july 1914 formally begin fight august – britain france russia germany austria hungary turkey – united state recoil disbelief incredulous civilized nation stumble fratricide relieve people spar tragedy,140,[1914],1914,1,1925,1950
728,"Even so, initially Europeans no less than Americans believed the unfortunate conflict would be of short duration, that the troops would be coming home by Christmas. There had been no general European war since 1815, when the Napoleonic wars, which had lasted for more than twenty years, had at last ended, and in the meantime there had grown a strong sense of international fraternity and interdependence. Cosmopolitanism – the idea that what divided nations was of far less importance than what united them – had grown, abetted by economic globalization and cultural interchange among “civilized” powers. Internationalism, as many believed, had grown stronger than nationalism, and civilization more enduring than barbarism. Many had become convinced that modern civilization was incompatible with warfare. Americans had heartily concurred in such ideas. But when the war did not end speedily, it became more and more gruesome, in the process abetting extreme nationalism in all combatants. At sea the British and German navies engaged in deathly conflict, especially after 1915, when the German navy began employing submarines, while on land French and German soldiers endured months of trench warfare starting in 1915 in which they dug deep tunnels and sought to advance slowly to the enemy camp. Russian forces, more numerous than those of any other belligerent, fought against Germans and Austrians in the west and Turks in the south. All such military encounters proved indecisive – until the United States became a factor, first as a neutral and then as a participant in the war.","['Christmas', '1815', 'more than twenty years', '1915', 'months', '1915']",initially europeans american believe unfortunate conflict short duration troop come home christmas general european war 1815 napoleonic war last year end meantime grow strong sense international fraternity interdependence cosmopolitanism – idea divide nation far importance unite – grow abet economic globalization cultural interchange “ civilized ” power internationalism believe grow strong nationalism civilization enduring barbarism convinced modern civilization incompatible warfare americans heartily concur idea war end speedily gruesome process abet extreme nationalism combatant sea british german navy engage deathly conflict especially 1915 german navy begin employ submarine land french german soldier endure month trench warfare start 1915 dig deep tunnel seek advance slowly enemy camp russian force numerous belligerent fight german austrian west turk south military encounter prove indecisive – united state factor neutral participant war,126,"[1815, 1915, 1915]",1882,3,1900,1900
729,"The government in Washington under President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the nation’s neutrality as soon as war came. Although some, notably former president Theodore Roosevelt, warned that the war would alter the global balance of power and thus could not but affect the security of the nation, initially, at least, this did not seem to be the case. As the German forces sped across the western front to conquer Belgium and marched on to the heart of France, German and British ships exchanged fire in the North Sea, and Russian and Turkish troops confronted each other in the Black Sea region, there was little concern that whatever happened in Europe or on Middle East soil would immediately involve the United States. The only possible threat in the summer of 1914 lay in Asia, where Japan, which had emerged as a rival of the United States, seized upon its alliance with Britain, declared war on Germany, and proceeded to drive Germans out of China (Shandong – or Shantung – Peninsula) and the western Pacific (the Carolines, the Marianas, and the Marshalls). Some naval strategists in Hawaii and Washington were alarmed, but President Woodrow Wilson was not. He, in fact, had forbidden the navy to undertake hypothetical war planning against Japan. He was not unaware of sources of conflict with Japan, especially the immigration dispute on the West Coast, but he did not believe the two countries were potential enemies at this time. The Japanese occupation of Shandong province and the German islands in the Pacific was viewed with essential equanimity. Events in Asia would not affect American neutrality in Europe.","['the summer of 1914', '–']",government washington president woodrow wilson proclaim nation ’s neutrality soon war come notably president theodore roosevelt warn war alter global balance power affect security nation initially case german force speed western conquer belgium march heart france german british ship exchange fire north sea russian turkish troop confront black sea region little concern happen europe middle east soil immediately involve united state possible threat summer 1914 lie asia japan emerge rival united state seize alliance britain declare war germany proceed drive german china shandong – shantung – peninsula western pacific caroline marianas marshall naval strategist hawaii washington alarm president woodrow wilson fact forbid navy undertake hypothetical war plan japan unaware source conflict japan especially immigration dispute west coast believe country potential enemy time japanese occupation shandong province german island pacific view essential equanimity event asia affect neutrality europe,137,[1914],1914,1,1925,1950

731,"Such broad agreement was no guarantee that the rights of a neutral nation would be respected, however, for all belligerents sought to restrict those rights lest they should benefit the enemy side. Britain made this quite clear when it defined contraband very broadly in order to stop shipments from the United States to Germany of all but obviously nonmilitary goods such as food and medicine. After March 1915, moreover, the British navy was authorized to stop all goods destined for Germany through the institution of a blockade. Blockading the enemy coast was acceptable in international law so long as it was effective; the belligerent power establishing it must not simply declare a blockade but must use its force to divert ships entering the blockaded area to other destinations. The cargoes of such ships would be detained or paid for as compensation. However, as neutral (e.g., U.S.) goods could reach Germany through another neutral port (for instance, in Sweden), Britain forbade such practice (“continuous voyages”) and stopped American contraband from reaching neutral destinations.",['March 1915'],broad agreement guarantee right neutral nation respect belligerent seek restrict right lest benefit enemy britain clear define contraband broadly order stop shipment united state germany obviously nonmilitary good food medicine march 1915 british navy authorize stop good destine germany institution blockade blockade enemy coast acceptable international law long effective belligerent power establish simply declare blockade use force divert ship enter blockade area destination cargo ship detain pay compensation neutral e.g. u.s good reach germany neutral port instance sweden britain forbid practice “ continuous voyage ” stop contraband reach neutral destination,90,[1915],1915,1,1925,1950
732,"Predictably, these strong measures provoked countermeasures by Germany. To deny Britain and its allies their advantages at sea, the German navy began, in 1915, employing U-boats or submarines against enemy warships and other categories of vessels. Existing international law did not explicitly forbid submarine warfare (unlike poison gas, whose use had been declared illegal in 1899 at the International Peace Conference at The Hague), although there was considerable murkiness as to whether it was lawful for a submarine to fire at an enemy merchant ship without warning. In any event, the U-boat campaign had immediate implications for the United States as the rights of Americans to travel on nonmilitary belligerent ships would be compromised.2","['1915', '1899']",predictably strong measure provoke countermeasure germany deny britain ally advantage sea german navy begin 1915 employ u boat submarine enemy warship category vessel exist international law explicitly forbid submarine warfare unlike poison gas use declare illegal 1899 international peace conference hague considerable murkiness lawful submarine fire enemy merchant ship warn event u boat campaign immediate implication united state right american travel nonmilitary belligerent ship compromised.2,65,"[1915, 1899]",1907,2,1925,1950
733,"Thus, by its very decision to remain neutral, the United States found itself becoming part of the European conflict as well as a key agent for the preservation of an economically networked world. The belligerents were forced to balance their strategic needs with diplomatic considerations toward the United States. Both Britain and Germany were determined to avoid a serious crisis with Washington even as they carried on their fierce war at sea. But it was very difficult to do so. Britain, for instance, tried to mollify American opinion by exempting cotton from the list of embargoed goods. But this did not prevent serious disputes between the two countries. Washington and London exchanged many notes during 1914 and 1915, the former protesting against Britain’s infringement on neutral rights and the latter justifying its action on legal grounds. The disagreement between the two positions was virtually irreconcilable, amounting to divergent attitudes toward globalization in wartime, and might have led to a grave crisis but for other circumstances.","['1914', '1915']",decision remain neutral united state find european conflict key agent preservation economically networked world belligerent force balance strategic need diplomatic consideration united state britain germany determine avoid crisis washington carry fierce war sea difficult britain instance try mollify opinion exempt cotton list embargoed good prevent dispute country washington london exchange note 1914 1915 protesting britain ’s infringement neutral right justify action legal ground disagreement position virtually irreconcilable amount divergent attitude globalization wartime lead grave crisis circumstance,76,"[1914, 1915]",1914,2,1925,1950
734,"One was the nature of American opinion, official and at large. President Wilson, to be sure, declared on a number of occasions that the nation must maintain its neutrality in thought and behavior. The war, he repeatedly told his countrymen, was a European affair involving disputes over matters about which the United States was not concerned. At the same time, however, in private conversations and correspondence he did not conceal his sympathies with Britain. As a political science scholar and as a practicing politician, he had looked on the British system of government as an exemplary form of democracy, which he considered was being challenged by German autocracy.3 Many advisers around him – Colonel Edward House, Robert Lansing (secretary of state after May 1915), and others – were outspoken supporters of the British side in the war, as were highly vocal public figures such as Theodore Roosevelt and presidents of prestigious East Coast universities. Their pro-allied sentiment was reinforced by a highly effective propaganda campaign organized in London. Through its diplomats and other agents (the most successful of them was Sir William Wiseman, who established his headquarters in New York and kept in close touch with prominent Americans), the British government disseminated anti-German propaganda, fed high officials in Washington confidential information that was favorable to the allies, and sought to influence local opinion by contacting newspaper editors. The Germans, of course, were by no means inactive. They too organized public relations networks to incite anti-British sentiment, especially in rural areas and small towns with sizable populations of German background. A large number of them, as well as those of Irish origin, insisted that the nation should maintain strict neutrality in the war. Few of them advocated outright support of Germany, but many were opposed to any action on the part of the United States that benefited Britain and its allies. The influence of pro-German opinion would have remained strong and might even have grown if America’s dispute had been confined to Britain.4",['May 1915'],nature opinion official large president wilson sure declare number occasion nation maintain neutrality thought behavior war repeatedly tell countryman european affair involve dispute matter united state concern time private conversation correspondence conceal sympathy britain political science scholar practice politician look british system government exemplary form democracy consider challenge german autocracy.3 adviser – colonel edward house robert lansing secretary state 1915 – outspoken supporter british war highly vocal public figure theodore roosevelt president prestigious east coast university pro ally sentiment reinforce highly effective propaganda campaign organize london diplomat agent successful sir william wiseman establish headquarters new york keep close touch prominent american british government disseminate anti german propaganda feed high official washington confidential information favorable ally seek influence local opinion contact newspaper editor german course mean inactive organize public relation network incite anti british sentiment especially rural area small town sizable population german background large number irish origin insist nation maintain strict neutrality war advocate outright support germany oppose action united state benefit britain ally influence pro german opinion remain strong grow america ’s dispute confine britain.4,176,[1915],1915,1,1925,1950
735,"Starting in 1915, however, the assertion of American neutral rights came to involve Germany as much as Britain when Berlin commenced its U-boat campaign, against not only warships but also nonmilitary freighters and passenger liners. One dramatic incident occurred in May 1915 when the Lusitania, a British ocean liner with American travelers aboard, was sunk, with the loss of 128 American lives. The public was incensed, as this was a clear violation of what the American people believed to be one of their fundamental rights. Washington immediately fired off a stiff protest, holding Germany strictly accountable for further loss of American lives and infringement on neutral rights. Alarmed at the possibility of driving the United States to the other side, Berlin quickly expressed its regrets over the affair and pledged to exercise more caution in dealing with American lives.","['1915', 'May 1915']",start 1915 assertion neutral right come involve germany britain berlin commence u boat campaign warship nonmilitary freighter passenger liner dramatic incident occur 1915 lusitania british ocean liner traveler aboard sink loss 128 life public incense clear violation people believe fundamental right washington immediately fire stiff protest hold germany strictly accountable loss life infringement neutral right alarm possibility drive united state berlin quickly express regret affair pledge exercise caution deal life,70,"[1915, 1915]",1915,2,1925,1950
736,"Finally, despite the acrimonious debate over neutral rights, economically the United States became tied almost exclusively to the British side in the war. In theory, of course, neutral trade would have involved the nation in trade with all belligerents, but given the blockade of the Continent, little could reach Germany. Britain, on the other hand, freely obtained from America what it and its allies needed, especially arms and munitions. Altogether some $2.2 billion of arms were sold by the United States to Britain and its allies between August 1914 and March 1917, the period of American neutrality, a considerable sum when one recalls that the export of U.S. merchandise in 1913 had amounted to a little over $2.4 billion. Such large shipments – and, of course, other items such as iron, steel, and foodstuffs were also sent to Britain in increasing quantities – could not be paid for by the latter through its own exports to the United States or through the transfer of gold. (All belligerents embargoed the export of gold, thus effectively putting an end to the gold standard, which had sustained world commercial globalization since the last decades of the nineteenth century.) Nor were British assets in the United States sufficient to cover the costs. At first, short-term credits of six months’ duration and then, when the war did not end, longer-term credits had to be extended to British purchasers of American goods. These credits amounted to loans provided by American bankers, and Wilson and Bryan initially were uneasy about the possible implications of this for the nation’s neutrality. But they ultimately supported the financial transactions, because without them wartime trade could not be carried out and globalization would suffer a further decline.","['between August 1914 and March 1917', '1913', '–', 'the last decades of the nineteenth century']",finally despite acrimonious debate neutral right economically united state tie exclusively british war theory course neutral trade involve nation trade belligerent give blockade continent little reach germany britain hand freely obtain america ally need especially arm munition altogether 2.2 billion arm sell united state britain ally august 1914 march 1917 period neutrality considerable sum recall export u.s merchandise 1913 amount little 2.4 billion large shipment – course item iron steel foodstuff send britain increase quantity – pay export united state transfer gold belligerent embargo export gold effectively put end gold standard sustain world commercial globalization decade nineteenth century british asset united state sufficient cover cost short term credit months’ duration war end long term credit extend british purchaser good credit amount loan provide banker wilson bryan initially uneasy possible implication nation ’s neutrality ultimately support financial transaction wartime trade carry globalization suffer decline,143,[1913],1913,1,1925,1950
737,"It was a step from such thought to the idea that the nation should not simply engage in neutral commercial activities to ensure the survival of the global economy but also try to use its newly gained power and influence to help bring the European war to an end. Not through entering the war as a belligerent but through some constructive mediatory role could the United States make a worthy contribution to world affairs. That would be the most satisfying way the nation could utilize its resources and influence. Precisely because the European war’s origins had had nothing to do with the United States, the latter would be in a position to offer its good offices to the belligerents. Thus already in early 1915 Wilson dispatched his top confidant, Edward House, to England, France, and Germany on a peace mission to ascertain these powers’ interest in a mediated end to the hostilities. Wilson’s and House’s thinking at this time did not go much beyond restoring the prewar international order, coupled with some reduction of armaments and the reestablishment of a regime of global economic interdependence.6",['early 1915'],step thought idea nation simply engage neutral commercial activity ensure survival global economy try use newly gain power influence help bring european war end enter war belligerent constructive mediatory role united state worthy contribution world affair satisfying way nation utilize resource influence precisely european war ’s origin united state position offer good office belligerent early 1915 wilson dispatch confidant edward house england france germany peace mission ascertain powers’ interest mediate end hostility wilson ’s house ’s thinking time restore prewar international order couple reduction armament reestablishment regime global economic interdependence.6,90,[1915],1915,1,1925,1950
738,"Unfortunately, nothing came of the House mission; he was told in London that Britain would accept a peace only if it meant the destruction of German militarism. Not discouraged, Wilson tried again in 1916, sending House back to the European capitals. This time, however, House would not just offer America’s good offices or sound out the thinking of the belligerent governments but would actually summon them to a peace conference. The United States would invite both sides to attend the conference, where it would specify certain conditions for peace. It is indicative of much thinking that had gone on in Washington that the 1916 House mission went far beyond postulating the restoration of the status quo ante bellum, as had been the case in 1915. Now House (and, of course, Wilson) spoke of the German cession of Alsace and Lorraine to France, and of Constantinople to Russia – terms that clearly favored the allied side. Equally important was the proposal for the establishment of an international organization to ensure the postwar world order. The idea had emerged among certain leaders, such as former president William Howard Taft, who had begun calling for the creation of “a league to enforce peace.” (The British foreign secretary, Edward Grey, also advocated a similar idea.) Wilson wanted to make the idea his own and likewise began urging the establishment of some such organization after the war. Taft, Wilson, and other advocates of the idea believed that merely to restore the prewar status quo would bring the world back to where it had been in 1914 and would have solved nothing. Another war would most surely break out. What was needed was a new world organization to replace the traditional mechanism of balance of power. With prominent Republicans and Democrats supporting such a proposal, the new Wilsonian initiative might well have served to signal America’s emergence as the arbiter of the European conflict without itself becoming involved in the fighting.","['1916', '1916', '1915', '1914']",unfortunately come house mission tell london britain accept peace mean destruction german militarism discourage wilson try 1916 send house european capital time house offer america ’s good office sound thinking belligerent government actually summon peace conference united state invite side attend conference specify certain condition peace indicative thinking go washington 1916 house mission go far postulate restoration status quo ante bellum case 1915 house course wilson speak german cession alsace lorraine france constantinople russia – term clearly favor ally equally important proposal establishment international organization ensure postwar world order idea emerge certain leader president william howard taft begin call creation “ league enforce peace british foreign secretary edward grey advocate similar idea wilson want idea likewise begin urge establishment organization war taft wilson advocate idea believe merely restore prewar status quo bring world 1914 solve war surely break need new world organization replace traditional mechanism balance power prominent republican democrats support proposal new wilsonian initiative serve signal america ’s emergence arbiter european conflict involved fighting,165,"[1916, 1916, 1915, 1914]",1915,4,1925,1950
739,"The European governments, however, were not yet ready for the American initiative. To be sure, Britain, France, and Germany – the three countries visited by House in 1916 – did not flatly turn down Wilson’s offer of mediation. To do so would have antagonized the United States, so their leaders listened to House and expressed a willingness to explore the possibility of a negotiated peace. Berlin, in particular, sought to embarrass the British and the French by agreeing to let the United States proceed with the peace efforts. Underneath, however, the German navy was planning for an all-out submarine campaign as the ultimate weapon to bring down the allies, after the war on land had bogged down in trench warfare. Supremely confident of success, the naval strategists, with the support of the kaiser, held firm against any premature truce. Britain and France, for their part, had entered into secret negotiations with each other and with the other allies (Russia, Japan, and Italy) to divide up the spoils of victory. Assuming that the war would ultimately be won, they wanted postwar territorial dispositions to reflect the victory, at the expense of Germany and its overseas empire. These negotiations were kept secret from the Americans and could not, for obvious reasons, be the rationale for rejecting American mediation. Rather, officials in London and Paris encouraged House’s efforts so as to curry favor with the United States. They agreed to Wilson’s terms as the basis for negotiation and even succeeded in having the latter pledge that if Germany and its allies should not agree to attend a peace conference the United States was to call, the latter “would probably enter the war” on their side. This was an unusual commitment on Wilson’s part and may have reflected his confidence that the pledge would not have to be honored, because Germany would see the wisdom of a mediated peace.",['1916 –'],european government ready initiative sure britain france germany – country visit house 1916 – flatly turn wilson ’s offer mediation antagonize united state leader listen house express willingness explore possibility negotiate peace berlin particular seek embarrass british french agree let united state proceed peace effort underneath german navy plan submarine campaign ultimate weapon bring ally war land bogg trench warfare supremely confident success naval strategist support kaiser hold firm premature truce britain france enter secret negotiation ally russia japan italy divide spoil victory assume war ultimately win want postwar territorial disposition reflect victory expense germany overseas empire negotiation keep secret american obvious reason rationale reject mediation official london paris encourage house ’s effort curry favor united state agree wilson ’s term basis negotiation succeed have pledge germany ally agree attend peace conference united state “ probably enter war ” unusual commitment wilson ’s reflect confidence pledge honor germany wisdom mediate peace,151,[1916],1916,1,1925,1950
740,"The ultimate failure of America’s mediation efforts – a failure that became evident when Germany announced the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917 – should not detract from the historic significance of these developments. The United States had prepared itself economically and intellectually for a crucial role in the European conflict. And now, in 1917, it was about to define its role in military, strategic terms and to assume a leadership position not only in European but also in global affairs from which it would not retreat for decades to come, except for a brief interlude in the mid-1930s. In that sense, the twentieth century, as the century in which the United States emerged as the principal world power, may be said to have begun in 1917.","['January 1917 –', '1917', 'decades', 'the mid-1930s', 'the twentieth century', 'as the century', '1917']",ultimate failure america ’s mediation effort – failure evident germany announce resumption unrestricted submarine warfare january 1917 – detract historic significance development united state prepare economically intellectually crucial role european conflict 1917 define role military strategic term assume leadership position european global affair retreat decade come brief interlude mid-1930 sense twentieth century century united state emerge principal world power say begin 1917,62,"[1917, 1917, 1930, 1917]",1920,4,1925,1950
741,"First of all, the United States found itself becoming more and more deeply involved in Asian affairs because it was the only power capable of influencing the course of acrimonious, often violent relations between China and Japan. It should be noted that the coming of the European war coincided with important changes within both these countries. The Meiji emperor, under whom Japan had undertaken successful programs of military strengthening and colonial acquisitions, died in 1912, and the coming of the Taisho era triggered movements against the continuation of those programs. Some called for a cutback in military spending, and others for more democratic government. But then war came in Europe, and Japan’s expeditions to Shandong and the German islands further expanded the power of the military, which sought to take advantage of the temporary absence of European nations from China by entrenching Japanese influence there. One climax came in May 1915, when Japan presented a list of twenty-one demands to China, including the renewal of the lease of south Manchurian bases, the transfer of the German rights in Shandong to Japan, and Japanese supervision of Chinese police.","['1912', 'May 1915']",united state find deeply involved asian affair power capable influence course acrimonious violent relation china japan note come european war coincide important change country meiji emperor japan undertake successful program military strengthening colonial acquisition die 1912 coming taisho era trigger movement continuation program call cutback military spending democratic government war come europe japan ’s expedition shandong german island expand power military seek advantage temporary absence european nation china entrench japanese influence climax come 1915 japan present list demand china include renewal lease south manchurian base transfer german right shandong japan japanese supervision chinese police,94,"[1912, 1915]",1914,2,1925,1950
742,"China was vulnerable to such strong tactics on the part of Japan because it, too, was undergoing internal change. In 1911 a revolt had erupted against the reigning Qing (Ch’ing) dynasty, and in the following year the three-century-old dynasty came to an end, unable to withstand either the revolutionary movements or its own internal decay as manifested by the unwillingness of the scholar-gentry class to come to its rescue. Instead, these erstwhile elites combined with the revolutionaries to proclaim the Republic of China. Much confusion and disunity ensued, but by 1913 Yuan Shikai (Yüan Shih-k’ai), a former high Qing official, emerged as the new leader, assuming the title of provisional president. He was opposed, however, by more radical groups led by Sun Yat-sen and by other former leaders, some of whom held sway over various regions of the country. They soon developed their own military bases and became warlords, effectively dividing the young republic into so many subunits. Underneath all this turmoil, at the same time, new political and intellectual winds were blowing. Deeply influenced by what they took to be China’s embarrassing weakness in international affairs, the “young China” leaders were determined to put an end to the country’s humiliation. The emerging opinion leaders – university professors and students, merchants, journalists, and even some army officers trained abroad (including Japan) – were a force to be reckoned with. Thus, an episode like the twenty-one demands both revealed China’s weakness and produced a nationalistic reaction, making it extremely difficult for the government to accede to Japanese pressure.","['1911', 'the following year', 'three-century-old', '1913', '–']",china vulnerable strong tactic japan undergo internal change 1911 revolt erupt reign qing ch’ dynasty following year century old dynasty come end unable withstand revolutionary movement internal decay manifest unwillingness scholar gentry class come rescue instead erstwhile elite combine revolutionary proclaim republic china confusion disunity ensue 1913 yuan shikai yüan shih k’ai high qing official emerge new leader assume title provisional president oppose radical group lead sun yat sen leader hold sway region country soon develop military base warlord effectively divide young republic subunit underneath turmoil time new political intellectual wind blow deeply influence take china ’s embarrassing weakness international affair “ young china ” leader determine end country ’s humiliation emerge opinion leader – university professor student merchant journalist army officer train abroad include japan – force reckon episode like demand reveal china ’s weakness produce nationalistic reaction make extremely difficult government accede japanese pressure,146,"[1911, 1913]",1912,2,1925,1950
743,"The situation augured well for China, which many Americans now called their “sister republic.” The new Chinese leaders could surely expect to benefit from the emerging presence of the United States in the international arena as they undertook to reorganize their own national affairs. And President Wilson obliged without hesitation. Even before the republican revolt began in 1911, he had shown a strong interest in missionary activities, and as president he was eager to promote American influence – Christian and secular – in China. He appointed a scholar, Paul Reinsch of the University of Wisconsin, as minister to Peking and sent another, Frank Goodnow of Johns Hopkins, as special adviser to Yuan Shikai. Wilson also sought to interest American bankers in investing in China’s future by providing funds for the development of railways and industry. It was quite natural, then, that Yuan and his aides should have turned to the United States for help when they were confronted with wartime Japanese imperialism, in particular the twenty-one demands of 1915.","['now', '1911', '–', '1915']",situation augur china american call “ sister republic ” new chinese leader surely expect benefit emerge presence united state international arena undertake reorganize national affair president wilson oblige hesitation republican revolt begin 1911 show strong interest missionary activity president eager promote influence – christian secular – china appoint scholar paul reinsch university wisconsin minister peking send frank goodnow johns hopkins special adviser yuan shikai wilson seek interest banker invest china ’s future provide fund development railway industry natural yuan aide turn united state help confront wartime japanese imperialism particular demand 1915,91,"[1911, 1915]",1913,2,1925,1950
744,"Such a policy of support for China combined with the placating of Japan did not satisfy President Wilson, whose sympathies lay mostly with the former. In order to help China more effectively, he decided to encourage its entry into the European war. It would be primarily of symbolic significance alone, but by declaring war against Germany and Austria, China would be able to confiscate enemy property, put an end to the “unequal” treaties that had given these countries special rights and privileges, and treat Germans and Austrians as enemy aliens subject to incarceration. If nothing else, such steps would demonstrate that the Chinese were not powerless and that they could take on some of the world’s mightiest powers. The Japanese well understood such logic and symbolism and for that reason opposed China’s entering the war. By the beginning of 1917, however, they had come to reconcile themselves to the situation and even to see the wisdom of supporting China’s war against Germany. By then Yuan was dead (he had died in June 1916), and Peking was under the control of warlords, at least some of whom were considered to be pro-Japanese. So, by not standing in the way of China’s entering the war, Tokyo hoped to smooth the path for improved relations between the two countries.","['the beginning of 1917', 'June 1916']",policy support china combine placating japan satisfy president wilson sympathy lie order help china effectively decide encourage entry european war primarily symbolic significance declare war germany austria china able confiscate enemy property end “ unequal ” treaty give country special right privilege treat german austrian enemy alien subject incarceration step demonstrate chinese powerless world ’s mighty power japanese understand logic symbolism reason oppose china ’s enter war beginning 1917 come reconcile situation wisdom support china ’s war germany yuan dead die june 1916 peking control warlord consider pro japanese stand way china ’ enter war tokyo hop smooth path improved relation country,102,"[1917, 1916]",1916,2,1925,1950
745,"To be sure, each country represented its unique problems. In Mexico’s case two American interventions (in 1914 and 1916) were bound up with the country’s internal turmoil following the overthrow of the thirty-five-year dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz in 1911. Out of the chaos, one power contender, Victoriano Huerta, emerged as the strongman and proclaimed himself the new president, just before Woodrow Wilson entered the White House. Unlike China’s Yuan Shikai, however, Huerta did not impress President Wilson as worthy of America’s support. On the contrary, Wilson believed the Mexican had come to power through intimidation and even assassination of his opponents. The Mexican people, Wilson was convinced, deserved better, and until a more democratically elected leader emerged, the United States would withhold formal recognition. De facto relations continued to exist between the two countries, but even these were jeopardized when, in the spring of 1914, U.S. troops landed in and occupied Vera Cruz in retaliation against the arrest of several American sailors in Tampico, to which they had been sent from a warship to obtain gasoline. The strong action was intended to force Huerta’s resignation, something that eventually was accomplished, but not until after even his opponents denounced the U.S. intervention.","['1914', '1916', 'five-year', '1911', 'the spring of 1914']",sure country represent unique problem mexico ’s case intervention 1914 1916 bind country ’s internal turmoil follow overthrow thirty year dictatorship porfirio díaz 1911 chaos power contender victoriano huerta emerge strongman proclaim new president woodrow wilson enter white house unlike china ’s yuan shikai huerta impress president wilson worthy america ’s support contrary wilson believe mexican come power intimidation assassination opponent mexican people wilson convince deserve better democratically elect leader emerge united state withhold formal recognition de facto relation continue exist country jeopardize spring 1914 u.s troop land occupied vera cruz retaliation arrest sailor tampico send warship obtain gasoline strong action intend force huerta ’s resignation eventually accomplish opponent denounce u.s intervention,112,"[1914, 1916, 1911, 1914]",1914,4,1925,1950
746,"The affair was a good example of complications that accompanied America’s emerging global role: the conflict between the American policy of promoting reformist government in another country, on one hand, and the latter’s nationalism, which often transcended its internecine strife, on the other. A particularly unfortunate variant of the theme was the U.S.-Mexican altercation of 1916, which resulted from an American expedition into northern Mexico in pursuit of troops loyal to Francisco Villa, who, challenging the authority of the new provisional president, Venustiano Carranza, had invaded U.S. territory (New Mexico) in order to embarrass the latter. Villa almost succeeded, as Carranza protested against the expedition, which was led by General John J. Pershing. There was talk of war between the two countries, but they desisted from that step, in part because President Wilson could not justify such a development in view of the deepening U.S. involvement in the European hostilities, but also because Carranza preferred to end the crisis and win American diplomatic recognition as a reward.

747,"U.S. expeditions to Haiti (1915) and Santo Domingo (1916) were less complicated than those to Mexico, because in neither country was there a unified movement to mobilize nationalistic opinion against foreign intervention. But the situation in Hispaniola was analogous to that in China or Mexico in that in both Haiti and Santo Domingo there was apparently endless political disorder, with politicians assassinating one another and ordinary people helpless to stop corruption and turmoil. The situation persuaded President Wilson that the United States would have to step in to “teach” these people “how to elect good men.” This was the Caribbean version of what would soon emerge as the “safe for democracy” principle. American marines and naval forces were the instrument for this educational process; they supervised elections, maintained law and order, and, in the case of the Dominican Republic, even took over cabinet posts. The protectorate over these countries went beyond the scope of the Roosevelt Corollary (which had led to the establishment of customs receiverships) and included the appointment of American financial advisers, sanitation engineers, and police instructors.","['1915', '1916']",u.s expedition haiti 1915 santo domingo 1916 complicated mexico country unified movement mobilize nationalistic opinion foreign intervention situation hispaniola analogous china mexico haiti santo domingo apparently endless political disorder politician assassinate ordinary people helpless stop corruption turmoil situation persuade president wilson united state step “ teach ” people “ elect good man ” caribbean version soon emerge “ safe democracy ” principle marine naval force instrument educational process supervise election maintain law order case dominican republic take cabinet post protectorate country go scope roosevelt corollary lead establishment custom receivership include appointment financial adviser sanitation engineer police instructor,97,"[1915, 1916]",1916,2,1925,1950
748,"Even as Washington supported China’s vehement opposition to Japan’s twenty-one demands, which would have turned the former into the latter’s protectorate and which the Japanese justified as a means for putting an end to Chinese chaos, the Wilson administration was establishing military rule over two Caribbean countries. It would be continued for many years; U.S. forces would be withdrawn from Santo Domingo only in 1924, and from Haiti not until 1934. Combined with America’s military presence in Nicaragua, where Wilson maintained his predecessor’s policy of stationing U.S. marines (they would stay till 1925) and establishing a customs receivership, the United States was clearly turning itself into the overlord of the region. How different was such behavior from Japan’s in Asia? At least as far as Wilson was concerned, there was no contradiction at all between his espousal of a peaceful world order and the use of military force in the Caribbean. A future peace that he was then envisioning would be a cooperative one in which international action might sometimes have to override parochial concerns. Force would have a role to play so long as it was employed for nobler, not traditional, objectives.11 Indeed, the United States was about to become engaged in a massive war – for a noble end. In that sense, the Mexican and Caribbean expeditions may be considered a rehearsal for preparing the nation for the grand task of global reconstruction.","['many years', '1924', '1934', '1925', 'a noble end']",washington support china ’s vehement opposition japan ’s demand turn ’s protectorate japanese justify means put end chinese chaos wilson administration establish military rule caribbean country continue year u.s force withdraw santo domingo 1924 haiti 1934 combine america ’s military presence nicaragua wilson maintain predecessor ’s policy station u.s marine stay till 1925 establish custom receivership united state clearly turn overlord region different behavior japan ’s asia far wilson concern contradiction espousal peaceful world order use military force caribbean future peace envision cooperative international action override parochial concern force role play long employ noble traditional objectives.11 united state engaged massive war – noble end sense mexican caribbean expedition consider rehearsal prepare nation grand task global reconstruction,116,"[1924, 1934, 1925]",1928,3,1950,1950
749,"Few countries were as well prepared to go to war as the United States in 1917. Not that the nation had made specific preparations to enter the European conflict on the side of Britain and its allies against Germany and other “central” powers. Officials in Washington as well as the American people would have welcomed a peace if it had been arranged by the combatants without their military intervention. Yet if intervention were to come, the United States was in an excellent position to make a decisive difference. It had strengthened itself economically and militarily during the years of neutrality, the people had had ample time to educate themselves about world affairs and their country’s potential role in them, and American foreign policy had been so conducted as to ensure the nation’s leadership position once it entered the war.","['1917', 'the years']",country prepared war united state 1917 nation specific preparation enter european conflict britain ally germany “ central ” power official washington people welcome peace arrange combatant military intervention intervention come united state excellent position decisive difference strengthen economically militarily year neutrality people ample time educate world affair country ’s potential role foreign policy conduct ensure nation ’s leadership position enter war,61,[1917],1917,1,1925,1950
750,"In the military sphere, President Woodrow Wilson had, in 1916, begun calling for preparedness – at first in order to keep the nation so prepared militarily that no power would dare challenge its security and interests. After 1917, of course, the purpose changed to creating a strong armed force to fight a war. The Selective Service Act of May 1917 established a system for registering Americans for military service, and within a year the army was able to send over two million “doughboys” to Europe. The navy would in the meantime be augmented, and the naval building program of 1918 envisaged making the U.S. navy the most powerful in the world. The armed forces would be equipped with arms and munitions all produced domestically, and a governmental bureaucracy was created to establish priorities in allocating resources. There was a significant degree of nationalization of railways and other infrastructure. All this might have cost other countries much time, not to mention money, and strained the social order, but in the United States the transition from peace to war was relatively smooth and painless. The nation could “afford” the war economically and politically. The government had sufficient revenue, there was no diminution of consumer goods even while factories produced military hardware, and the Progressive ideology of state-society cooperation (that the government and the people should cooperate closely to effect necessary reforms) could be applied to war as well as to peace.","['1916', '1917', 'May 1917', 'a year', '1918']",military sphere president woodrow wilson 1916 begin call preparedness – order nation prepare militarily power dare challenge security interest 1917 course purpose change create strong armed force fight war selective service act 1917 establish system register american military service year army able send million “ doughboy ” europe navy meantime augment naval building program 1918 envisage make u.s navy powerful world armed force equip arm munition produce domestically governmental bureaucracy create establish priority allocate resource significant degree nationalization railway infrastructure cost country time mention money strain social order united state transition peace war relatively smooth painless nation “ afford ” war economically politically government sufficient revenue diminution consumer good factory produce military hardware progressive ideology state society cooperation government people cooperate closely effect necessary reform apply war peace,128,"[1916, 1917, 1917, 1918]",1917,4,1925,1950
751,"Even so, America’s entry into the European war, making the conflict a “world” war, was not something the nation chose deliberately. Had there been an easing of U.S.-German tensions following Berlin’s announcement of an unrestricted U-boat campaign in January 1917, Washington might have decided to go back to its mediatory endeavor. During the next three months, however, developments in Europe and elsewhere conspired to lead to the American decision for war. First, despite Wilson’s denunciation of the renewed U-boat campaign, the German navy went ahead with the deployment of submarines, which promptly sank American mercantile vessels in addition to British warships. The hostile behavior of the German Admiralty, and the Berlin government’s apparent capitulation to it, persuaded Wilson that Germany was not interested in a negotiated end to the war and that German militarism was the main obstacle to peace. This, of course, had been the British position all along, so the United States was belatedly embracing it. All the acrimonious disputes with London regarding neutral rights seemed to pale in significance in comparison with this fundamental issue of the war.","['January 1917', 'the next three months']",america ’s entry european war make conflict “ world ” war nation choose deliberately easing u.s .- german tension follow berlin ’s announcement unrestricted u boat campaign january 1917 washington decide mediatory endeavor month development europe conspire lead decision war despite wilson ’s denunciation renew u boat campaign german navy go ahead deployment submarine promptly sink mercantile vessel addition british warship hostile behavior german admiralty berlin government ’s apparent capitulation persuade wilson germany interested negotiate end war german militarism main obstacle peace course british position united state belatedly embrace acrimonious dispute london neutral right pale significance comparison fundamental issue war,100,[1917],1917,1,1925,1950
752,"Relations between the United States and Germany deteriorated further in late February, when the United States intercepted a message from Alfred Zimmermann, the German foreign secretary, to the Mexican government offering an alliance between the two countries (with the possible addition of Japan) against the United States. Zimmermann even hinted that Germany might help Mexico recover the lands it had lost to its northern neighbor in 1848. American officials had already been alarmed over the growth of German influence in Mexico, and the Zimmermann telegram, which was widely published in the United States, inflamed public opinion.1 Then in March Russian revolutionaries rose against the tsarist regime and established a reformist government, which, on its surface, appeared more democratic and attuned to the wishes of the people. The event had immediate implications for American policy as President Wilson interpreted it as evidence of the rising democratic tide throughout the world. That was a most heartening development and needed strong support by the United States lest it be crushed by autocratic forces – and Germany now exemplified the latter. The time had come for the United States to enter the fray.","['late February', '1848', 'March Russian', '–']",relation united state germany deteriorate late february united state intercept message alfred zimmermann german foreign secretary mexican government offer alliance country possible addition japan united state zimmermann hint germany help mexico recover land lose northern neighbor 1848 official alarm growth german influence mexico zimmermann telegram widely publish united state inflame public opinion.1 march russian revolutionary rise tsarist regime establish reformist government surface appear democratic attuned wish people event immediate implication policy president wilson interpret evidence rise democratic tide world heartening development need strong support united state lest crush autocratic force – germany exemplify time come united state enter fray,99,[1848],1848,1,1850,1850
753,"American entry into the war became official on April 2, 1917, when President Wilson presented his war message to Congress. The message was a clear statement of American grievances against Germany, in particular the latter’s unrestricted U-boat campaign. But Wilson went much beyond listing specific grievances and couched the war decision in broader, ideological terms. The United States was going to fight Germany, he said, because the latter had proved to be a menace to world peace and civilization. So long as German militarism remained, there could be no secure peace. This much was a reiteration of Wilson’s as well as Foreign Secretary Edward Grey’s ideas, which they had already expressed on a number of occasions. The president now put the struggle against German militarism in a universalistic, historical framework by asserting that the militarism itself was a product of an autocracy that had long suppressed democratic aspirations of the people. Echoing Immanuel Kant more than a century earlier, Wilson argued that only a democratic government could be counted upon to pursue a peaceful foreign policy. The growing sentiment for democracy and peace was a historical inevitability, and the United States was being called upon to ensure this historic progression. Because the European democracies such as Britain, France, and Russia (under its newly democratic regime) were unable by themselves to combat German military power, the United States had to step in. It would have to wage a war against a mighty European power, something it had not done for over one hundred years. The United States would now make its military power available to help determine the outcome of the European conflict and, most important, to ensure that the world would be “made safe for democracy.” Four days later (April 6), Congress declared war against Germany.","['April 2, 1917', 'more than a century earlier', 'over one hundred years', 'Four days later', 'April 6']",entry war official april 2 1917 president wilson present war message congress message clear statement grievance germany particular ’s unrestricted u boat campaign wilson go list specific grievance couch war decision broad ideological term united state go fight germany say prove menace world peace civilization long german militarism remain secure peace reiteration wilson ’ foreign secretary edward grey ’s idea express number occasion president struggle german militarism universalistic historical framework assert militarism product autocracy long suppress democratic aspiration people echo immanuel kant century earlier wilson argue democratic government count pursue peaceful foreign policy grow sentiment democracy peace historical inevitability united state call ensure historic progression european democracy britain france russia newly democratic regime unable combat german military power united state step wage war mighty european power year united state military power available help determine outcome european conflict important ensure world “ safe democracy ” day later april 6 congress declare war germany,152,[1917],1917,1,1925,1950
754,"For instance, Germany would try desperately to bring the enemy to its knees before American reinforcements arrived. To do so, it would be imperative to make maximum use of U-boats to destroy as much British naval power as possible, in the meantime using the ground troops for two principal objectives: to push Russian forces back as far east as possible and to occupy Paris and its environs. Germany was quite successful in the first objective, not least because Russian troops had become demoralized after months of fighting. The March revolution had toppled the unpopular tsarist regime, but the new leaders had trouble appealing to the masses to continue the war effort. Desertions from the armed forces continued, and in the meantime the radical Bolsheviks, who had never accepted the new leadership, actively campaigned among the rank and file to turn them against the war. They denounced the war as an imperialistic exploitation of oppressed peoples. The German high command, eager to exploit the situation, sought to drive Russia out of the war by encouraging such dissent and political instability. In a famous move, they put V. I. Lenin, the leader of the Bolsheviks living in Switzerland, on a train and sent him to Petrograd, with the obvious intention of turning him loose to create further confusion. The strategy worked, and soon the Bolsheviks succeeded in seizing power in Petrograd and a few other cities in November 1917. The Bolshevik success meant the defection of Russia from the anti-German coalition, precisely what Germany was counting on.","['months', 'November 1917']",instance germany try desperately bring enemy knee reinforcement arrive imperative maximum use u boat destroy british naval power possible meantime ground troop principal objective push russian force far east possible occupy paris environs germany successful objective russian troop demoralized month fighting march revolution topple unpopular tsarist regime new leader trouble appeal mass continue war effort desertion armed force continue meantime radical bolshevik accept new leadership actively campaign rank file turn war denounce war imperialistic exploitation oppressed people german high command eager exploit situation seek drive russia war encourage dissent political instability famous v. i. lenin leader bolshevik live switzerland train send petrograd obvious intention turn loose create confusion strategy work soon bolshevik succeed seize power petrograd city november 1917 bolshevik success mean defection russia anti german coalition precisely germany count,130,[1917],1917,1,1925,1950
755,"In France, too, Germans were quite successful. They were determined to push on toward Paris before the Americans had a chance to come to the latter’s rescue. And in the spring of 1918 German forces advanced to within a few miles of the city. In France as well as in England, Germany also sought to exploit the growing war weariness. The weariness might dissipate once American reinforcements appeared on the scene, and so it was all the more imperative to achieve quick successes in battle. In the meantime, German forces routed Italians in a major battle in October so that, at the end of 1917, it seemed as if German victory were within reach – unless Americans arrived to prevent it.","['the spring', '1918', 'October', 'the end of 1917', 'reach –']",france germans successful determine push paris american chance come ’s rescue spring 1918 german force advance mile city france england germany seek exploit grow war weariness weariness dissipate reinforcement appear scene imperative achieve quick success battle meantime german force rout italian major battle october end 1917 german victory reach – american arrive prevent,53,"[1918, 1917]",1918,2,1925,1950

It would be difficult to say that the Americans were clearly the principal winners in the war, and more correct to note that their role was primarily to stop further German advances. But that was considered sufficient, for in the absence of a clear-cut victory, the German high command realized that time was on the side of the United States. Not only on land but at sea – where America’s participation in laying mines and blockading the German coast effectively countered Germany’s U-boat campaign – American entry into the conflict demonstrated that the most the Germans would be able to get out of the war would be a draw. In other words, American participation spelled the defeat of German ambitions.",['June 1918'],arrive impressive way start june 1918 altogether million troop land french shore ready combat german difficult american clearly principal winner war correct note role primarily stop german advance consider sufficient absence clear cut victory german high command realize time united state land sea – america ’s participation lay mine blockade german coast effectively counter germany ’s u boat campaign – entry conflict demonstrate german able war draw word participation spell defeat german ambition,73,[1918],1918,1,1925,1950
757,"Why were the American forces so successful in fighting against a well-trained, seasoned German military power? A number of factors may be mentioned. American soldiers and sailors were fresh to the war, still in the initial phase of enthusiasm, whereas the Germans had already experienced more than two years of trench warfare. More important, there was an apparently endless supply of American troops, whereas German resources had been stretched to the limit. Nor should one forget that Germany’s close ally, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was disintegrating, making it easier for the United States and its “associates” to threaten Germany in the rear by encouraging separatist movements within the Habsburg Empire. For instance, when some Czech leaders established an interim government in Paris, the United States was quick to recognize it. President Wilson even sent a small-scale expedition to Siberia in order to rescue several thousand Czech troops who had apparently been trapped there and were eager to go back to Europe to fight. Washington likewise encouraged the anti-Habsburg sentiments of such other ethnic groups as Serbs and Croatians, as well as sympathizing with Armenians, Kurds, and others living under Ottoman rule who sought to take advantage of the war to seek their autonomy. (The “Armenian massacre” of 1915, involving the expulsion and killing of hundreds of thousands of Armenians on the grounds that they were cooperating with the Russian enemy, was condemned by the allies as well as Americans and is often cited as the first “crime against humanity” that was internationally recognized as such.) All these developments weakened Germany’s ability to create an effective fighting force to meet the American challenge.","['more than two years', '1915']",force successful fight train seasoned german military power number factor mention soldier sailor fresh war initial phase enthusiasm germans experience year trench warfare important apparently endless supply troop german resource stretch limit forget germany ’s close ally austro hungarian empire disintegrate make easy united state “ associate ” threaten germany rear encourage separatist movement habsburg empire instance czech leader establish interim government paris united state quick recognize president wilson send small scale expedition siberia order rescue thousand czech troop apparently trap eager europe fight washington likewise encourage anti habsburg sentiment ethnic group serb croatian sympathize armenian kurd live ottoman rule seek advantage war seek autonomy “ armenian massacre ” 1915 involve expulsion killing hundred thousand armenian ground cooperate russian enemy condemn ally american cite “ crime humanity ” internationally recognize development weaken germany ’s ability create effective fighting force meet challenge,141,[1915],1915,1,1925,1950
758,"By far the greatest reason for the ultimate success of the American war effort, however, was the nation’s economic resources, which it shared generously with its allies. As noted in the preceding chapter, three years’ neutrality had brought enormous riches to the United States as it expanded export trade to the belligerents and lent money to them. Now, the accumulated wealth would be put to use in the form of arms and soldiers. Between April 1917 and the armistice in November 1918, the nation raised (and paid for) an army of four million, a navy of sixteen new warships plus numerous submarines, and an arsenal of formidable arrays of modern weapons. The income tax, which had been enacted just prior to the war, proved to be the most effective way of financing such a military machine, although the government also obtained funds by selling bonds. Altogether the United States lent more than $7.7 billion to the allies during the war. Compare this with America’s national income of roughly $40 billion in 1917, and it is easy to understand why it must not have been excessively painful for the American people to finance the war.","['Between April 1917', 'November 1918', '1917']",far great reason ultimate success war effort nation ’s economic resource share generously ally note precede chapter years’ neutrality bring enormous rich united state expand export trade belligerent lend money accumulate wealth use form arm soldier april 1917 armistice november 1918 nation raise pay army million navy sixteen new warship plus numerous submarine arsenal formidable array modern weapon income tax enact prior war prove effective way financing military machine government obtain fund sell bond altogether united state lend 7.7 billion ally war compare america ’s national income roughly 40 billion 1917 easy understand excessively painful people finance war,98,"[1917, 1918, 1917]",1917,3,1925,1950

This was not surprising in view of his keen interest, prior to 1917, in shaping the world to come after the war.

760,"Between April 1917 and the armistice of November 1918, Wilson made numerous statements to spell out his visions, but none was as famous as the “Fourteen Points” speech of January 1918. In it, he enumerated conditions that would serve as the basis for bringing an end to the fighting. Reflecting his crusading spirit, the Fourteen Points included references to open diplomacy (against secret treaties and alliances), the Open Door, arms control, and a new organization of nations to ensure the peace in the future. All these ideas had been around for some time, but Wilson’s contribution lay in putting them together in a comprehensive agenda for peace.","['Between April 1917', 'November 1918', 'January 1918']",april 1917 armistice november 1918 wilson numerous statement spell vision famous “ fourteen point ” speech january 1918 enumerate condition serve basis bring end fighting reflect crusading spirit fourteen point include reference open diplomacy secret treaty alliance open door arm control new organization nation ensure peace future idea time wilson ’s contribution lay put comprehensive agenda peace,57,"[1917, 1918, 1918]",1918,3,1925,1950
761,"Wilson presented the proposal in universalistic terms because he believed it was the best way to appeal to the belligerents, especially to the ordinary people in Germany, France, Britain, and elsewhere so that they would decide to put down their arms on honorable terms. Whether the president also had in mind the Chinese, Japanese, and other non-Europeans in the war is not clear, but these latter would soon come to recognize the profound implications of Wilsonianism. (In October 1917, the United States and Japan signed an agreement, the so-called Lansing-Ishii Agreement, to the effect that the former recognized the latter’s “special interests in China.” This sounded very much like the old diplomacy against which Wilson had crusaded. But the agreement contained a secret protocol declaring that the two nations would “not take advantage of the present conditions to seek special rights or privileges in China which would abridge the rights of the subjects or citizens of other friendly states.” Obviously, this latter was more in accordance with Wilsonian principles. To have had to keep it a secret was ironical and unfortunate, for not being aware of its existence, the Chinese would protest vehemently against the Lansing-Ishii Agreement.)3",['October 1917'],wilson present proposal universalistic term believe good way appeal belligerent especially ordinary people germany france britain decide arm honorable term president mind chinese japanese non europeans war clear soon come recognize profound implication wilsonianism october 1917 united state japan sign agreement call lansing ishii agreement effect recognize ’s “ special interest china ” sound like old diplomacy wilson crusade agreement contain secret protocol declare nation “ advantage present condition seek special right privilege china abridge right subject citizen friendly state ” obviously accordance wilsonian principle secret ironical unfortunate aware existence chinese protest vehemently lansing ishii agreement.)3,96,[1917],1917,1,1925,1950
762,"When the Fourteen Points were announced, most American troops had not yet arrived in Europe, and chances for a speedy peace appeared remote. In fact, in March 1918 Germany succeeded in detaching Russia from the war; as will be seen, the Bolshevik leaders had decided that their priority was to get out of the war, and they were willing to accept even humiliating terms (such as the loss of Poland, Finland, the Baltic states, and the Ukraine) in order to obtain the peace. The treaty of Brest-Litovsk enabled the Germans to concentrate on the western front.

763,"In the meantime, the Bolsheviks launched an ideological offensive to challenge not only traditional European diplomacy but also Wilsonian internationalism. They were ideological heirs to the antiimperialists at the turn of the century – such as John A. Hobson and Rudolf Hilferding – who had assaulted the imperialistic activities of the powers as detrimental to the true interests of the citizens of those powers, especially the working class. It was natural that Lenin, the leading ideologue of the Bolsheviks, should make antiimperialism a central part of his revolutionary doctrine. In 1916 he had argued, in Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, that capitalist nations were destined to become imperialistic, to seek an outlet for their surplus capital, and that the European war was nothing but an imperialistic war as a result of such a development. It followed that the only way to put an end to war, and also to bring about an end to capitalistic exploitation, was to eradicate imperialism. This could be done, Lenin asserted after the 1917 seizure of power, by espousing the cause of the oppressed peoples in the colonial areas. He, Trotsky, and Leo Karakhan, people’s commissar for foreign affairs under the Bolsheviks, repeatedly enunciated the doctrine of antiimperialism. Specifically, they would repudiate all tsarist acts in the colonial areas, denounce colonial agreements with other imperialist powers, and call upon the colonial populations to rise up against their Western masters.7","['the turn of the century –', '1916', '1917']",meantime bolshevik launch ideological offensive challenge traditional european diplomacy wilsonian internationalism ideological heir antiimperialist turn century – john a. hobson rudolf hilferd – assault imperialistic activity power detrimental true interest citizen power especially working class natural lenin lead ideologue bolshevik antiimperialism central revolutionary doctrine 1916 argue imperialism high stage capitalism capitalist nation destine imperialistic seek outlet surplus capital european war imperialistic war result development follow way end war bring end capitalistic exploitation eradicate imperialism lenin assert 1917 seizure power espouse because oppress people colonial area trotsky leo karakhan people ’s commissar foreign affair bolshevik repeatedly enunciate doctrine antiimperialism specifically repudiate tsarist act colonial area denounce colonial agreement imperialist power colonial population rise western masters.7,114,"[1916, 1917]",1916,2,1925,1950
764,"There were thus germs of what would soon develop into a gigantic duel between Wilsonianism and Leninism, between American vision and Russian revolution. In 1917–18, however, it would be wrong to suggest that the line was already sharply drawn, for Wilson was trying to distance himself from the European powers even as he joined them in the war effort. He believed the United States had a distinctive role to play during the war and in the postwar world, and to preserve freedom of action it was imperative to keep a distance from the British, French, and other allies. He was hopeful of arousing the masses of Europe to repudiate the Old Diplomacy, and in this regard he was little different from Lenin. Both stood for a new international order. Both saw a clear connection between international order and domestic order. At least as far as Europe was concerned, both Wilson and Lenin supported the breakup of the Habsburg and Ottoman empires.

766,"It was not until the spring of 1918, when Wilson learned about the presence and apparent plight of the Czech legion in Siberia, that he persuaded himself of the urgency of an allied expedition to the area. By then it was becoming evident that the Japanese would send their troops to eastern Siberia no matter what the other powers did. They were intent upon strengthening their position in the region, adjacent to Manchuria, where they had consolidated their power by imposing the twenty-one demands on China. Wilson was determined to prevent unilateral action by Japan; the international coalition must be preserved at all cost. Under the circumstances, the best strategy appeared to be to join Japan in an expedition to Siberia. Weeks of frantic negotiations between Tokyo and Washington in the early summer resulted in an agreement that each would send up to eight thousand troops to Vladivostok, to help maintain order in that port city and along the Siberian railway, which had its terminus there, so as to enable the Czech forces to exit Russia safely.8","['the spring of 1918', 'Weeks', 'the early summer']",spring 1918 wilson learn presence apparent plight czech legion siberia persuade urgency ally expedition area evident japanese send troop eastern siberia matter power intent strengthen position region adjacent manchuria consolidate power impose demand china wilson determine prevent unilateral action japan international coalition preserve cost circumstance good strategy appear join japan expedition siberia week frantic negotiation tokyo washington early summer result agreement send thousand troop vladivostok help maintain order port city siberian railway terminus enable czech force exit russia safely.8,79,[1918],1918,1,1925,1950
767,"The expedition left a bitter legacy not just in U.S.-Japanese but also in U.S.-Russian relations. The Bolsheviks would long remember the intervention and look upon it as an example of imperialistic meddling with revolutions. It is important to keep in mind that when the belligerents met in Paris at the beginning of 1919 to consider peace terms, American and Japanese forces were still in Siberia. As far as Russia was concerned, the German war had long been over (since the Brest-Litovsk peace of March 1918), and it was humiliating to have these foreign troops on Russian soil. The Bolsheviks had not been invited to the peace conference, and they had no intention of joining other countries under the circumstances. Still, there were some attempts on both sides to prevent the situation from getting out of hand. Wilson continued to believe that despite the Siberian expedition, the powers should honor the principle of self-determination of the Russians. He might even intercede on their behalf to see if a representative government might not be established at Petrograd. Lenin, for his part, considered it prudent to retain some connection with the Western nations, in particular the United States, the country that would have the most to offer economically. There thus might have taken place a meeting of Wilson and Lenin. An invitation was in fact sent from Paris to Lenin, suggesting a meeting at Prinkipo Island, where they might discuss the establishment of a representative Russian government.9 It did not materialize, however, as Lenin insisted that only Bolsheviks be invited, whereas Wilson wanted other factions represented as well. So it would be another twenty-four years before the heads of government of the United States and Bolshevik Russia would confer face-to-face.","['the beginning of 1919', 'March 1918', 'another twenty-four years']",expedition leave bitter legacy u.s .- japanese u.s .- russian relation bolshevik long remember intervention look example imperialistic meddling revolution important mind belligerent meet paris beginning 1919 consider peace term japanese force siberia far russia concern german war long brest litovsk peace march 1918 humiliating foreign troop russian soil bolshevik invite peace conference intention join country circumstance attempt side prevent situation get hand wilson continue believe despite siberian expedition power honor principle self determination russian intercede behalf representative government establish petrograd lenin consider prudent retain connection western nation particular united state country offer economically take place meeting wilson lenin invitation fact send paris lenin suggest meeting prinkipo island discuss establishment representative russian government.9 materialize lenin insist bolshevik invite wilson want faction represent year head government united state bolshevik russia confer face face,132,"[1919, 1918]",1918,2,1925,1950
768,"The Paris peace conference was convened on January 18, 1919, and lasted until June 28, when a peace treaty with Germany was signed at the Versailles palace. During these five months, the leaders of the victorious nations sat together and discussed not only the peace terms to be imposed upon the former enemy but also the shape of the postwar world. President Woodrow Wilson personally participated, as did the leaders of the European cobelligerents: David Lloyd George (Britain), Georges Clemenceau (France), and Vittorio Orlando (Italy). Two Asian countries that had been involved in the war – China and Japan – were also represented at the Paris conference, although they did not send their respective heads of government. The participation of these countries as well as the United States in a conference to settle a war that had originated in Europe was a clear indication of the waning of the European-dominated world order.1","['January 18, 1919', 'June 28', 'these five months']",paris peace conference convene january 18 1919 last june 28 peace treaty germany sign versaille palace month leader victorious nation sit discuss peace term impose enemy shape postwar world president woodrow wilson personally participate leader european cobelligerent david lloyd george britain george clemenceau france vittorio orlando italy asian country involve war – china japan – represent paris conference send respective head government participation country united state conference settle war originate europe clear indication waning european dominate world order.1,78,[1919],1919,1,1925,1950
769,"One could go a step further and note that besides sovereign states, representatives of various “nonstate actors” (or nongovernmental organizations) also came to Paris, as if to signal that they, too, comprised the world and should be taken seriously as part of the yet-to-be-defined new world order. For instance, from various colonies spokesmen for their freedom, such as Ho Chi Minh (Indochina) and Gandhi (India), sought to take advantage of the peace conference to plead their case. From Africa and elsewhere black leaders assembled to press for “a final crusade for humanity,” in the words of the African American activist W. E. B. Du Bois, who organized the gathering.2 Some Chinese workers and intellectuals who had been in Europe during the war remained in France and agitated for national rights. (On May 4, 1919, massive demonstrations took place in China, led by students and professionals, to protest against continued foreign presence on Chinese soil.) All such gatherings and movements indicated that there was a transnational call for a new world, one that would not reflect simply the interests of the former belligerents but also the voices of subjected people everywhere. Unfortunately, these voices were not heard, not even noticed by the representatives of the nations that conferred on a peace settlement, but in retrospect it is clear that these conferees were laying the ground for what would emerge as a pillar of the global order that defined the later decades of the twentieth century.","['May 4, 1919', 'the later decades of the twentieth century']",step note sovereign state representative “ nonstate actor nongovernmental organization come paris signal comprise world take seriously define new world order instance colony spokesman freedom ho chi minh indochina gandhi india seek advantage peace conference plead case africa black leader assemble press “ final crusade humanity ” word african activist w. e. b. du bois organize gathering.2 chinese worker intellectual europe war remain france agitated national right 4 1919 massive demonstration take place china lead student professional protest continue foreign presence chinese soil gathering movement indicate transnational new world reflect simply interest belligerent voice subject people unfortunately voice hear notice representative nation confer peace settlement retrospect clear conferee lay ground emerge pillar global order define later decade twentieth century,119,[1919],1919,1,1925,1950

Wilson himself, in the Fourteen Points, had insisted on the freedom of the seas and equal access to world markets as prerequisites for a peaceful, reintegrated international economic order. He was intent on reintegrating Germany and its former allies into the postwar global economy as expeditiously as possible, firmly believing that German economic recovery was particularly crucial for the well-being of Central Europe and therefore for European stability after the war.

774,"This system was as much an economic proposition as a political measure, for some of the mandate territories (particularly in the Middle East) were rich in petroleum resources, whose future strategic importance was well recognized. Already in 1915, Britain, France, and Russia had begun discussing how to dispose of the Ottoman Empire’s vast territory, agreeing among themselves, for instance, that Constantinople and the Straits would be assigned to Russia after the war and that an international administration would be established over Palestine. These and other arrangements were formalized in the Sykes-Picot agreement of 1917 in which Britain and France virtually divided up the Middle East into their respective spheres of influence.7 After the Versailles treaty was signed, however, these regions were turned into League mandates, some to be administered by Britain and others by France on behalf of the international organization until such time as they would be ready for independence. In the meantime, in the Pacific, where the islands belonging to imperial Germany had been largely underdeveloped, those lying north of the equator were assigned to Japan as its mandates, and Tokyo viewed them primarily as assets in its search for natural resources. But the United States objected to Japan’s receiving the island of Yap as a mandate, because this tiny island was situated between Hawaii and the Philippines and could be a useful cable base.

This reflected the serious division of views among the senators as well as Wilson’s determination to persevere to the bitter end to obtain their endorsement of the new peace. The 1918 elections had resulted in a Republican majority in the Senate (forty-nine Republicans against forty-seven Democrats), and Henry Cabot Lodge (R.-Mass.), a bitter political foe of Wilson’s, now chaired the critical Foreign Relations Committee, which included six “irreconcilables,” Republicans who would not accept the Versailles treaty and the League of Nations in any form.

In the colonial areas there grew strong, often radical, antiimperialistic movements inspired by both Woodrow Wilson and V. I. Lenin.

In reality, however, the powers, including the United States, kept expanding their navies even after the war. In 1919 Wilson himself endorsed a new naval construction bill calling for the addition of sixteen battleships; if completed, they would make the U.S. navy the most powerful in the world. For Wilson to support such a plan was patently against his declared principle of disarmament, but he shared the widespread suspicion of Japan as well as of Britain, with which Japan remained an ally even after the war – both of which likewise continued to build warships. The president may have reasoned that only by matching, even surpassing, these countries’ naval construction programs would the United States finally be able to induce them to agree to a disarmament proposal. Still, such an arms race was quite destabilizing, coming as it did in the wake of the catastrophic war.

781,"The impetus for a world disarmament conference came from the U.S. Congress, where Senator William E. Borah (R.-Idaho) spearheaded the movement for naval disarmament. Borah had been one of the “irreconcilables” in the peace treaty debate, and his call for global disarmament, a Wilsonian ideal, indicates that while rejecting part of Wilsonianism, he and many others like him had not repudiated it altogether. Many of them came to be known as “peace progressives,” those who were opposed to the Versailles peace but who advocated their own schemes for what they ardently believed to be a stabler, more just world order. And one of their major goals at this time was disarmament. They argued that the world would never be spared another conflagration until the major military powers, including the United States, undertook arms reductions. Many of these senators also believed that the nation should end the occupation of foreign countries, recognize the Soviet Union, and support movements for colonial self-determination. These views were not isolationist; on the contrary, they anticipated what the nation would espouse in the decades to come. Others were less willing to go that far, but at least on the disarmament question there was developing a strong consensus in and out of Congress.

The alliance, first signed in 1902 and extended in 1911 for ten years, was up for another renewal in 1921, but the United States was vehemently opposed to it. Washington was adamant that the alliance be abrogated, not only as contradictory to the principle of open diplomacy (i.e., the rejection of particularistic and often secret arrangements such as military alliances) that sustained the new peace – another indication that the Americans continued to adhere to the spirit of Wilsonianism – but also because the alliance, if renewed, would have strategic implications for the United States, which would be forced to augment its own fleet to match the combined force of the British and Japanese navies. The latter two, for their part, would try to keep up with such increases, thus inviting a naval race among the three that would be as dangerous to world peace as the British-German naval rivalry had been prior to 1914. British and Japanese officials understood this, and although many of them were loath to give up an alliance that seemed to have served the two countries’ respective interests well, they were in no position to recommend challenging the United States.","['1902', '1911', 'ten years', '1921', '1914']",disarmament separate question asian pacific security particular future anglo japanese alliance fortification powers’ base pacific ocean alliance sign 1902 extend 1911 year renewal 1921 united state vehemently oppose washington adamant alliance abrogate contradictory principle open diplomacy i.e. rejection particularistic secret arrangement military alliance sustain new peace – indication american continue adhere spirit wilsonianism – alliance renew strategic implication united state force augment fleet match combined force british japanese navy try increase invite naval race dangerous world peace british german naval rivalry prior 1914 british japanese official understand loath alliance serve countries’ respective interest position recommend challenge united state,98,"[1902, 1911, 1921, 1914]",1912,4,1925,1950

Moreover, they, not least the United States, were quite interested in the concept of airpower. Airplanes were in their infancy, but they appeared much less expensive than warships, and air war more “humane” than land war in which soldiers confronted one another to kill or be killed.4 Even some of the staunchest advocates of disarmament supported the development of airpower, and there was to be no international agreement on this newest type of military force. In 1927, however, the United States took another initiative for naval arms limitation, this time focusing on the auxiliary craft. The United States, Britain, and Japan sent delegates to a meeting in Geneva, but France and Italy refused to participate. Moreover, the United States and Britain had divergent views on the cruiser question; the latter needed a larger number of light cruisers to defend its far-flung empire than the former was willing to concede.

If nothing else, they are a monument to the Wilsonian formulation, a fundamental faith in global interdependence overcoming parochial rivalries. The very fact that the United States took the lead is important. The Republican administrations that followed Wilson’s presidency were just as committed to Wilsonian internationalism as he himself, at least insofar as disarmament was concerned. To reduce arms, thereby removing restrictions on peacetime economic development, and to do so through international cooperation, were significant achievements, indicating a widespread determination not to repeat the mistakes of pre-1914 Europe.

Still, Britain, France, Japan, and Italy – the four permanent members of the council – along with other countries were determined to make use of the new institution for stabilizing international affairs. The council consisted of representatives from seven nations – the four permanent and three other members – and its endorsement was required for all decisions taken by the General Assembly. This was the largest organization of its kind in history – initially consisting of forty-one member states – and embodied the idea that henceforth interstate disputes should be brought before the organization rather than be settled locally through recourse to force. In reality, very few disputes were brought to the League’s attention, the 1925 territorial quarrel between Greece and Bulgaria being one such case. Still, the League’s very existence stood as a symbol of the new age.","['–', '1925']",league nation true participation united state country willingness support peace depend britain france japan italy – permanent member council – country determine use new institution stabilize international affair council consist representative seven nation – permanent member – endorsement require decision take general assembly large organization kind history – initially consist member state – embody idea henceforth interstate dispute bring organization settle locally recourse force reality dispute bring league ’s attention 1925 territorial quarrel greece bulgaria case league ’s existence stand symbol new age,83,[1925],1925,1,1950,1950
789,"Even more important, there were established several international organizations as part of the League’s activities – for instance, the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the League of Nations Health Organization. The titles of these organizations revealed that the League was to be concerned with much more than territorial or political questions; it would also deal with economic, social, and health issues in the postwar world. The ILO brought together labor leaders from various countries to exchange information and to seek to establish international guidelines for the protection of workers’ rights, and the Health Organization undertook to combat diseases across the globe. In the immediate aftermath of the war, a devastating sickness known as “Spanish flu” caused death to millions all over the world, as the germs were transmitted by returning soldiers. But there were other, equally serious contagious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and smallpox, and the Health Organization became actively involved in worldwide efforts to combat them, as it did in battling opium smoking habits in China and other parts of Asia. The League was also active on behalf of refugees, those who were driven out of their homes in the postwar redrawing of maps or caught in civil wars that erupted in many parts of the world. There was widespread recognition that all these problems were of global importance and that only an international effort would suffice to deal with them. In addition, the League established a committee on intellectual cooperation, designed to promote scholarly and artistic interchanges among individuals of various countries. Together with the Permanent Court of International Justice, or the so-called World Court, which was established at The Hague (but not the same institution as The Hague Permanent Court of Arbitration, founded in 1901), these international bodies, even more than the League itself, promoted the idea of cooperation across national boundaries. The assumption, of course, was that through such cooperation the nations of the world would learn to live in peace and harmony with one another. Internationalism thus implemented would be the backbone of the postwar peace.",['1901'],important establish international organization league ’s activity – instance international labor organization ilo league nation health organization title organization reveal league concern territorial political question deal economic social health issue postwar world ilo bring labor leader country exchange information seek establish international guideline protection workers’ right health organization undertake combat disease globe immediate aftermath war devastating sickness know “ spanish flu ” cause death million world germ transmit return soldier equally contagious disease malaria tuberculosis smallpox health organization actively involve worldwide effort combat battle opium smoking habit china part asia league active behalf refugee drive home postwar redrawing map catch civil war erupt part world widespread recognition problem global importance international effort suffice deal addition league establish committee intellectual cooperation design promote scholarly artistic interchange individual country permanent court international justice call world court establish hague institution hague permanent court arbitration found 1901 international body league promote idea cooperation national boundary assumption course cooperation nation world learn live peace harmony internationalism implement backbone postwar peace,165,[1901],1901,1,1925,1950
790,"Although the United States was not a member of the League of Nations, it was represented in the ILO, the Health Organization, and the committee on intellectual cooperation. Individual Americans enthusiastically participated in the activities of these organizations. Unfortunately, the United States chose not to adhere to the World Court’s protocol, which would have meant that the nation might seek the court’s opinion concerning some cases or that an American judge might be called upon to pass on some disputes. The Republican administrations throughout the 1920s were supportive of the idea, but the Senate was opposed, fearing that the court might provide a back door through which the nation might find itself a member of the League. In retrospect, however, it would seem that the role of the court in promoting internationalism was much less than that of the ILO and other bodies, so that the United States – or at least individual Americans – had an ample opportunity to serve the cause of international cooperation and peace.","['the 1920s', '–']",united state member league nation represent ilo health organization committee intellectual cooperation individual american enthusiastically participate activity organization unfortunately united state choose adhere world court ’s protocol mean nation seek court ’s opinion concern case judge call pass dispute republican administration 1920s supportive idea senate oppose fear court provide door nation find member league retrospect role court promote internationalism ilo body united state – individual american – ample opportunity serve because international cooperation peace,74,[1920],1920,1,1925,1950
791,"In the meantime, in Europe the postwar peace remained fragile in the immediate aftermath of the Versailles conference. In 1920 the League’s reparations commission set the figure of $33 billion as the sum Germany was to pay its former enemies as reparations. But the Germans refused, considering the figure exorbitant and resorting to printing money to sabotage reparations payments. In anger, in 1923 French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr valley, an industrial center, and started taking payments in kind. This in turn provoked a German strike. These events coincided with Adolf Hitler’s coup attempt in Munich, which was applauded by those in Germany who had remained bitterly opposed to the peace settlement. It seemed as if the French-German antagonism might deal a fatal blow to the postwar peace.","['1920', '1923']",meantime europe postwar peace remain fragile immediate aftermath versaille conference 1920 league ’s reparation commission set figure 33 billion sum germany pay enemy reparation germans refuse consider figure exorbitant resort print money sabotage reparation payment anger 1923 french belgian troop occupy ruhr valley industrial center start take payment kind turn provoke german strike event coincide adolf hitler ’s coup attempt munich applaud germany remain bitterly oppose peace settlement french german antagonism deal fatal blow postwar peace,76,"[1920, 1923]",1922,2,1925,1950
792,"Fortunately, the crisis abated once the United States stepped in, not through formal diplomacy but, as will be described in the next chapter, through “the diplomacy of the dollar.” The upshot was that in 1925 the governments of Germany, France, and Belgium signed treaties at Locarno to freeze and mutually guarantee their respective frontiers. This paved the way for Germany’s admission into the League, which came in 1926. Within Germany, Hitler was imprisoned, and those, principally in the army, who remained adamant about getting rid of the Versailles restrictions were replaced by those more willing to accept the new status quo. Although the role of the United States in this settlement was financial rather than political, Washington welcomed the Locarno agreements and hailed German reintegration into the European order. The Weimar Republic’s policy of economic recovery and political reconciliation fitted nicely into American conceptions of postwar international order, as did France’s willingness, under Foreign Minister Aristide Briand, to build its security on a solid understanding with Germany.","['1925', '1926']",fortunately crisis abate united state step formal diplomacy describe chapter diplomacy dollar ” upshot 1925 government germany france belgium sign treaty locarno freeze mutually guarantee respective frontier pave way germany ’s admission league come 1926 germany hitler imprison principally army remain adamant get rid versaille restriction replace willing accept new status quo role united state settlement financial political washington welcome locarno agreement hail german reintegration european order weimar republic ’s policy economic recovery political reconciliation fit nicely conception postwar international order france ’s willingness foreign minister aristide briand build security solid understanding germany,93,"[1925, 1926]",1926,2,1950,1950
793,"As will be seen, these agreements did not immediately produce a peaceful environment in Asia; Chinese nationalists sought a more rapid and radical change in the treaties, and the Soviet Union encouraged their assault on the Washington treaties. Nevertheless, “the Washington system” worked as well as “the Locarno system” in giving definition to the postwar regional order. A good indication of this was that Japanese diplomacy became much more cooperative during the 1920s than earlier and that there were few acts of overt military aggression on the part of the Japanese army against China. The Chinese, for their part, in the end accepted the Washington treaties as the basis for their diplomacy. When the Nationalists came to power in Nanking (Nanjing) in 1928, the United States quickly recognized the new regime and began negotiations for treaty revision, steps that were followed by other countries.7","['the 1920s', '1928']",see agreement immediately produce peaceful environment asia chinese nationalist seek rapid radical change treaty soviet union encourage assault washington treaty “ washington system ” work “ locarno system ” give definition postwar regional order good indication japanese diplomacy cooperative 1920s earlier act overt military aggression japanese army china chinese end accept washington treaty basis diplomacy nationalist come power nanking nanjing 1928 united state quickly recognize new regime begin negotiation treaty revision step follow countries.7,74,"[1920, 1928]",1924,2,1925,1950
794,"To be sure, the United States still upheld the Monroe Doctrine as the key to its policy in the region, but its meaning underwent significant changes. Rather than safeguarding the tenet of the Roosevelt Corollary to the doctrine that had justified military intervention and fiscal tutelage of some Caribbean states, officials in Washington came to view the Monroe Doctrine as an expression of pan-American solidarity and cooperation. Thus the United States convened a meeting of Central American states in Washington during 1922–3 so as to promote general disarmament and arbitration. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes declared that the Monroe Doctrine did not mean the establishment of protectorates or overlordships in American republics. And in 1928, J. Reuben Clark, undersecretary of state, wrote a memorandum arguing that intervention under the cloak of the Monroe Doctrine was wrong. He asserted that the doctrine must go back to the pre–Roosevelt Corollary days. That same year, after he won the presidential election, Herbert Hoover toured Latin America and stressed the concept of “the good neighbor.” He voiced his opposition to the policy of intervention itself, and in fact there was to be no military intervention in Latin America under his presidency.8","['1928', 'That same year']",sure united state uphold monroe doctrine key policy region meaning undergo significant change safeguard tenet roosevelt corollary doctrine justify military intervention fiscal tutelage caribbean state official washington come view monroe doctrine expression pan solidarity cooperation united state convene meeting central state washington 1922–3 promote general disarmament arbitration secretary state charles evans hughe declare monroe doctrine mean establishment protectorate overlordship republic 1928 j. reuben clark undersecretary state write memorandum argue intervention cloak monroe doctrine wrong assert doctrine pre – roosevelt corollary day year win presidential election herbert hoover tour latin america stress concept “ good neighbor voice opposition policy intervention fact military intervention latin america presidency.8,105,[1928],1928,1,1950,1950
795,"The steady building up of systems of international cooperation and peace in various regions of the world was given a symbolic reaffirmation when thirty-three countries, including the United States and even the Soviet Union, signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact (the so-called Pact of Paris) in 1928. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Briand drafted the document as a statement of hope that war could be outlawed. It declared that the signatories “condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.” In addition, they agreed that “the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts … shall never be sought except by pacific means.” These words sounded too idealistic even for that period, and many American observers noted that such a paper peace was dangerous because it could lead people to think they no longer needed to be militarily armed. But others, notably Senator Borah, were quite serious and believed this sort of internationalism was even more realistic and just than the League-defined world order. In time the Kellogg-Briand Pact would become codified in international law in that it would be cited as one of the key documents with which to condemn the aggressors in World War II. There is little doubt, in any event, that the Pact of Paris was another reflection of the earnest efforts made during the 1920s to solidify the structure of the new peace.","['1928', 'the 1920s']",steady building system international cooperation peace region world give symbolic reaffirmation thirty country include united state soviet union sign kellogg briand pact call pact paris 1928 secretary state frank b. kellogg french foreign minister briand draft document statement hope war outlaw declare signatory “ condemn recourse war solution international controversy renounce instrument national policy relation ” addition agree settlement solution dispute conflict … shall seek pacific mean ” word sound idealistic period observer note paper peace dangerous lead people think longer need militarily armed notably senator borah believe sort internationalism realistic league define world order time kellogg briand pact codify international law cite key document condemn aggressor world war ii little doubt event pact paris reflection earnest effort 1920s solidify structure new peace,123,"[1928, 1920]",1924,2,1925,1950
796,"What had happened? There certainly had been little change in American policy toward the Bolsheviks. Although some Republican leaders, notably Senator Borah, favored a change in Wilson’s anti-Bolshevik stand, the successive Republican administrations during the 1920s adhered to the policy that the Soviet Union would not be recognized unless certain essential conditions were met: agreement on repayment of outstanding debts, compensation for nationalized enterprises, and a pledge not to engage in propaganda activities in the United States. Such a rigid stance all but ensured that there would be no establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow.

The upshot was the radicalization of Chinese nationalism, turning China’s leaders and public opinion against the Washington Conference treaties that had provided the framework for international cooperation in China. Chinese officials, students, merchants, and other groups condemned the Washington treaties as totally inadequate, and the Nationalists and Communists combined their forces to launch a massive antiimperialistic campaign in the mid-1920s. They attacked American, European, and Japanese personnel and property in China, forcing a large-scale evacuation of foreign merchants and missionaries from the interior of the country.",['the mid-1920s'],phenomenon particularly notable china soviet union successfully establish tie center power government peking warlord control province guomindang kuomintang nationalist canton area nascent chinese communist party upshot radicalization chinese nationalism turn china ’s leader public opinion washington conference treaty provide framework international cooperation china chinese official student merchant group condemn washington treaty totally inadequate nationalist communist combine force launch massive antiimperialistic campaign mid-1920 attack european japanese personnel property china force large scale evacuation foreign merchant missionary interior country,77,[1920],1920,1,1925,1950
799,"Although more limited in scale, equally serious for the United States was what the State Department termed, in a 1927 report, “Bolshevik aims and policies in Mexico and Central America.” Because the Mexican constitution of 1917 had stipulated that all rights to the country’s subsoil resources belonged to the state, there continued a bitter dispute between Mexico and the United States over American property rights and concessions in the country, particularly the mining and refining of petroleum. Neither Alvaro Obregón, coming to power in 1920, nor Plutarco Elias Calles, who succeeded him in 1924, was willing to accept the American contention that the principle of nationalization should not be applied retroactively to rights Americans had held prior to 1917. Such an adamant stand the State Department was prone to attribute to Bolshevik influence, which certainly did exist, though not to the same extent as in China. Moreover, the United States suspected that Communist agents from Russia and North America were behind Mexico’s support of a faction in Nicaragua against the established regime.","['1927', '1917', '1920', '1924', '1917']",limited scale equally united state state department term 1927 report “ bolshevik aim policy mexico central america ” mexican constitution 1917 stipulate right country ’s subsoil resource belong state continue bitter dispute mexico united state property right concession country particularly mining refining petroleum alvaro obregón come power 1920 plutarco elias calles succeed 1924 willing accept contention principle nationalization apply retroactively right american hold prior 1917 adamant stand state department prone attribute bolshevik influence certainly exist extent china united state suspect communist agent russia north america mexico ’s support faction nicaragua establish regime,92,"[1927, 1917, 1920, 1924, 1917]",1921,5,1925,1950
800,"Such exaggerated fears of radical nationalism, however, did not last long, nor did violent anti-foreignism in these countries remain unchanged when some of its exponents came to positions of power. By the late 1920s, American officials had come to recognize that rather than maintaining an antagonistic relationship with radical forces in China, Mexico, and elsewhere, a relationship that might conceivably lead to war, it would be much better if some compromise could be worked out through close economic ties. It so happened that in these countries forces looking to make some accommodation with the United States and other capitalist powers steadily gained influence. Known as the “national development wing” in Mexico, these forces were first and foremost intent upon economic development and ready to moderate their nationalism in order to obtain goods, capital, and technology from the advanced countries, above all the United States.10 Representing this new development, Calles was ready for a reconciliation with Washington, and the latter eagerly obliged, President Calvin Coolidge sending a Wall Street banker, Dwight W. Morrow, as new ambassador to Mexico in 1927 to work out a compromise settlement of the petroleum question. Morrow was quite successful, a good indication of the shared interests between Mexican nationalists and American business leaders. Similarly, in China, when the Nationalists unified the country in 1928, their leader, Chiang Kai-shek, quickly took steps to conciliate the United States in order to entice American financiers and engineers to invest in the country’s modernization. Americans were eager to reciprocate such overtures, and indeed the United States was the first among the principal capitalist nations to extend recognition to the new regime in Nanking and signal its willingness to modify the existing treaties.","['the late 1920s', '1927', '1928']",exaggerated fear radical nationalism long violent anti foreignism country remain unchanged exponent come position power late 1920 official come recognize maintain antagonistic relationship radical force china mexico relationship conceivably lead war good compromise work close economic tie happen country force look accommodation united state capitalist power steadily gain influence know “ national development wing ” mexico force foremost intent economic development ready moderate nationalism order obtain good capital technology advanced country united states.10 represent new development calle ready reconciliation washington eagerly oblige president calvin coolidge send wall street banker dwight w. morrow new ambassador mexico 1927 work compromise settlement petroleum question morrow successful good indication share interest mexican nationalist business leader similarly china nationalist unify country 1928 leader chiang kai shek quickly take step conciliate united state order entice financier engineer invest country ’s modernization american eager reciprocate overture united state principal capitalist nation extend recognition new regime nanking signal willingness modify exist treaty,154,"[1920, 1927, 1928]",1925,3,1950,1950
801,"Against such a background, the Soviet Union’s joining other countries in signing the Pact of Paris was symbolic of the changing state of relations between that country and the rest of the world. It was as if the Soviets were now less intent on revolutionizing the globe than on consolidating their gains and stabilizing their foreign relations. That was in essence what Joseph Stalin implied when he began talking about “socialism in one country.” Rather than trying to turn all countries in the direction of socialism – a strategy still being advocated by Leon Trotsky, Stalin’s archrival in the struggle for power after Lenin’s death in 1924 – Russia would be content with its own survival as the sole socialist state. Stalin’s own survival became bound up with this, more modest goal. In any event, henceforth the Soviet Union, too, would focus on its domestic economic modernization rather than engaging in global revolutionary missions. It followed that Moscow now would be willing, indeed eager, to repair its relations with other countries. The result was that in this connection, too, stability returned to the international arena. Coupled with the successful conclusion of disarmament agreements and various other treaty arrangements for solidifying the new status quo, the Soviet Union was, by the end of the 1920s, willy-nilly playing a role in the consolidation of the postwar order.","['–', '1924 –', 'the end of the 1920s']",background soviet union ’s join country sign pact paris symbolic change state relation country rest world soviet intent revolutionize globe consolidate gain stabilize foreign relation essence joseph stalin imply begin talk “ socialism country ” try turn country direction socialism – strategy advocate leon trotsky stalin ’s archrival struggle power lenin ’s death 1924 – russia content survival sole socialist state stalin ’s survival bind modest goal event henceforth soviet union focus domestic economic modernization engage global revolutionary mission follow moscow willing eager repair relation country result connection stability return international arena couple successful conclusion disarmament agreement treaty arrangement solidify new status quo soviet union end 1920s willy nilly play role consolidation postwar order,114,"[1924, 1920]",1922,2,1925,1950

Indeed, given the devastation brought upon the European economies that had accounted for the bulk of the world economy, no postwar order could be conceived that did not address the question of how to restore the system of globalization that had existed for half a century or longer. How to restore the European economies and, through them, reglobalize the world economy were the key issues of the postwar period, the more so because, as noted earlier, the Versailles peace treaty had failed to address these problems squarely.","['the 1920s', 'half a century']",stable system international relation build economic foundation situation 1920s exception give devastation bring european economy account bulk world economy postwar order conceive address question restore system globalization exist half century long restore european economy reglobalize world economy key issue postwar period note earlier versaille peace treaty fail address problem squarely,50,[1920],1920,1,1925,1950
803,"Postwar reglobalization became particularly complicated because of the issues of German reparations and the allied war debts to the United States. As seen earlier, Germany was called upon to pay reparations totaling as much as $33 billion, which its leaders and people alike considered an outrageous sum. The British, the French, and the Italians, for their part, were adamant on the reparations question because their postwar economic recovery appeared to hinge on such payments. At the same time, these countries had borrowed much from the United States after 1917. As noted earlier, their indebtedness during 1917–20 had exceeded $10 billion. These loans had been extended at 5 percent interest. The Americans expected interest payments to continue, as well as the eventual repayment of all debts. The Europeans, however, insisted that they could not do so unless the interest rate were lowered and, more important, until they received reparations moneys from Germany.",['1917'],postwar reglobalization particularly complicated issue german reparation ally war debt united state see earlier germany call pay reparation total 33 billion leader people alike consider outrageous sum british french italian adamant reparation question postwar economic recovery appear hinge payment time country borrow united state 1917 note earlier indebtedness 1917–20 exceed 10 billion loan extend 5 percent interest american expect interest payment continue eventual repayment debt europeans insist interest rate lower important receive reparation money germany,75,[1917],1917,1,1925,1950
804,"This arrangement, an early example of “corporatism,” or a system of state-business cooperation, worked very well. In 1924 three bankers – Charles G. Dawes, Henry M. Robinson, and Owen D. Young – were asked by President Calvin Coolidge to organize themselves as a commission to investigate German finances. They went to Europe and proposed a revised schedule of German reparations payments, an arrangement that in effect would reduce the total amount Germany would be expected to pay. To enable the country to start reparations payments, the former allies would supervise plans for stabilizing German currency, including an immediate advance of foreign loans, the major portion consisting of a $110 million loan to be raised in the United States. American bankers had little difficulty making the loan, and thus the reparations settlement, known as the Dawes Plan, paved the way for stabilizing European financial as well as diplomatic affairs. Together with the settlement of the allied debt question, which was completed by 1926, the United States and the European nations were able to resume normal economic relations for the first time since the war.","['1924', '1926']",arrangement early example “ corporatism ” system state business cooperation work 1924 banker – charles g. dawes henry m. robinson owen d. young – ask president calvin coolidge organize commission investigate german finance go europe propose revised schedule german reparation payment arrangement effect reduce total germany expect pay enable country start reparation payment ally supervise plan stabilize german currency include immediate advance foreign loan major portion consist 110 million loan raise united state banker little difficulty make loan reparation settlement know dawes plan pave way stabilize european financial diplomatic affair settlement allied debt question complete 1926 united state european nation able resume normal economic relation time war,107,"[1924, 1926]",1925,2,1950,1950
805,"As if to commemorate the occasion, more than twenty nations decided to reestablish the gold standard. More correctly known as “the gold exchange standard,” the system lifted the wartime ban on shipments of gold, thereby restoring convertibility among different currencies. Their rates of exchange were more or less fixed through the medium of gold. That is to say, the value of a currency was determined by the price of gold in that currency, and its ratio of exchange with another currency would be the same as the comparative values of the two currencies in terms of gold. For instance, one ounce of gold was fixed at $20.67. In pounds sterling, one ounce would cost around 4.13 pounds. In other words, a pound was worth $5. This was the same as the prewar rate of exchange; both currencies were relinked to gold at “prewar par,” as it is sometimes written. Such a decision did not take into consideration wartime and postwar inflation. Because dollars or pounds bought less than before the war, their respective values in terms of gold might also have declined. To restore the gold standard at prewar par meant, therefore, to try to combat inflation by making money dearer, and prices of commodities lower. This practice could produce a recessionary trend, resulting in shortages of capital and also higher unemployment. But in the mid-1920s such a policy appeared to be a better alternative to inflation. Exchange stability, it seemed, had to be restored if normal international economic transactions were to be resumed, and such stability appeared to depend on maintaining the value of each currency as much as possible.",['the mid-1920s'],commemorate occasion nation decide reestablish gold standard correctly know “ gold exchange standard ” system lift wartime ban shipment gold restore convertibility different currency rate exchange fix medium gold value currency determine price gold currency ratio exchange currency comparative value currency term gold instance ounce gold fix 20.67 pound sterling ounce cost 4.13 pound word pound worth 5 prewar rate exchange currency relink gold “ prewar par ” write decision consideration wartime postwar inflation dollar pound buy war respective value term gold decline restore gold standard prewar par mean try combat inflation make money dear price commodity low practice produce recessionary trend result shortage capital high unemployment mid-1920 policy appear good alternative inflation exchange stability restore normal international economic transaction resume stability appear depend maintain value currency possible,128,[1920],1920,1,1925,1950
806,"Indeed, American capital was the main sustainer of the international economic system during the 1920s, in particular after 1924. The role of American financial resources has sometimes been referred to as “the diplomacy of the dollar.”3 The term signifies the fact that whereas the government in Washington refrained from active participation in world political affairs and was particularly sensitive about domestic opposition to working with the League of Nations, private bankers, speculators, and others were eager to make use of the opportunities presented for expanding their roles in economic transactions abroad. Starting with the 1924 loan of $110 million to Germany, American loans and investment overseas grew rapidly.","['the 1920s', '1924', '1924']",capital main sustainer international economic system 1920s particular 1924 role financial resource refer “ diplomacy dollar.”3 term signify fact government washington refrain active participation world political affair particularly sensitive domestic opposition work league nation private banker speculator eager use opportunity present expand role economic transaction abroad start 1924 loan 110 million germany loan investment overseas grow rapidly,57,"[1920, 1924, 1924]",1923,3,1925,1950

Both categories of investment grew in the 1920s so that, for instance, in 1929 alone American direct investment in Europe amounted to $1,352 million, and indirect investment to $3,030 million. Altogether, American funds totaling more than $10 billion (American billion) were being sent abroad – this at a time when the nation’s national income was about $80 billion.

808,"Whether, for the recipients of such funds, the continuous inflow of American capital in large amounts was a desirable development was seriously debated, but they really had little alternative, given the shortage of capital in war-devastated Europe and the fact that as late as 1929 the United States accounted for nearly 50 percent of the world’s income.

809,"In some such fashion, a revitalized global economy came to hinge on a relationship of financial interdependence between the United States and Europe – and indeed the rest of the world as well. Europe was particularly important as the inflow of American funds enabled Germany to pay reparations to Britain, France, and Italy, and the latter, in turn, paid back portions of their wartime debts to the United States. The mechanism depended on the continued flow of American capital and on the understanding among these countries of the essential interdependence. It was not surprising that in 1929 a new arrangement was worked out for German reparations. Known as the Young Plan, after the American banker, Owen Young, who helped arrange it, the plan reduced the reparations to about $9 billion, to be paid in fifty-nine years with an interest rate of 5.5 percent. Combined with the various debt settlements the United States and the wartime allies had by then negotiated, the 1929 arrangement epitomized the spirit of cooperation and the pivotal role played by the dollar in international affairs.","['1929', 'fifty-nine years', '1929']",fashion revitalize global economy come hinge relationship financial interdependence united state europe – rest world europe particularly important inflow fund enable germany pay reparation britain france italy turn pay portion wartime debt united state mechanism depend continue flow capital understanding country essential interdependence surprising 1929 new arrangement work german reparation know young plan banker owen young help arrange plan reduce reparation 9 billion pay year interest rate 5.5 percent combine debt settlement united state wartime ally negotiate 1929 arrangement epitomize spirit cooperation pivotal role play dollar international affair,88,"[1929, 1929]",1929,2,1950,1950
810,"American financial involvement in the Western Hemisphere was also extensive. In 1929, American direct investment in Canada amounted to $1,960 million, in Cuba and the West Indies to $1,054 million, in Mexico to $913 million, and in South America to $1,548 million. Nearly equal amounts were sent to these countries as indirect investments and governmental loans. Some of these were risky investments; in Argentina, for instance, there were so many business failures that the Commerce Department in Washington cautioned bankers against investing more money there.5 Still, these countries, too, could not have undertaken economic development programs without the massive infusion of American capital.",['1929'],"financial involvement western hemisphere extensive 1929 direct investment canada amount 1,960 million cuba west indie 1,054 million mexico 913 million south america 1,548 million nearly equal amount send country indirect investment governmental loan risky investment argentina instance business failure commerce department washington caution banker invest money there.5 country undertake economic development program massive infusion capital",55,[1929],1929,1,1950,1950
811,"Although smaller in scale than American investments in Europe or the Western Hemisphere, there was also an impressive outflow of capital to Asia and the Middle East. American funds sent to Japan were instrumental in enabling the country to recover from the devastating earthquake of 1923, which destroyed much of Tokyo and caused property damage upward of $1 billion (American billion). The Ford Motor Company built factories and manufactured the first automobiles in Japan, and Americans also invested in Japanese companies in chemical, electronic, and other enterprises that were fast industrializing and urbanizing the country. In China, in the meantime, American investment was particularly notable in providing utilities and telephone systems in the larger cities. The Standard Vacuum Oil Company engaged in the refinery business in the Dutch East Indies as well as on the continent of Asia. Altogether, close to $1 billion (American billion) was being invested in that part of the world on the eve of the Great Depression.","['1923', 'the eve of the Great Depression']",small scale investment europe western hemisphere impressive outflow capital asia middle east fund send japan instrumental enable country recover devastating earthquake 1923 destroy tokyo cause property damage upward 1 billion billion ford motor company build factory manufacture automobile japan american invest japanese company chemical electronic enterprise fast industrialize urbanize country china meantime investment particularly notable provide utility telephone system large city standard vacuum oil company engage refinery business dutch east indie continent asia altogether close 1 billion billion invest world eve great depression,83,[1923],1923,1,1925,1950
812,"The 1920s were also notable because American business interests, with the strong backing of the State and the Commerce departments, energetically entered the Middle Eastern oil fields. The region’s rich petroleum resources had been mostly divided up into British, French, and Dutch concessions, but the Americans, sensing an urgent need to supplement domestic with imported oil (the development of the automobile made this a clear requirement), energetically entered the field. Supported by the government, American companies succeeded in getting the Europeans to agree to a redrawing of the oil concessions map so as to make room for American companies. The so-called red-line agreement of 1928 defined where these four countries would have primary rights for the development of oil fields.6","['The 1920s', '1928']",1920s notable business interest strong backing state commerce department energetically enter middle eastern oil field region ’s rich petroleum resource divide british french dutch concession american sense urgent need supplement domestic import oil development automobile clear requirement energetically enter field support government company succeed get europeans agree redrawing oil concession map room company call red line agreement 1928 define country primary right development oil fields.6,65,"[1920, 1928]",1924,2,1925,1950
813,"Outside these regions, Liberia and the Soviet Union may be mentioned as significant examples of American economic activities during the 1920s. In the African republic, which had close historical ties to the United States, the main target was rubber plantations. Rubber was needed for automobile tires, but its production and pricing tended to be controlled by Britain, which possessed rich rubber resources within its Asian empire, especially Malaya. The Firestone Rubber Company kept in close touch with the Commerce Department as it developed rubber production facilities in Liberia. In the meantime, the Soviet Union, despite its antiimperialistic ideology, did not hesitate to turn to the United States for much of its needed capital. Although the absence of a diplomatic relationship meant binding legal contracts could not be worked out, this did not prevent American entrepreneurs and Soviet officials from concluding several business agreements. For instance, the Sinclair Oil Company obtained a concession to develop oil fields on northern Sakhalin; W. Averell Harriman invested in manganese mines; and, most famous of all, Henry Ford built tractor factories. Altogether, more than a hundred proposals for concessions in the Soviet Union were made by Americans from 1926 to 1929; in 1928 and 1929, there were fifty-four proposals, amounting to 26.1 percent of all foreign proposals during those years.7","['the 1920s', '1926 to 1929', '1928', '1929']",outside region liberia soviet union mention significant example economic activity 1920s african republic close historical tie united state main target rubber plantation rubber need automobile tire production pricing tend control britain possess rich rubber resource asian empire especially malaya firestone rubber company keep close touch commerce department develop rubber production facility liberia meantime soviet union despite antiimperialistic ideology hesitate turn united state need capital absence diplomatic relationship mean bind legal contract work prevent entrepreneur soviet official conclude business agreement instance sinclair oil company obtain concession develop oil field northern sakhalin w. averell harriman invest manganese mine famous henry ford build tractor factory altogether proposal concession soviet union american 1926 1929 1928 1929 proposal amount 26.1 percent foreign proposal years.7,119,"[1920, 1928, 1929]",1926,3,1950,1950
814,"If America’s foreign investment was a major international activity of the 1920s, one that undoubtedly contributed to world economic recovery and development, trade also played a pivotal role. World trade had suffered an overall decline during the European war, and it did not recover the prewar level until the second half of the 1920s. This was due to several factors: the devastations the war brought the European countries; their loss of millions of productive workers (and consumers); the chaotic state of foreign exchange in the absence of a gold exchange standard prior to 1925; the development of “import substituting” manufactures in many parts of the world that encouraged domestic production and discourage foreign imports. In the overall picture of trade stagnancy, however, the United States was almost always an exception. Its export trade, which expanded spectacularly during the war, slowed down somewhat after 1919, but the nation was still the principal exporter in the world, providing Europe with much of the necessities of life as well as industrial equipment and less tangible items like Hollywood movies.","['the 1920s', 'the second half of the 1920s', '1925', '1919']",america ’s foreign investment major international activity 1920s undoubtedly contribute world economic recovery development trade play pivotal role world trade suffer overall decline european war recover prewar level second half 1920s factor devastation war bring european country loss million productive worker consumer chaotic state foreign exchange absence gold exchange standard prior 1925 development “ import substitute ” manufacture part world encourage domestic production discourage foreign import overall picture trade stagnancy united state exception export trade expand spectacularly war slow somewhat 1919 nation principal exporter world provide europe necessity life industrial equipment tangible item like hollywood movie,96,"[1920, 1920, 1925, 1919]",1921,4,1925,1950
815,"American trade in the formerly European enclaves of the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia was still limited, but that in East Asia and the Western Hemisphere grew rapidly. Asia’s share in American export trade increased from 6 percent before the war to twice that proportion after the war, and in America’s imports, from 15 percent to 29 percent. Fully one-third of American exports were going to the countries of the Western Hemisphere at the end of the 1920s. These figures indicate that in trade relations, too, the United States was fast globalizing itself. World trade, on the whole, increased by only 13 percent between 1913 and 1929, whereas American trade more than doubled, and so one may well speculate as to whether global commerce would have expanded further if the prewar patterns of close U.S.-European trade links had been restored. What is indisputable is that the penetration of world markets by American goods as well as capital and technology was providing a basis, the economic foundation, for the postwar international order.","['the end of the 1920s', 'between 1913 and 1929']",trade european enclave middle east africa southeast asia limited east asia western hemisphere grow rapidly asia ’s share export trade increase 6 percent war twice proportion war america ’s import 15 percent 29 percent fully export go country western hemisphere end 1920s figure indicate trade relation united state fast globalize world trade increase 13 percent 1913 1929 trade double speculate global commerce expand prewar pattern close u.s .- european trade link restore indisputable penetration world market good capital technology provide basis economic foundation postwar international order,86,[1920],1920,1,1925,1950
816,"These economic activities, moreover, were sustained by an ethos, a mentality that played a unique role in the postwar world, in particular in the United States. At a League-sponsored world economic conference held in Geneva in 1927, for instance, the delegates recognized that international peace now depended on economic underpinnings. They set up a committee of experts to inquire into the commercial and financial arrangements best suited for achieving “understanding and harmony” among nations.8 Although the U.S. government did not participate in these activities, Americans certainly shared such a perspective. They developed what may be termed an idea of business civilization as the key to national and international affairs. To a nation weary of both geopolitics and an ideological crusade, the emphasis on economics was most welcome. Production, distribution, banking, and related business endeavors – as well as consumption, which was coming to be seen as the key to national economic health and growth – all seemed to exemplify rational action and provide an inspiration to the whole nation and a model for other countries. Such was the philosophy of business civilization that underlay American foreign relations during the 1920s.","['1927', 'the 1920s']",economic activity sustain ethos mentality play unique role postwar world particular united state league sponsor world economic conference hold geneva 1927 instance delegate recognize international peace depend economic underpinning set committee expert inquire commercial financial arrangement best suit achieve “ understanding harmony ” nations.8 u.s government participate activity american certainly share perspective develop term idea business civilization key national international affair nation weary geopolitic ideological crusade emphasis economic welcome production distribution banking relate business endeavor – consumption come see key national economic health growth – exemplify rational action provide inspiration nation model country philosophy business civilization underlay foreign relation 1920s,100,"[1927, 1920]",1924,2,1925,1950
817,"Herbert Hoover, Henry Ford, Walter Lippmann, and Reinhold Niebuhr, representing divergent backgrounds and engaged in different professions, may be taken as examples representing, each in his own way, this business philosophy. Hoover, secretary of commerce for eight years before becoming president in 1929, was a strong believer in private American initiatives – economic and humanitarian – that would contribute to a more stable and more prosperous world. What he termed “American individualism” relied not on governmental authority but on the self-interest and civic spirit of citizens who collectively would increase national wealth and make use of it for similar purposes elsewhere.9 Henry Ford preached the gospel of the new age of machinery, which he believed was promoting the cause of world progress. As he wrote, “Rightness in mechanics, Tightness in morals are basically the same thing.… Just as a clean factory, clean tools, accurate gauges, and precise methods of manufacture produce a smooth-working, efficient machine, so clear thinking, clear living, square dealing make of an individual or domestic life a successful one, smooth-running and efficient to everyone concerned.” Like Hoover, Ford believed that the United States had much to show other countries. Taylorism – after Frederick Taylor, who had disseminated ideas about efficient systems of production and of labor-management relations – symbolized the American way, but this was eminently exportable. As the industrialist noted, “[F]oreign lands are feeling the benefit of American progress, our American right thinking. Both Russia’s and China’s problems are fundamentally industrial and will be solved by the application of the right methods of thinking, practically applied.” It followed that “political boundaries and political opinions don’t really make much difference. It is the economic condition which really forces change and compels progress.”10 The philosophy of globalization could not have been better expressed.","['eight years', '1929', 'Taylorism –', '–']",herbert hoover henry ford walter lippmann reinhold niebuhr represent divergent background engage different profession take example represent way business philosophy hoover secretary commerce year president 1929 strong believer private initiative – economic humanitarian – contribute stable prosperous world term “ individualism ” rely governmental authority self interest civic spirit citizen collectively increase national wealth use similar purpose elsewhere.9 henry ford preach gospel new age machinery believe promote because world progress write “ rightness mechanic tightness moral basically thing … clean factory clean tool accurate gauge precise method manufacture produce smooth work efficient machine clear thinking clear living square deal individual domestic life successful smooth run efficient concerned ” like hoover ford believe united state country taylorism – frederick taylor disseminate idea efficient system production labor management relation – symbolize way eminently exportable industrialist note “ f]oreign land feel benefit progress right thinking russia ’s china ’s problem fundamentally industrial solve application right method thinking practically apply ” follow “ political boundary political opinion not difference economic condition force change compel progress.”10 philosophy globalization better express,175,[1929],1929,1,1950,1950
818,"Whether the “economic age” would really make the Versailles peace more durable would depend in part on the continued economic strength of the United States and in part on the latter’s willingness to heed “the desires and needs of others,” in Niebuhr’s words. Until the onset of the Depression in 1929, the first condition was clearly present, so the crucial question was the second, whether American economic policies served the interests of the world community. Did the United States pursue policies that tended to promote the further interdependence of the world economy, besides contributing to the nation’s own enrichment?

821,"To take a typical example, in 1928 America’s balance of trade was $880 million in its favor, and Americans sent some $970 million abroad as loans and investments, as if to help other countries pay for their trade deficits toward the United States.12 This situation was different from Britain’s before the war. Prior to 1914, London had been the financial capital of the world, lending and investing its funds in the United States and elsewhere. The recipient countries of these funds had been able to make payments on them through building up trade surpluses vis-à-vis Britain, which practiced a liberal commercial policy and tended to develop trade deficits with the borrowers. This was how Britain functioned as the economic hegemon and contributed to world stability, at least in the commercial and financial realms. After the war, however, the United States became a different sort of hegemon because of its protectionist tariffs. European critics, as well as those Americans who shared their views, argued that this was an untenable situation, making other countries, especially those in Europe, so much more dependent on the United States. The image of America as self-centered and insufficiently concerned with the larger picture emerged.","['1928', 'Prior to 1914']",typical example 1928 america ’s balance trade 880 million favor american send 970 million abroad loan investment help country pay trade deficit united states.12 situation different britain ’s war prior 1914 london financial capital world lending invest fund united state recipient country fund able payment build trade surplus vis à vis britain practice liberal commercial policy tend develop trade deficit borrower britain function economic hegemon contribute world stability commercial financial realm war united state different sort hegemon protectionist tariff european critic american share view argue untenable situation make country especially europe dependent united state image america self center insufficiently concerned large picture emerge,103,"[1928, 1914]",1921,2,1925,1950
822,"Defenders of the system, for their part, pointed out that there was nothing wrong with the arrangement; so long as Americans continued to send funds abroad, other countries could balance their books. Of course, these latter would have to pay interest and dividends on American loans and investments; in 1928, such payments amounted to $800 million. Was this not impoverishing America’s debtors? Americans would counter by noting that they were also spending money abroad as tourists (this came to $660 million in 1928), and recent immigrants from Europe were remitting substantial portions of their savings to the mother countries ($220 million). If these financial arrangements could have been made to continue, one might well have argued that, although protectionism in theory militated against economic globalization, this U.S.-centered system was, at least for the time being, as effective an instrument of ensuring orderly international business transactions as the prewar global arrangements sustained by Britain’s free trade policy.","['1928', '1928']",defender system point wrong arrangement long american continue send fund abroad country balance book course pay interest dividend loan investment 1928 payment amount 800 million impoverish america ’s debtor american counter note spend money abroad tourist come 660 million 1928 recent immigrant europe remit substantial portion saving mother country 220 million financial arrangement continue argue protectionism theory militate economic globalization u.s .- center system time effective instrument ensure orderly international business transaction prewar global arrangement sustain britain ’s free trade policy,81,"[1928, 1928]",1928,2,1950,1950

In a pamphlet he published in 1924 (Foundations of Leninism), he repeated the standard Leninist argument that “colonial and dependent countries” must “wage a struggle for liberation” from “a world system of financial enslavement and colonial oppression … by a handful of ‘advanced countries.’” At the same time, Stalin wrote, separate national economies and national territories had been integrated to create “a single chain called world economy,” out of which “true internationalism” might emerge, an internationalism of “national liberation movements.” Before the oppressed peoples of the world achieved such a goal, however, they should learn to combine “Russian revolutionary sweep” and “American efficiency.” This latter, he explained, was “that indomitable force which neither knows nor recognizes obstacles; which with its businesslike perseverance brushes aside all obstacles; which continues at a task once started until it is finished, even if it is a minor task; and without which serious constructive work is inconceivable.”13 Such a statement in a sense accommodated revolutionary nationalism with the American business ethos and could, if needed, have provided justification to leaders in non-Western parts of the world for accepting goods, capital, technology, and management skills from the United States.",['1924'],interesting observe connection joseph stalin come grudgingly admire capitalism pamphlet publish 1924 foundation leninism repeat standard leninist argument “ colonial dependent country ” “ wage struggle liberation ” “ world system financial enslavement colonial oppression … handful advanced countries.’ ” time stalin write separate national economy national territory integrate create “ single chain call world economy ” “ true internationalism ” emerge internationalism “ national liberation movement ” oppressed people world achieve goal learn combine “ russian revolutionary sweep ” “ efficiency ” explain “ indomitable force know recognize obstacle businesslike perseverance brush aside obstacle continue task start finish minor task constructive work inconceivable.”13 statement sense accommodate revolutionary nationalism business ethos need provide justification leader non western part world accept good capital technology management skill united state,127,[1924],1924,1,1925,1950
824,"If, then, American economic influence was linking different parts of the world closer together, thereby creating a greater sense of global interdependence, there was a contrary trend as well: the new immigration policy of the United States. Both the 1921 and the 1924 immigration laws established a quota system on the basis of nationality. Henceforth only those from Western and Central Europe would be welcomed, and even they could not exceed the total combined figure of 150,000 annually. Immigrants from Eastern Europe would be severely restricted. Asians were excluded entirely. (The quota system, however, did not apply to Canada or to Latin America.) Such legislation, enacted by a nation that was the richest in the world, could not but impress other countries as narrow-minded and self-centered, an unfortunate impression given America’s active promotion of international economic interchanges on many fronts. For the countries of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, in particular, the near-total exclusion of their people from the United States was in sharp contrast to their growing commercial ties with the latter, as good an example as any of the tension between nationalism and internationalism in American foreign affairs, in other words, between forces resisting and promoting reglobalization.","['1921', '1924']","economic influence link different part world closer create great sense global interdependence contrary trend new immigration policy united state 1921 1924 immigration law establish quota system basis nationality henceforth western central europe welcome exceed total combine figure 150,000 annually immigrant eastern europe severely restrict asian exclude entirely quota system apply canada latin america legislation enact nation rich world impress country narrow minded self center unfortunate impression give america ’s active promotion international economic interchange front country asia africa middle east particular near total exclusion people united state sharp contrast grow commercial tie good example tension nationalism internationalism foreign affair word force resist promote reglobalization",104,"[1921, 1924]",1922,2,1925,1950
825,"It was after 1919, however, that the idea of peace, of whatever shade of meaning, came to hold center stage in discussions about international affairs. We have already seen how potent were the drives for disarmament, outlawry of war, economic reintegration, and American capital movements, which together created an environment more conducive to peaceful interconnections among nations than to war and military preparedness. But the phenomenon had deep cultural roots as well and was sustained by intellectual developments in the 1920s. One might think of the ideology of peace at that time as a “hegemonic ideology” – the term Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Marxist, began to use as he penned his thoughts in prison.1 According to him, a society was held together through a set of ideas produced, refined, and manipulated by its elites in order to maintain some sort of order and cohesiveness. These ideas were so pervasive that even those opposed to the elites employed them consciously or unconsciously. An ideology, therefore, was more than a product of a class, an expression of its interests; at the same time, it was far more precise than people’s collective ethos vaguely defined. An ideology had specific origins and objectives, expressing power relationships in society; it was also comprehensive so that even those without power would embrace it as a way of ordering social, national, or international events.","['1919', 'the 1920s']",1919 idea peace shade meaning come hold center stage discussion international affair see potent drive disarmament outlawry war economic reintegration capital movement create environment conducive peaceful interconnection nation war military preparedness phenomenon deep cultural root sustain intellectual development 1920s think ideology peace time “ hegemonic ideology ” – term antonio gramsci italian marxist begin use pen thought prison.1 accord society hold set idea produce refined manipulate elite order maintain sort order cohesiveness idea pervasive oppose elite employ consciously unconsciously ideology product class expression interest time far precise people ’s collective ethos vaguely define ideology specific origin objective express power relationship society comprehensive power embrace way order social national international event,110,"[1919, 1920]",1920,2,1925,1950
826,"Peace was such an ideology in the 1920s. Its origins, to be sure, were diverse, but to the extent that one can speak of elites in the more advanced countries of Europe, North America, or Asia, it would seem that they established the idea of peace as the overarching framework in terms of which national and international affairs were to be discussed. Peace, in other words, was elevated to the position of a privileged concept so that a world existing in peace was considered to be the normal and normative – of course, these were by no means identical – state of affairs, and war an aberration.",['the 1920s'],peace ideology 1920s origin sure diverse extent speak elite advanced country europe north america asia establish idea peace overarch framework term national international affair discuss peace word elevate position privileged concept world exist peace consider normal normative – course means identical – state affair war aberration,46,[1920],1920,1,1925,1950
827,"All this is quite clear, but how did ordinary citizens as well as the press and other public opinion makers relate themselves to such an ideology? How were they incorporated into the hegemonic ideological system? Of course, some were not; militant nationalists in France and Germany in the immediate postwar years, or radical antiimperialists in China, Mexico, and elsewhere, were exceptions. Even they, however, would in time come under the strong influence of the peace ideology, at least to the extent that they would feel themselves to be on the defensive, in need of justifying their opposition to the idea of peace as a normal state of affairs. By the time the Locarno treaties were signed in Europe, and certainly by 1928, when the Soviet Union joined thirty-two capitalist and developing nations in signing the Kellogg-Briand Pact, it may be said that peace had become the most dominant global ideology.","['the immediate postwar years', '1928']",clear ordinary citizen press public opinion maker relate ideology incorporate hegemonic ideological system course militant nationalist france germany immediate postwar year radical antiimperialist china mexico exception time come strong influence peace ideology extent feel defensive need justify opposition idea peace normal state affair time locarno treaty sign europe certainly 1928 soviet union join thirty capitalist develop nation sign kellogg briand pact say peace dominant global ideology,66,[1928],1928,1,1950,1950
828,"It is relevant to note in this context that women in various countries played an active part in promoting ideas about peace. Almost as soon as war ended in 1918, for instance, groups of women from Germany, France, and the United States got in touch with one another and initiated moves to bring about reconciliation, their idea being that while men fought wars, women could bring peace to the world.2 At that time, politics and diplomacy were still dominated by men; we should recall that women in the United States and European countries gained their suffrage only in the postwar years, and in most other parts of the world they did not enjoy such rights. But this did not prevent them from bestirring themselves on behalf of world peace. One of the earliest transnational women’s organizations, the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, had been established on the eve of the Great War, and it continued to agitate for peace even during the war. In the 1920s it was joined by other similar organizations in various countries that actively engaged themselves on behalf of such objectives as disarmament, international organizations, and peaceful resolution of disputes. Such organizations were a powerful force in support of governmental initiatives in these areas and prodded them to do even more. In the United States, peace activists such as Carrie Chapman Catt and Emily Balch combined pacifism and feminism, reflecting the view that a peaceful world and the equality of the sexes reinforced one another.3","['1918', 'years', 'the eve', 'the 1920s']",relevant note context woman country play active promote idea peace soon war end 1918 instance group woman germany france united state get touch initiate move bring reconciliation idea man fight war woman bring peace world.2 time politic diplomacy dominate man recall woman united state european country gain suffrage postwar year part world enjoy right prevent bestir behalf world peace early transnational woman ’s organization woman ’s international league peace freedom establish eve great war continue agitate peace war 1920 join similar organization country actively engage behalf objective disarmament international organization peaceful resolution dispute organization powerful force support governmental initiative area prod united state peace activist carrie chapman catt emily balch combine pacifism feminism reflect view peaceful world equality sex reinforce another.3,121,"[1918, 1920]",1919,2,1925,1950
829,"Nowhere was the subject more widely and enthusiastically taught than in the United States – a clear indication that its official abstention from the League of Nations did not mean the nation was not part of the intellectual climate of the time. On the contrary, through their scholarly and professional efforts, Americans may be said to have retained the intellectual leadership of the worldwide peace movement. A good example of this was the project undertaken by Quincy Wright and his colleagues at the University of Chicago for a massive study of war and peace. At that university a graduate program in international relations was launched in 1923, said to be the first of its kind in the United States (perhaps in the world as well). Wright directed the program, which brought together specialists in history, political science, anthropology, economics, sociology, and other disciplines. In 1926 they launched an ambitious project to examine all past wars, inquire into their immediate causes and broader circumstances, and list conditions that would ensure peace. The project was so open-ended that by the time it was completed, in 1942, the realities of world affairs had changed drastically from the more optimistic days of the mid-1920s. Nevertheless, such an enterprise was not an isolated phenomenon but was part of a global trend toward an intellectual understanding of war and peace.5","['1923', '1926', '1942', 'the more optimistic days of the mid-1920s']",subject widely enthusiastically teach united state – clear indication official abstention league nation mean nation intellectual climate time contrary scholarly professional effort american say retain intellectual leadership worldwide peace movement good example project undertake quincy wright colleague university chicago massive study war peace university graduate program international relation launch 1923 say kind united state world wright direct program bring specialist history political science anthropology economics sociology discipline 1926 launch ambitious project examine past war inquire immediate cause broad circumstance list condition ensure peace project open end time complete 1942 reality world affair change drastically optimistic day mid-1920 enterprise isolated phenomenon global trend intellectual understanding war peace.5,106,"[1923, 1926, 1942, 1920]",1928,4,1950,1950

During the 1920s a steadily increasing number of colleges and universities began offering courses in the histories and languages of Russia, China, Japan, and other non-Western countries. Newly created organizations for support of scholarly research, such as the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies, joined others like the Carnegie Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation, both founded just before the war, to encourage the initiation of such programs at selected centers of learning. (Andrew Carnegie, the steel manufacturer and founder of the Carnegie Corporation, always equated “peace” with “understanding,” believing that cross-border interaction and mutual knowledge enhanced chances for a peaceful world.)","['decade', 'the 1920s']",postwar decade give traditional term “ international understanding ” far intellectual educational connotation past believe chance world peace enhance people understand good refrain chauvinistic excess school curricula united state global trend 1920 steadily increase number college university begin offer course history language russia china japan non western country newly create organization support scholarly research social science research council council learn society join like carnegie corporation rockefeller foundation found war encourage initiation program select center learning andrew carnegie steel manufacturer founder carnegie corporation equate “ peace ” “ understanding ” believe cross border interaction mutual knowledge enhance chance peaceful world,99,[1920],1920,1,1925,1950
831,"The proposition that peace was an intellectual engagement led to a major contribution of the postwar period: the idea that cultural and intellectual cooperation among nations was an effective way of promoting peace. We may term this idea “cultural internationalism” – the view that cultural communication, understanding, and cooperation were fundamental preconditions of international peace and order. The League of Nations endorsed the idea at its very inception when its council declared in 1921, “[N]o association of nations can hope to exist without the spirit of reciprocal intellectual activity between its members.”7",['1921'],proposition peace intellectual engagement lead major contribution postwar period idea cultural intellectual cooperation nation effective way promote peace term idea “ cultural internationalism ” – view cultural communication understanding cooperation fundamental precondition international peace order league nation endorse idea inception council declare 1921 “ n]o association nation hope exist spirit reciprocal intellectual activity members.”7,54,[1921],1921,1,1925,1950
832,"This stress on the role of intellectuals as shapers of national and international affairs was a major theme running through the 1920s. The intellectuals enjoyed what Gramsci called “social hegemony”; in other words, they mediated between the power of the state and the masses composing the society. He distinguished between the state and “civil society,” the latter consisting of private individuals and groups not permeated by the power of the state. As intermediaries between the two, the intellectuals were in a position to narrow or widen the distance between them. And in the postwar world, it is not surprising that many writers believed that the state had grown too powerful and that in order to prevent another disastrous war, this trend must be reversed. The sovereign authority of the state must somehow be checked through an assertion of the rights of individuals, or civil society, through what G. Jellinek, a distinguished German jurist, called the “common consciousness of the community.”10 Only through curbing state sovereignty could there be international understanding and peace.

833,"Such views on intellectual cosmopolitanism, arguing for a new world order through curbing state power and nationalistic excesses, did not go unchallenged. In France, where the debate was particularly intense, nationalists insisted that the world was still divided into countries and that the primary responsibility of French intellectuals, at least, was to the French nation.11 In Germany, Carl Schmitt, among others, continued to argue that national power remained the key in a world defined by power.12 Of course, that was precisely why so many sought to redefine world affairs by curbing the authority of the state. The debate between traditional nationalists and postwar internationalists was inconclusive, but at least it would appear that by 1929, ten years after the conclusion of the war, cosmopolitan ideas had established a firm foothold and had to be taken seriously in any discussion of national and international affairs. Contrary views continued to be expressed, but the relatively small number of publications exalting the heroism of dying for one’s country – as, for example, René Quinton did in his book Maxims on War (1930), or Alfred Rosenberg in his The Myth of the Twentieth Century (1930) – suggests a tone of defensiveness against the prevailing intellectual climate of the time.","['1929', 'ten years', '1930', '1930']",view intellectual cosmopolitanism argue new world order curb state power nationalistic excess unchallenged france debate particularly intense nationalist insist world divide country primary responsibility french intellectual french nation.11 germany carl schmitt continue argue national power remain key world define power.12 course precisely seek redefine world affair curb authority state debate traditional nationalist postwar internationalist inconclusive appear 1929 year conclusion war cosmopolitan idea establish firm foothold take seriously discussion national international affair contrary view continue express relatively small number publication exalt heroism die ’s country – example rené quinton book maxim war 1930 alfred rosenberg myth twentieth century 1930 – suggest tone defensiveness prevail intellectual climate time,106,"[1929, 1930, 1930]",1930,3,1950,1950
834,"That climate was exemplified by the League’s committee on intellectual cooperation, which served throughout the interwar period as the headquarters for promoting cultural interchanges. A typical example of the committee’s activity was its sponsorship of open exchanges of views by some of the world’s leading intellectual and artistic figures. The best-known instance of this was the open exchange of letters between Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud in 1932 on war and peace. Although the exchange took place after the stability of international order had begun to be threatened by the Depression, the ideas the two expressed were typical of the optimism and faith of the 1920s. Both Einstein and Freud agreed that only through the active cooperation of internationalist-minded individuals and through the cultural enterprises they promoted would it be possible for humanity to rid itself of the scourge of war.","['1932', 'the 1920s']",climate exemplify league ’s committee intellectual cooperation serve interwar period headquarters promote cultural interchange typical example committee ’s activity sponsorship open exchange view world ’s lead intellectual artistic figure best know instance open exchange letter albert einstein sigmund freud 1932 war peace exchange take place stability international order begin threaten depression idea express typical optimism faith 1920s einstein freud agree active cooperation internationalist minded individual cultural enterprise promote possible humanity rid scourge war,73,"[1932, 1920]",1926,2,1950,1950
835,"Lesser minds than they were similarly active. In scores of countries leading scholars, artists, musicians, and others organized their respective national committees on intellectual cooperation to serve as liaisons between the League committee and the cultural communities of nations. And in Paris an international institute for intellectual cooperation was established and held numerous exhibits and symposia. (Out of these organizations and activities the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization was to be created in 1945.) There existed, moreover, a large number of international associations, the bulk of which were organized in the immediate aftermath of the war, that cemented ties among the world’s cultural figures: the International Office of Museums, the International Congress on Popular Arts, and the International Society of Contemporary Music, to cite a few examples. The philosophy behind all such bodies was the idea that “internationalizing” (a word that had been in the English language since the late nineteenth century but acquired its modern meaning in the 1920s) cultural affairs through collaborative endeavors was the surest way for achieving international understanding and hence a durable peace.","['1945', 'the late nineteenth century', 'the 1920s']",less mind similarly active score country lead scholar artist musician organize respective national committee intellectual cooperation serve liaison league committee cultural community nation paris international institute intellectual cooperation establish hold numerous exhibit symposia organization activity united nation educational scientific cultural organization create 1945 exist large number international association bulk organize immediate aftermath war cement tie world ’s cultural figure international office museum international congress popular art international society contemporary music cite example philosophy body idea “ internationalizing word english language late nineteenth century acquire modern meaning 1920s cultural affair collaborative endeavor sure way achieve international understanding durable peace,98,"[1945, 1920]",1932,2,1950,1950
836,"Americans were very much part of this cultural internationalism. Indeed, some of them went beyond the framework of internationalism and began speaking of transnationalism, that is, the idea that cross-border interchanges would enable people everywhere to transcend particularistic loyalties and to relate to one another as world citizens. Already during the war, Randolph Bourne had published an influential essay titled “Trans-National America” and urged his compatriots to consider their country as part and parcel of the whole world.13 After the war, which in a way had been a transnational experience for soldiers and civilians alike, he continued to stress the linkages across nations that would lead to a truly interdependent globe. Although most people continued to use the term “international” when they meant “transnational,” American intellectuals and educators were particularly active promoters of the cause. Raymond Fosdick of the Rockefeller Foundation represented the United States on the League’s committee on intellectual cooperation, and even after the Senate’s rejection of the Treaty of Versailles, Americans regularly attended the committee’s meetings. They also established a national committee on intellectual cooperation, of which James Shotwell long served as chairman. Besides participating in various international organizations, Americans organized some 350 associations devoted to furthering scholarly communication and international dialogue. Typical was the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR), which was established initially in Honolulu but then moved to New York. It was an association of Americans, Canadians, Europeans, and Asians interested in Pacific issues; the institute was designed to facilitate their dialogue in a nonpartisan setting. The IPR drew the participation of distinguished scholars, journalists, and business leaders from the United States and elsewhere, conducted research on current affairs affecting the region, and held biannual meetings for the exchange of opinions.14 Another important organization established in the 1920s, the Guggenheim Foundation, which awarded grants to scholars and artists, actively solicited research proposals from Latin American intellectuals.","['biannual', 'the 1920s']",american cultural internationalism go framework internationalism begin speak transnationalism idea cross border interchange enable people transcend particularistic loyalty relate world citizen war randolph bourne publish influential essay title “ trans national america ” urge compatriot consider country parcel world.13 war way transnational experience soldier civilian alike continue stress linkage nation lead truly interdependent globe people continue use term “ international ” mean “ transnational ” intellectual educator particularly active promoter because raymond fosdick rockefeller foundation represent united state league ’s committee intellectual cooperation senate ’s rejection treaty versaille american regularly attend committee ’s meeting establish national committee intellectual cooperation james shotwell long serve chairman participate international organization american organize 350 association devote further scholarly communication international dialogue typical institute pacific relation ipr establish initially honolulu move new york association american canadian europeans asian interested pacific issue institute design facilitate dialogue nonpartisan setting ipr draw participation distinguished scholar journalist business leader united state conduct research current affair affect region hold biannual meeting exchange opinions.14 important organization establish 1920s guggenheim foundation award grant scholar artist actively solicit research proposal latin intellectual,179,[1920],1920,1,1925,1950
837,"Had efforts at cultural communication and cooperation been limited to intellectuals and artists, their impact on world affairs might not have been substantial. A major characteristic of the 1920s was that cross-national interchanges went much beyond inter-elite endeavors and touched the lives of common people throughout the world. This can best be seen in the myriads of international efforts during the 1920s to combat hunger, disease, and other afflictions. As noted in Chapter 5, the League of Nations created a Health Organization to coordinate international efforts to deal with matters of public health, in particular the treatment and prevention of epidemic diseases. Although similar efforts had begun before the Great War, the postwar years saw some important achievements now that such activities could be coordinated by the international organization. The Health Organization served as the clearing house of information and contributed to standardizing medical data and standards throughout the world. It is important to note that Americans fully participated in such work, although officially their country was not a member of the League. The Rockefeller Foundation was a primary funder of the Health Organization’s activities and was instrumental, for instance, in the latter’s project to help develop public health institutions in China.15","['the 1920s', 'the 1920s', 'years']",effort cultural communication cooperation limit intellectual artist impact world affair substantial major characteristic 1920s cross national interchange go inter elite endeavor touch life common people world best see myriad international effort 1920s combat hunger disease affliction note chapter 5 league nation create health organization coordinate international effort deal matter public health particular treatment prevention epidemic disease similar effort begin great war postwar year see important achievement activity coordinate international organization health organization serve clearing house information contribute standardize medical datum standard world important note american fully participate work officially country member league rockefeller foundation primary funder health organization ’s activity instrumental instance ’s project help develop public health institution china.15,110,"[1920, 1920]",1920,2,1925,1950
838,"It is perhaps pertinent to note that no American had won the Nobel Prize in medicine before 1930. Since the prize was established in 1901, this means that for the first thirty years, arguably the highest honor in the field of medical research had gone to non-Americans (virtually all of them Europeans). This might indicate that in this field, as in various other areas of scholarship, America was still behind European nations. After 1930, however, there were to be more American winners of this prize than all the others put together, which might suggest that educational and research institutions in the United States after the Great War were training future leaders in this as well as in other scientific disciplines. In the field of public health, in any event, America already excelled in preventive medicine, hospital care, and hygiene, the more so as many research centers and hospitals in Europe had been destroyed by the war.","['1930', '1901', 'the first thirty years', '1930']",pertinent note win nobel prize medicine 1930 prize establish 1901 mean thirty year arguably high honor field medical research go non americans virtually europeans indicate field area scholarship america european nation 1930 winner prize suggest educational research institution united state great war train future leader scientific discipline field public health event america excel preventive medicine hospital care hygiene research center hospital europe destroy war,64,"[1930, 1901, 1930]",1920,3,1925,1950
839,"Americans were also active in other humanitarian efforts, for instance in providing food to war-devastated areas of Europe or assisting in the aftermath of the disastrous earthquake in Tokyo in 1923. American missionaries continued to engage in humanitarian work in China and India. Because these countries were particularly populous, there was a great need for taking care of children’s health and education. Somewhat more controversial were efforts by Margaret Sanger and others to spread information on birth control. Sanger founded the American Birth Control League in 1921 and was active in international conferences to consider the subject. During the decade she traveled to Japan, India, and other countries to spread her message. Her activities occasionally extended to eugenics, what was called the science of “race improvement.” She and her supporters argued that the earth could not sustain so many people, especially those who were not mentally and physically equipped to live productive lives. Limiting the number of children, and educating those who did live, was considered an urgent issue of the day, but because such views implied that many Asians and Africans were undeserving of life, or that even in the West only the “normal” people – with appropriate scores in intelligent tests – should be allowed to live, Sanger and her colleagues were fiercely criticized by humanitarian groups.16 Nevertheless, it is to be noted that in this, as in a growing number of other issues, American women came to gain unprecedented influence throughout the world.","['1923', '1921', 'the decade', 'the day']",american active humanitarian effort instance provide food war devastate area europe assist aftermath disastrous earthquake tokyo 1923 missionary continue engage humanitarian work china india country particularly populous great need take care child ’s health education somewhat controversial effort margaret sanger spread information birth control sanger found birth control league 1921 active international conference consider subject decade travel japan india country spread message activity occasionally extend eugenic call science “ race improvement ” supporter argue earth sustain people especially mentally physically equip live productive life limit number child educate live consider urgent issue day view imply asian african undeserving life west “ normal ” people – appropriate score intelligent test – allow live sanger colleague fiercely criticize humanitarian groups.16 note grow number issue woman come gain unprecedented influence world,128,"[1923, 1921]",1922,2,1925,1950
840,"America’s influence in the postwar world was nowhere more noticeable than in the areas of material and popular culture, an influence that was so pervasive that many abroad spoke of the Americanization of the world. To be sure, this was not a new phenomenon, even in the 1920s. As Emily Rosenberg, Jacques Portes, and others have noted, as early as the turn of the century foreign observers were remarking how pervasive the impact of American goods and ways of life had been throughout the world.17 The American people, who were already then enjoying the highest standard of living among all nations, were the object of envy elsewhere; they seemed to represent material prosperity, comfort, and a certain life-style free from Old World complications. Such products of modern technology as electricity, automobiles, and telephones, which for most countries did not arrive in large quantities until after the Great War, had become commonplace in America before the war. (There were, in the United States, 18 million light bulbs in 1902, 902,000 registered automobiles in 1912, and 10 million telephones in 1914.)","['the 1920s', 'the turn of the century', '1902', '1912', '1914']","america ’s influence postwar world noticeable area material popular culture influence pervasive abroad speak americanization world sure new phenomenon 1920s emily rosenberg jacques portes note early turn century foreign observer remark pervasive impact good way life world.17 people enjoy high standard live nation object envy represent material prosperity comfort certain life style free old world complication product modern technology electricity automobile telephone country arrive large quantity great war commonplace america war united state 18 million light bulb 1902 902,000 register automobile 1912 10 million telephone 1914",86,"[1920, 1902, 1912, 1914]",1912,4,1925,1950
841,"What was notable after 1919 was that these developments accelerated and that American influence now became undisputed because of the decline of European prestige. The so-called decline of the West, an idea made popular through the publication of Oswald Spengler’s book of that title in 1918, really meant the decline of Europe. Because of the war-related devastations and the partially successful attempts by non-Europeans to catch up with them in industrialization and trade, the Europeans felt themselves to be on the defensive, no longer the unquestioned center of civilization nor the foundation of wisdom. Indeed, it seemed that Europe had little to offer the world as it sought to reconstruct itself. The task of defining the peace – not only geopolitically but economically and culturally – would have to be entrusted to others, above all the United States.","['1919', '1918', '–']",notable 1919 development accelerate influence undisputed decline european prestige call decline west idea popular publication oswald spengler ’s book title 1918 mean decline europe war relate devastation partially successful attempt non europeans catch industrialization trade europeans feel defensive longer unquestioned center civilization foundation wisdom europe little offer world seek reconstruct task define peace – geopolitically economically culturally – entrust united state,61,"[1919, 1918]",1918,2,1925,1950
842,"And America, virtually unscathed by the war, was more than ever before the symbol of the new material and popular culture. In a pathbreaking study of a “typical” American community (actually Muncie, Indiana), the sociologists Robert and Helen Lynd noted, in the mid-1920s, the growing influence of “inventions imported from without – automobile, motion picture, and radio.”18 Imported from “without” (i.e., from other parts of the nation), these inventions were linking small towns to the outside world, making local citizens conscious of their interrelationships with people elsewhere. Although the Lynds were commenting on the homogenization of American culture, the same phenomenon could also be observed globally.","['the mid-1920s', '–']",america virtually unscathed war symbol new material popular culture pathbreaking study “ typical community actually muncie indiana sociologist robert helen lynd note mid-1920 grow influence “ invention import – automobile motion picture radio.”18 import “ ” i.e. part nation invention link small town outside world make local citizen conscious interrelationship people lynd comment homogenization culture phenomenon observe globally,58,[1920],1920,1,1925,1950
843,"The automobile, the motion picture, and the radio – these three artifacts that were linking Americans in different parts of the country – were also serving the same function in the wider world.

844,"Even those who were appalled at such a phenomenon unwittingly acknowledged the unmistakable influence of American culture when they denounced it as detrimental to maintaining the cultural integrity of their own countries. In one example, two French writers published a book titled The American Cancer in 1930 and asserted that France was being colonized by the United States through the ideas of productivity and efficiency. The “new feudalism,” they argued, of bankers, commerce, and industry, with their emphasis on mechanization, was stifling the true spirit of the French Revolution, embodied in the principles of individuality and human rights: “The principal means of the American conquest whose menace weighs over Europe and the whole world is not so much brute force as the American spirit, its cult of blind reason and rational construction.” France, the authors concluded, was now under the tutelage of “Yankee inspiration and direction,” where the people were demoralized and lay at the service of a cosmopolitan plutocracy.20",['1930'],appal phenomenon unwittingly acknowledge unmistakable influence culture denounce detrimental maintain cultural integrity country example french writer publish book title cancer 1930 assert france colonize united state idea productivity efficiency “ new feudalism ” argue banker commerce industry emphasis mechanization stifle true spirit french revolution embody principle individuality human right “ principal mean conquest menace weigh europe world brute force spirit cult blind reason rational construction ” france author conclude tutelage “ yankee inspiration direction ” people demoralize lie service cosmopolitan plutocracy.20,81,[1930],1930,1,1950,1950
845,"One would never know whether the collapse of the world economy, which had barely begun to be reglobalized, in the years following 1929 was more or less preordained by the very structure of economic affairs during the 1920s, or whether the prosperity and peace of the postwar decade could somehow have been maintained if the United States and other nations had taken more forceful measures to cope with the economic crisis at its inception. The postwar global economy had some advantages over the prewar globalization – such as its functioning in a better international political climate (at least after 1925) – but it had one serious problem: its excessive dependence on the United States. The world economy of the 1920s was so intertwined with American economic resources and performance that whether the relative stability and prosperity of the postwar decade could be perpetuated hinged to a considerable extent on action taken by American officials, bankers, and others.

And, indeed, something drastic did take place; after the New York stock market crash of October 1929, industrial production in the United States was cut by 50 percent by 1932, export trade fell by 60 percent, and unemployment rose from 1.5 million to 12 million in the same period.

847,"Much of this, though not its scale, could have been foreseen. The speculative boom preceding the crash had been fed by low interest rates, which banks adopted to make it easier for individuals and factories to borrow money; the policy attracted American capital away from foreign investment markets and fueled the boom. Had the banks retained higher interest rates, some of this might not have happened, although if the rates had been noticeably higher than the returns on investments abroad, this, too, might have brought American capital home and created a speculative atmosphere. Even more serious was the fact that during the 1920s, despite the overall growth of the American economy, the average purchasing power had not kept pace, and in some sectors, especially agricultural, there had been overproduction, depressing farm income. Farmers, factory workers, and shopkeepers had tended to spend more than they earned and were chronically in debt. The popularity of consumer goods, ranging from automobiles to vacation homes, signaled the arrival of what would later come to be called a postindustrial age, or consumer society. Such purchases were often financed through the system of installment payment, an innovation of the 1920s, wherein consumers borrowed money in order to buy goods. But toward the end of the decade, many of them also borrowed to speculate in the stock market. All these combined not only to create the panic of 1929 but also to bring about not just a temporary readjustment of the stock market but wholesale bankruptcies and disequilibriums at all levels of the economy.","['the 1920s', 'the 1920s', 'the end of the decade', '1929']",scale foresee speculative boom precede crash feed low interest rate bank adopt easy individual factory borrow money policy attract capital away foreign investment market fuel boom bank retain high interest rate happen rate noticeably high return investment abroad bring capital home create speculative atmosphere fact 1920s despite overall growth economy average purchasing power keep pace sector especially agricultural overproduction depress farm income farmer factory worker shopkeeper tend spend earn chronically debt popularity consumer good range automobile vacation home signal arrival later come call postindustrial age consumer society purchase finance system installment payment innovation 1920s consumer borrow money order buy good end decade borrow speculate stock market combine create panic 1929 bring temporary readjustment stock market wholesale bankruptcy disequilibrium level economy,120,"[1920, 1920, 1929]",1923,3,1925,1950
848,"The postwar international system, which had been based on multilateral trade, currency convertibility, and the free flow of capital from one country to another, now became unhinged. World trade shrank from $30.3 billion in 1929 to $20.3 billion in 1931; Germany’s capital imports fell from $967 million in 1928 to only $482 million in 1929, and further to $129 million in 1930. By 1932 the United States, the major provider of capital not only to Germany but to most other countries, had virtually stopped investing its funds overseas. The dwindling trade and capital movement severely strained the gold exchange standard, the mainstay of postwar multilateralism. Nations were now unwilling or incapable of making their payments in gold – unwilling because they feared that the draining of gold out of the country would cause further loss of confidence in the economy, incapable because in some countries (Austria, then Britain) central banks lost their gold holdings because of panic “runs” on gold. The result was that by 1932 several nations (including Germany and Japan – the latter had readopted the gold standard only in 1930 – in addition to Austria and Britain) had abandoned the gold exchange standard; international transactions would no longer be conducted in terms of gold-defined fixed rates of exchange among different currencies but instead would be subject to fluctuating rates of exchange. Governments would be under pressure to inflate their currencies in order to make their respective commodities comparatively cheaper in the world market. “Managed currencies,” as the practice was called, would be one way of augmenting exports and reducing imports. For the same reason, governments would be tempted to legislate higher tariff rates so as to maintain a favorable balance of trade.","['1929', '1931', '1928', '1929', '1930', '1932', '–', '1932', '1930']",postwar international system base multilateral trade currency convertibility free flow capital country unhinged world trade shrink 30.3 billion 1929 20.3 billion 1931 germany ’s capital import fall 967 million 1928 482 million 1929 129 million 1930 1932 united state major provider capital germany country virtually stop invest fund overseas dwindle trade capital movement severely strain gold exchange standard mainstay postwar multilateralism nation unwilling incapable make payment gold – unwilling fear draining gold country because loss confidence economy incapable country austria britain central bank lose gold holding panic “ run ” gold result 1932 nation include germany japan – readopt gold standard 1930 – addition austria britain abandon gold exchange standard international transaction longer conduct term gold define fix rate exchange different currency instead subject fluctuate rate exchange government pressure inflate currency order respective commodity comparatively cheap world market “ manage currency ” practice call way augment export reduce import reason government tempt legislate high tariff rate maintain favorable balance trade,160,"[1929, 1931, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1932, 1932, 1930]",1930,8,1950,1950

And his initial reaction to the Depression suggested he had not changed his views. He sought to persuade the American people not to lose confidence in their economy, asserting that it was fundamentally in good shape. When unemployment nevertheless continued to grow, Hoover initiated a modest program of public works. He also supported a high-tariff policy. Even before the Wall Street crash, Congress had discussed raising tariffs, and in June 1930 a new schedule of import duties, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, was enacted. It raised rates on most commodities, especially sugar and textiles. The tariff had Hoover’s support, as he believed that it would protect domestic production, curtail imports, and contribute to expanding exports.2",['June 1930'],hoover see earlier economic internationalist albeit time high tariff advocate strongly believe role united state world economy initial reaction depression suggest change view seek persuade people lose confidence economy assert fundamentally good shape unemployment continue grow hoover initiate modest program public work support high tariff policy wall street crash congress discuss raise tariff june 1930 new schedule import duty smoot hawley tariff enact raise rate commodity especially sugar textile tariff hoover ’s support believe protect domestic production curtail import contribute expand exports.2,82,[1930],1930,1,1950,1950

Here Hoover’s response, while sensitive to domestic interests, was designed to restore the system of postwar international economic relations, which, he believed, had served the nation and the world so well. In June 1931, he proposed a one-year moratorium on payment of all intergovernmental debts and reparations. The moratorium went into effect in July, by which time German banks had been closed, followed in September by Britain’s decision to go off the gold standard. Clearly the Hoover moratorium was not sufficient to moderate the crisis, but at least it showed America’s willingness to cooperate with other countries to cope with the situation. Unilateral action was eschewed, and the governments tried desperately to save the basic structure of international economic transactions.","['June 1931', 'one-year', 'July', 'September']",meantime united state call reparation debt question grow chaos international monetary transaction hoover ’s response sensitive domestic interest design restore system postwar international economic relation believe serve nation world june 1931 propose year moratorium payment intergovernmental debt reparation moratorium go effect july time german bank close follow september britain ’s decision gold standard clearly hoover moratorium sufficient moderate crisis show america ’s willingness cooperate country cope situation unilateral action eschew government try desperately save basic structure international economic transaction,79,[1931],1931,1,1950,1950
851,"The moratorium, in any event, was a temporary palliative, and the European nations convened a meeting in Lausanne in June 1932 to discuss the reparations and debt question. They agreed in reducing Germany’s reparations – if the United States likewise consented to renegotiate the debts of the allies. Hoover, however, refused to take precipitous action and agreed only to a six-month extension of the moratorium. When it expired in December 1932, he insisted that the former allies resume debt payments, and some did – Britain, Italy, Finland, and others – but not France. Hoover’s adamant position was in part based on his view that the debt payments would help balance the U.S. budget and bring about business recovery, but it was also part of his comprehensive strategy to deal with the reparations and debt questions in a larger framework of international cooperation in support of multilateralism.3","['June 1932', 'six-month', 'December 1932']",moratorium event temporary palliative european nation convene meeting lausanne june 1932 discuss reparation debt question agree reduce germany ’s reparation – united state likewise consent renegotiate debt ally hoover refuse precipitous action agree month extension moratorium expire december 1932 insist ally resume debt payment – britain italy finland – france hoover ’s adamant position base view debt payment help balance u.s budget bring business recovery comprehensive strategy deal reparation debt question large framework international cooperation support multilateralism.3,77,"[1932, 1932]",1932,2,1950,1950
852,"Much to his disappointment, Hoover lost the presidential election of November 1932 (even some of the outspoken internationalists deserted him), so that henceforth America’s economic policy would be shaped by his successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt. Hoover, however, did not lose his confidence in the multinational approach and sought to persuade the incoming president to prepare seriously for an international economic conference that was being planned by the League of Nations for mid-1933 in London, where trade, foreign exchange, reparations, debt, and other questions were to be discussed. Above all, Hoover wanted to make sure that the gold exchange standard would be restored as the key to economic recovery and restabilization. The nations of the world, he continued to argue, would have to agree to give up restrictive trade practices and regional arrangements and to readopt some system of fixed rates of exchange. It is to Hoover’s credit that, although none of these recommendations was initially adopted by Roosevelt, in time many of them would be accepted by the United States as well as other countries and form a basis of the revitalized global economy that came after another world war.","['November 1932', 'mid-1933']",disappointment hoover lose presidential election november 1932 outspoken internationalist desert henceforth america ’s economic policy shape successor franklin d. roosevelt hoover lose confidence multinational approach seek persuade incoming president prepare seriously international economic conference plan league nation mid-1933 london trade foreign exchange reparation debt question discuss hoover want sure gold exchange standard restore key economic recovery restabilization nation world continue argue agree restrictive trade practice regional arrangement readopt system fix rate exchange hoover ’s credit recommendation initially adopt roosevelt time accept united state country form basis revitalize global economy come world war,92,"[1932, 1933]",1932,2,1950,1950
853,"President Hoover had another idea about controlling the economic crisis: to encourage further disarmament. As noted in Chapter 5, the United States, Britain, and Japan had failed to come to terms on enlarging the scope of their disarmament agreement to cover the so-called auxiliary craft – light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. As soon as he became president, Hoover was determined to try again, and the third naval disarmament conference in ten years was convened in London in January 1930. Although initially disarmament was unrelated to the Depression, Hoover became convinced of the connection, believing that disarmament would enable governments to reduce public spending; balanced budgets were considered desirable if nations were to put an end to economic chaos, restore business confidence, and preserve the value of their currencies. Hoover was also beginning to make a connection between the settlement of the reparations and debt question and disarmament; he would be willing to consider reducing, even canceling, those payments only if the amounts thus saved would not go into armament. Thus, both in the naval disarmament conference of 1930 and in the general disarmament conference that the League of Nations convened in Geneva in 1932, Hoover showed an unusual interest. They were part of his strategy for economic recovery through international cooperation.","['ten years', 'January 1930', '1930', '1932']",president hoover idea control economic crisis encourage disarmament note chapter 5 united state britain japan fail come term enlarge scope disarmament agreement cover call auxiliary craft – light cruiser destroyer submarine soon president hoover determine try naval disarmament conference year convene london january 1930 initially disarmament unrelated depression hoover convinced connection believe disarmament enable government reduce public spending balanced budget consider desirable nation end economic chaos restore business confidence preserve value currency hoover begin connection settlement reparation debt question disarmament willing consider reduce cancel payment amount save armament naval disarmament conference 1930 general disarmament conference league nation convene geneva 1932 hoover show unusual interest strategy economic recovery international cooperation,109,"[1930, 1930, 1932]",1931,3,1950,1950
854,"In the 1930 naval conference, he could at least take pride, for it was a successful instance of cooperation – albeit with unforeseen consequences. The American, British, and Japanese delegations resolved their differences over the three navies’ respective sizes in different categories of ships. The Japanese navy had insisted on a 10:7 ratio in auxiliary craft, arguing that the 10:6 ratio adopted at the Washington Conference with regard to capital ships had already compromised national security. The American and British representatives believed that to grant Japan’s request would jeopardize their Pacific possessions’ security. Washington and London, for their part, had not resolved their differences over cruiser tonnages, an impasse that had brought about the failure of the 1927 Geneva Conference.","['1930', '1927']",1930 naval conference pride successful instance cooperation – albeit unforeseen consequence british japanese delegation resolve difference navies’ respective size different category ship japanese navy insist 10:7 ratio auxiliary craft argue 10:6 ratio adopt washington conference regard capital ship compromise national security british representative believe grant japan ’s request jeopardize pacific possessions’ security washington london resolve difference cruiser tonnage impasse bring failure 1927 geneva conference,64,"[1930, 1927]",1928,2,1950,1950
855,"As if this were not enough, an even graver crisis confronted the Japanese government as well as the international community in 1931. On September 18, the Japanese military force in Manchuria, the Kwantung Army, blew up a few feet of rail on the South Manchuria Railway near Mukden (Fengtian or Feng-t’ien) Station, seized the moment to create confusion in the city, and fought skirmishes with the Chinese contingents guarding the government offices. (Japanese forces had been stationed in Mukden since 1905, when, as a result of Japan’s victory over Russia, it took over the rights the latter had enjoyed in southern Manchuria since the late 1890s.) Thus began the Mukden incident, which quickly developed into a Manchurian crisis. The crisis involved Chinese-Japanese clashes throughout Manchuria and ended in an almost complete Japanese victory, because the Chinese forces in the region were too weak to put up resistance without support from those under the Nanking regime’s control, but the latter decided early on not to become militarily involved in the areas north of the Great Wall.5","['1931', 'September 18', '1905', 'the late 1890s']",grave crisis confront japanese government international community 1931 september 18 japanese military force manchuria kwantung army blow foot rail south manchuria railway near mukden fengtian feng t’ien station seize moment create confusion city fight skirmish chinese contingent guard government office japanese force station mukden 1905 result japan ’s victory russia take right enjoy southern manchuria late 1890 begin mukden incident quickly develop manchurian crisis crisis involve chinese japanese clash manchuria end complete japanese victory chinese force region weak resistance support nanking regime ’s control decide early militarily involved area north great wall.5,92,"[1931, 1905, 1890]",1909,3,1925,1950
856,"In the middle of the international economic crisis, there was little the United States and other nations could do to influence events in faraway Manchuria. Put another way, the Japanese army’s timing was well calculated to take advantage of the situation. The naval opposition to the London treaty had already weakened the civilian government, and the army had decided to vie with the navy for greater power and to add another blow to the party politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders, and intellectuals who had stood for a liberal political order at home and international cooperation abroad. It is no accident that, while planning for military action in Manchuria, some army and navy personnel were involved in a scheme – which proved abortive – to overthrow the government and to establish a military dictatorship. From the conspirators’ point of view, 1931 was as good a year as would ever present itself for such action. International cooperation, though achieved at the London Conference in 1930, had not been easy to maintain as the economic crisis worsened, and the world’s capitals were desperately trying to cope with the banking crises in Germany and Austria. (The Bank of England, it is to be noted, went off the gold standard on September 21, three days after the Mukden incident.) The Japanese activists correctly judged that other powers would be little inclined to become involved in the Manchurian conflict so long as they presented their action as a case of self-defense against Chinese attacks on the treaty rights.","['1931', '1930', 'September 21, three days']",middle international economic crisis little united state nation influence event faraway manchuria way japanese army ’s timing calculate advantage situation naval opposition london treaty weaken civilian government army decide vie navy great power add blow party politician bureaucrat business leader intellectual stand liberal political order home international cooperation abroad accident plan military action manchuria army navy personnel involve scheme – prove abortive – overthrow government establish military dictatorship conspirators’ point view 1931 good year present action international cooperation achieve london conference 1930 easy maintain economic crisis worsen world ’s capital desperately try cope banking crisis germany austria bank england note go gold standard september 21 day mukden incident japanese activist correctly judge power little inclined involved manchurian conflict long present action case self defense chinese attack treaty right,128,"[1931, 1930]",1930,2,1950,1950
857,"The initial reaction of Secretary of State Stimson, which was shared by most officials in Washington, was that the unilateral acts by the Kwantung Army would be checked by Tokyo’s civilian leaders. They had been quite cooperative during the 1920s, and Stimson could not believe that they would want to sanction any action that would undermine the framework of the Washington Conference treaties. But the Americans overestimated the Japanese government’s ability and willingness to rein in the military. The civilian leaders in Tokyo had been badly shaken by the London naval treaty episode. With public opinion expressing deep satisfaction with the military action to “punish China,” and with the opposition parties attacking the cabinet for its allegedly “weak-kneed” diplomacy, there was little inclination to heed Stimson’s wishes. Japan even sought to prevent the League of Nations from meeting to discuss the Mukden incident, preferring to settle the affair bilaterally with China. When the League nevertheless met and called on the two nations to agree to an immediate cease-fire, the Kwantung Army responded by extending the hostilities to the Chinchow (Qinzhou) area, that is, along the southern border of Manchuria. Japan, as well as China, did agree to the establishment of a League commission of inquiry in December, each believing that its findings would be favorable to its own side.","['the 1920s', 'December']",initial reaction secretary state stimson share official washington unilateral act kwantung army check tokyo ’s civilian leader cooperative 1920s stimson believe want sanction action undermine framework washington conference treaty american overestimate japanese government ’s ability willingness rein military civilian leader tokyo badly shake london naval treaty episode public opinion express deep satisfaction military action “ punish china ” opposition party attack cabinet allegedly “ weak kneed ” diplomacy little inclination heed stimson ’s wish japan seek prevent league nation meet discuss mukden incident prefer settle affair bilaterally china league meet call nation agree immediate cease fire kwantung army respond extend hostility chinchow qinzhou area southern border manchuria japan china agree establishment league commission inquiry december believe finding favorable,118,[1920],1920,1,1925,1950
858,"An American, General Frank R. McCoy, was appointed to serve on the commission, which was headed by Lord Lytton. This showed a deep U.S. involvement in the international efforts to contain the crisis. Stimson had earlier sent an American consul at Geneva, Prentiss B. Gilbert, to participate in League discussions on the Manchurian crisis, indicating a rare willingness to work closely with the world organization. And when, in early January 1932, the Japanese army completed the conquest of southern Manchuria, Secretary Stimson issued a statement declaring that the United States would not recognize any agreement China and Japan might enter into that violated the principles of China’s territorial and administrative integrity or of the Open Door. These instances indicate that the Hoover administration was desperately trying to preserve the structure of international affairs that had been established after the war. If it took joining the League’s efforts, America would do so. Implemented at a time when President Hoover was acting in similar fashion regarding world financial issues, American policy during the Manchurian crisis gave strong evidence of a determination to retain a framework of international cooperation.7",['early January 1932'],general frank r. mccoy appoint serve commission head lord lytton show deep u.s involvement international effort contain crisis stimson early send consul geneva prentiss b. gilbert participate league discussion manchurian crisis indicate rare willingness work closely world organization early january 1932 japanese army complete conquest southern manchuria secretary stimson issue statement declare united state recognize agreement china japan enter violate principle china ’s territorial administrative integrity open door instance indicate hoover administration desperately try preserve structure international affair establish war take join league ’s effort america implement time president hoover act similar fashion world financial issue policy manchurian crisis give strong evidence determination retain framework international cooperation.7,107,[1932],1932,1,1950,1950

Here again, the United States was ready to be associated with a League undertaking, and President Hoover at one point even suggested that all nations might cut one-third of their respective armaments. Although nothing came of the suggestion, Britain, France, and other countries turned to the United States for support in any disarmament program; they would agree to reduce arms provided the United States promised to come to their assistance if they should be attacked (presumably by a rearmed Germany). America could not give such a pledge, but at least it would be willing to be consulted.

860,"That, however, was as far as the United States would go. When Japan defied the Lytton Commission’s report blaming it for the Manchurian crisis and urging the two Asian countries to return to the status quo of September 1931, the United States did little to prevent Japan’s withdrawal from the League, even though this was a serious blow to the world organization. Likewise, the Hoover administration was helpless when German voters in 1932 gave massive support to both the National Socialists and the Communists, two opponents of the postwar order. Thus by the time Hoover left the White House in March 1933, the international system, despite all his and his colleagues’ efforts and good intentions, had been seriously undermined. Whether it was still worth preserving would be the key question bequeathed to the next administration.","['September 1931', '1932', 'March 1933']",far united state japan defy lytton commission ’s report blame manchurian crisis urge asian country return status quo september 1931 united state little prevent japan ’s withdrawal league blow world organization likewise hoover administration helpless german voter 1932 give massive support national socialist communist opponent postwar order time hoover leave white house march 1933 international system despite colleagues’ effort good intention seriously undermine worth preserve key question bequeath administration,69,"[1931, 1932, 1933]",1932,3,1950,1950
861,"Now, however, these assumptions came under attack as the seemingly unending economic crisis gave rise to serious questioning about capitalism and liberalism. Already by 1932 an increasing number of commentators were talking of the demise of these systems and their replacement by radical alternatives from the right and the left. The American way of life, which only a few years earlier had seemed destined to transform the whole world, now began to look bankrupt. Far from being able to influence other countries in their own image, Americans began to wonder if foreign nations might not have a better solution to cope with the economic crisis. As they watched the Soviet Union successfully completing its first five-year plan (1928–32) or the increasing influence of Nazis and Communists in Germany, Americans wondered whether socialism, collectivism, and even a dictatorship might not work better than an essentially laissez-faire system of capitalist activities. Politically, the American form of governance appeared incapable of addressing the crisis, and many saw little difference between the two major parties. Some began to call for an alternative party, one that was less geared to business interests.8","['1932', 'only a few years earlier', 'five-year']",assumption come attack seemingly unending economic crisis give rise questioning capitalism liberalism 1932 increase number commentator talk demise system replacement radical alternative right left way life year earlier destine transform world begin look bankrupt far able influence country image american begin wonder foreign nation good solution cope economic crisis watch soviet union successfully complete year plan 1928–32 increase influence nazi communist germany american wonder socialism collectivism dictatorship work better essentially laissez faire system capitalist activity politically form governance appear incapable address crisis see little difference major party begin alternative party gear business interests.8,93,[1932],1932,1,1950,1950
862,"It is not surprising that in this growing critique of the liberal capitalist system, many observers explicitly rejected the kind of internationalism that had prevailed during the 1920s, seeing it as a reflection of the capitalism that had failed. It was argued that the international order that matched the domestic order of free enterprise, speculation, and acquisitive instincts had only enriched the already rich but had not brought visible benefits to the country as a whole. Wall Street bankers, speculators, and investors had been notable for their eagerness to promote economic internationalism. Now that they were being discredited, that doctrine, too, became suspect. Whereas President Hoover sought desperately to revive it, his critics wanted to have nothing to do with it, instead pushing for a radical redefinition of American foreign policy, one that minimized extensive international economic connections in favor of domestic economic pursuits. This was what Charles Beard meant by “the open door at home” in a book of that title published in 1934.9 The idea was to seek to bring about recovery through focusing attention on the home front, not by bringing back multilateralism.

863,"What about cultural internationalism? Was it also a victim of the Depression? In many respects it was, in the sense that the reaction against economic internationalism contained within it the rejection of the principles and values that had envisaged the emergence of a world community of interdependence and mutual cooperation. In an atmosphere where domestic national interests took precedence over concerns for the larger community, the kind of international consciousness that had been a notable feature of the 1920s was bound to suffer. Thus the intellectual leadership in America passed from the Frederick Taylors and Henry Fords, those who spoke the language of universally valid principles, to the Charles Beards and others emphasizing domestic needs, even to men like Charles E. Coughlin, the Detroit priest who began bitterly attacking financiers, intellectuals, and other internationally oriented people for having misled the country. Even Walter Lippmann, who had exemplified one strand of postwar internationalism, now accused the American political leaders of having promoted “the ideal of acquisitiveness” to the detriment of “those things which make a people self-respecting, serene, and confident.”10 In the context of the economic crisis, this was the language of national, not international, salvation.

864,"On the other hand, internationalism did not just disappear. Because of the very resurgence of nationalism and often narrow-minded chauvinism in many parts of the globe, there were heroic, albeit ultimately frustrating, efforts by committed cultural internationalists to keep the fire ablaze. If anything, the Paris-based International Institute of Cultural Cooperation became even more active in the early 1930s than earlier, and Germany and Japan continued to send delegates to the League’s periodic gatherings to further cultural interchanges. Perhaps most notably, the League of Nations’ committee of scientific advisers succeeded in having “moral disarmament” included in the agenda of the Geneva disarmament conference. The idea was that no technical limitation on the size of armed forces would ensure peace unless it were backed up by a habit of mind that was broad-minded and cosmopolitan. It should be emphasized that, although the League proved incapable of stopping Japanese aggression in China and the assault on internationalism, its several agencies continued to carry on their work. It was as if at a time of grave international crises, the world organization had to redouble its efforts to continue to build bridges across national boundaries – and to help those who fell through the cracks as refugees. Relief, disease prevention, educational exchange, and other activities sponsored by the League as well as over four hundred international nongovernmental organizations revealed that internationalism was far from dead.","['the early 1930s', 'League']",hand internationalism disappear resurgence nationalism narrow minded chauvinism part globe heroic albeit ultimately frustrating effort committed cultural internationalist fire ablaze paris base international institute cultural cooperation active early 1930 earlier germany japan continue send delegate league ’s periodic gathering cultural interchange notably league nations’ committee scientific adviser succeed have “ moral disarmament ” include agenda geneva disarmament conference idea technical limitation size armed force ensure peace back habit mind broad minded cosmopolitan emphasize league prove incapable stop japanese aggression china assault internationalism agency continue carry work time grave international crisis world organization redouble effort continue build bridge national boundary – help fall crack refugee relief disease prevention educational exchange activity sponsor league international nongovernmental organization reveal internationalism far dead,119,[1930],1930,1,1950,1950
865,"In the United States, too, organizations like the Foreign Policy Association and the Council on Foreign Relations never let up their activities during the Depression. Although handicapped by the fact that corporate and individual donations significantly diminished, these associations continued to recruit new members and sought to combat the rising tide of antiinternationalism. It is interesting to note that during the 1930s the Carnegie Corporation devoted some of its resources to foreign language study in the United States as well as educational exchanges with other countries.11 It joined the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation (founded in Michigan in 1936), and other nongovernmental organizations in seeking to keep alive, and enhance wherever possible, the movement for intellectual communication and transnational understanding at a time when governments appeared to be abandoning such tasks and wrangling with one another in pursuit of their parochial concerns. A notable example of such nonstate initiatives was the activities of the Institute of Pacific Relations, whose gatherings during 1929–32 brought together Chinese and Japanese intellectuals as well as participants from America and Europe, who tried earnestly to resolve the Manchurian dispute. The fact that all these efforts proved unavailing in the short run does not detract from their historical significance, for the spirit of cultural internationalism would be kept alive during the dark years of the 1930s and reemerge as one of the potent principles for constructing another postwar world order.12","['the 1930s', '1936', 'years of the 1930s']",united state organization like foreign policy association council foreign relation let activity depression handicap fact corporate individual donation significantly diminish association continue recruit new member seek combat rise tide antiinternationalism interesting note 1930 carnegie corporation devote resource foreign language study united state educational exchange countries.11 join rockefeller foundation ford foundation found michigan 1936 nongovernmental organization seek alive enhance possible movement intellectual communication transnational understanding time government appear abandon task wrangle pursuit parochial concern notable example nonstate initiative activity institute pacific relation gathering 1929–32 bring chinese japanese intellectual participant america europe try earnestly resolve manchurian dispute fact effort prove unavail short run detract historical significance spirit cultural internationalism keep alive dark year 1930 reemerge potent principle construct postwar world order.12,119,"[1930, 1936, 1930]",1932,3,1950,1950
866,"The rise of modern totalitarianism should not, it is true, be attributed entirely to the Depression. The totalitarianism both of the right (fascism) and of the left (communism) had existed before 1929. Even if we confine our discussion to the twentieth century, it is to be noted that fascism (which may be defined as a dictatorship of the state) had developed in Italy, Germany, Hungary, and elsewhere in the wake of the Great War, where movements emerged that would challenge party politics, parliamentary democracy, and pluralistic ideologies and substitute for them a centralized system of political, economic, and social control under the state. Discontent with the results of the war, postwar inflation and unemployment, dissatisfaction with the mood of internationalism – all these played a role. Outside of Italy, however, the movement had been unable to seize power and establish its domination over national politics. After 1929, on the other hand, fascism increased its appeal because of the Depression and the climate of uncertainty in national and international affairs.","['1929', 'the twentieth century', '1929']",rise modern totalitarianism true attribute entirely depression totalitarianism right fascism left communism exist 1929 confine discussion twentieth century note fascism define dictatorship state develop italy germany hungary wake great war movement emerge challenge party politic parliamentary democracy pluralistic ideology substitute centralized system political economic social control state discontent result war postwar inflation unemployment dissatisfaction mood internationalism – play role outside italy movement unable seize power establish domination national politic 1929 hand fascism increase appeal depression climate uncertainty national international affair,80,"[1929, 1929]",1929,2,1950,1950
867,"Communism, in the meantime, had emerged in Russia out of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. It had always insisted on a dictatorship of the proletariat in which the Communist party would wield ultimate power as the embodiment of proletarian interests. Eventually, the state was supposed to “wither away,” and when all countries reached that stage – that is, after they had gone through a proletarian revolution – there would be no separate state entities but only one world. But in the late 1920s, when Joseph Stalin established himself as the undisputed leader, he reoriented the revolutionary agenda so that the preservation and expansion of the interests of the Soviet Union took primacy over considerations of the worldwide solidarity of the proletariat. The Communist party remained the key source of power, but the state, whose leaders were all members of the party, developed its own system of power – above all, police and intelligence agencies – and established virtually total control over individual citizens. Although this tendency had emerged before 1929, and although the Depression did not affect the Soviet economy as severely as the capitalist ones, it was nevertheless confirmed in the late 1920s and the early 1930s when the Soviet Union launched its first five-year plan. Here the stress was on self-sufficiency and the development of heavy industry. With American and European capital drying up, it was inevitable that funds and human resources for industrialization had to be sought at home, a process that confirmed the policy of collectivization – and the further growth of state power.","['1917', '–', '–', 'the late 1920s', '–', '1929', 'the late 1920s', 'the early 1930s', 'five-year']",communism meantime emerge russia bolshevik revolution 1917 insist dictatorship proletariat communist party wield ultimate power embodiment proletarian interest eventually state suppose “ wither away ” country reach stage – go proletarian revolution – separate state entity world late 1920 joseph stalin establish undisputed leader reorient revolutionary agenda preservation expansion interest soviet union take primacy consideration worldwide solidarity proletariat communist party remain key source power state leader member party develop system power – police intelligence agency – establish virtually total control individual citizen tendency emerge 1929 depression affect soviet economy severely capitalist one confirm late 1920 early 1930 soviet union launch year plan stress self sufficiency development heavy industry european capital dry inevitable fund human resource industrialization seek home process confirm policy collectivization – growth state power,126,"[1917, 1920, 1929, 1920, 1930]",1923,5,1925,1950

The differences between the totalitarianism of right and left were less significant than the fact that they both assaulted democracy and liberalism, the prevailing orientations of postwar national and international affairs. And in the early 1930s more and more countries were abandoning, or at least weakening their commitment to, democratic politics, liberal economics, and free cultural expression. In Europe, the citizens of Austria, Romania, Finland, and others saw the erosion of democratic government; in Asia, Japanese political parties became steadily weaker, powerless to stem the growing power of the military to control decisions, while in China the Nationalists turned to Germany and Italy for inspiration even as they fought against the Communist insurgents; and in Latin America fascination with totalitarianism was spreading, typically embodied in Juan Peron’s fascist movement in Argentina.",['the early 1930s'],fascism communism differ origin share common feature undisputed power state rejection democracy pluralism particularistic nationalism difference totalitarianism right leave significant fact assault democracy liberalism prevail orientation postwar national international affair early 1930 country abandon weaken commitment democratic politic liberal economic free cultural expression europe citizen austria romania finland see erosion democratic government asia japanese political party steadily weak powerless stem grow power military control decision china nationalist turn germany italy inspiration fight communist insurgent latin america fascination totalitarianism spread typically embody juan peron ’s fascist movement argentina,87,[1930],1930,1,1950,1950

870,"War, Ernst Röhm, commander of the SA (storm troopers), asserted, “is an internal necessity for a people which desires to remain on this earth and to conquer. For the soldier war is the foundation of youth, hope, and fulfillment.”3 Such an expression, which was repeated regularly in the fascist states, was a clear rejection of the prevailing peace sentiments of the 1920s. Instead of looking upon peace as a normal and normative state of affairs, now war came to symbolize what was good and noble in human societies, at least in fascist communities. In such communities the state was to be the embodiment of the will to war, of the self-sacrifice and willingness to die for the collective good. Peace, on the other hand, suggested a passivity, a mundane existence, doldrums that gave no meaning to the collectivities. “In all other countries,” an American observer noted in 1934, “future wars are regarded, except by small groups personally interested in war and war profits, as a possible evil for which one must be fully prepared. In Nationalist Socialist Germany, war is the national ideal and the end of all political and social aspirations…. It … is the end of statecraft itself.”4 He might have added Italy and Japan to the list. For those and other countries that were joining the ranks of fascist states, war was taken as a perpetual condition of national and international affairs. The Communist leaders in the Soviet Union may not necessarily have shared such a view of war, but they too perceived the world as an arena for struggle for power, where war was a constant possibility threatening the domestic regime. As Alan Milward has pointed out, none of these countries was at this time making plans for a long, drawn-out war.5 But at least the fascist states of Europe considered the use of force as a plausible national policy not only for specific ends but also for the effect it had on national discipline and glory.","['the 1920s', '1934']",war ernst röhm commander sa storm trooper assert internal necessity people desire remain earth conquer soldier war foundation youth hope fulfillment.”3 expression repeat regularly fascist state clear rejection prevail peace sentiment 1920s instead look peace normal normative state affair war come symbolize good noble human society fascist community community state embodiment war self sacrifice willingness die collective good peace hand suggest passivity mundane existence doldrum give meaning collectivitie “ country ” observer note 1934 “ future war regard small group personally interested war war profit possible evil fully prepare nationalist socialist germany war national ideal end political social aspiration … … end statecraft itself.”4 add italy japan list country join rank fascist state war take perpetual condition national international affair communist leader soviet union necessarily share view war perceive world arena struggle power war constant possibility threaten domestic regime alan milward point country time make plan long draw war.5 fascist state europe consider use force plausible national policy specific end effect national discipline glory,164,"[1920, 1934]",1927,2,1950,1950
871,"This was not just a return to the Hobbesian conception in which sovereign states were in a constant state of war or war preparedness. In the 1930s, the totalitarian countries were making a far more explicit connection between domestic order and foreign affairs than had ever been made before the Great War. For the fascist nations, and for the Soviet Union under Stalin’s dictatorship, war was inseparable from the very being of the state; memories of wars connected the present to the past, and the thought of war to come established the legitimacy of the domestic order. Totalitarianism, then, was a system of political control that gave priority to internal unity, discipline, and self-sacrifice in the name of national power and glory. Even when there was no actual war, war as a state of mind always existed; the political system was built on and further confirmed it.",['the 1930s'],return hobbesian conception sovereign state constant state war war preparedness 1930 totalitarian country make far explicit connection domestic order foreign affair great war fascist nation soviet union stalin ’s dictatorship war inseparable state memory war connect present past thought war come establish legitimacy domestic order totalitarianism system political control give priority internal unity discipline self sacrifice national power glory actual war war state mind exist political system build confirm,69,[1930],1930,1,1950,1950
872,"How were the democracies going to cope with the growing influence of totalitarianism throughout the world? In March 1933 Lippmann was writing that “the peoples that knew democracy in the nineteenth century, the peoples that have lived under the heritage of liberalism, have not fallen into disorder and have not surrendered to dictators.”6 He had in mind the democracies of Scandinavia, Switzerland, France, Britain and the Dominions, and the United States. These appeared to be the only democracies left, and Lippmann confidently asserted that they had been “able to fortify democracy” despite the spread of totalitarianism because in those countries “popular government was inherently strong.” He would soon become less confident of this and would indeed attack the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt as taking the country down the path of fascism. And in other democracies, too, there were forces (such as the union movement in Britain) that were growing impatient with the slow pace of democratic government in the face of a severe economic crisis. Voices were everywhere calling for some type of authoritarian control at least until the crisis passed. They asserted that traditional democratic politics, characterized by squabbling among party politicians beholden to interest groups, was not capable of dealing with the issues of massive unemployment, mortgage foreclosures, and widespread hunger, nor could ordinary business mechanisms be trusted to alleviate the crisis. What was needed, it was argued, was a new system wherein a central regime would act forcefully to create jobs, redistribute income, and otherwise satisfy the minimum needs of the people.","['March 1933', 'the nineteenth century']",democracy go cope grow influence totalitarianism world march 1933 lippmann write “ people know democracy nineteenth century people live heritage liberalism fall disorder surrender dictators.”6 mind democracy scandinavia switzerland france britain dominion united state appear democracy leave lippmann confidently assert “ able fortify democracy ” despite spread totalitarianism country “ popular government inherently strong ” soon confident attack presidency franklin d. roosevelt take country path fascism democracy force union movement britain grow impatient slow pace democratic government face severe economic crisis voice call type authoritarian control crisis pass assert traditional democratic politic characterize squabble party politician beholden interest group capable deal issue massive unemployment mortgage foreclosure widespread hunger ordinary business mechanism trust alleviate crisis need argue new system central regime act forcefully create job redistribute income satisfy minimum need people,130,[1933],1933,1,1950,1950
873,"During the first half of the 1930s the democracies were thus confronted with an unprecedented challenge to their legitimacy. They were being called upon to meet the challenge without transforming themselves into something alien to the democratic tradition. This was the task Franklin D. Roosevelt, along with the leaders of other democracies, sought to perform as he entered the White House in March 1933. His New Deal programs need not be described in detail here, as we are more concerned with U.S. foreign affairs. But no discussion of international relations in the early 1930s will be adequate without some mention of the momentous experiment being undertaken in the United States, for many contemporary observers agreed that if democratic government disappeared in the world’s biggest democracy, it would have grave implications for the other democracies, and as a consequence international affairs would significantly alter their character, given the proclivities of fascist states for war.","['the first half of the 1930s', 'March 1933', 'the early 1930s']",half 1930 democracy confront unprecedented challenge legitimacy call meet challenge transform alien democratic tradition task franklin d. roosevelt leader democracy seek perform enter white house march 1933 new deal program ne describe detail concerned u.s foreign affair discussion international relation early 1930 adequate mention momentous experiment undertake united state contemporary observer agree democratic government disappear world ’s big democracy grave implication democracy consequence international affair significantly alter character give proclivity fascist state war,73,"[1930, 1933, 1930]",1931,3,1950,1950
874,"Because such an arrangement fortified national unity, and because there was now a greater degree of collaboration between state and society (as represented by business, labor, and the professions), American politics during the New Deal fell somewhere between the traditional liberal state and the fascist state. But the New Deal struck many contemporary observers as a program carrying the nation farther and farther away from liberalism and moving it toward fascism. Benito Mussolini, for one, congratulated Franklin D. Roosevelt for emulating Italy’s fascism in transforming American government.7 Walter Lippmann, too, came to characterize the New Deal as totalitarian. It cannot be denied that the United States was now becoming more centralized and bureaucratized and that in that process traditional conceptions of democracy, liberalism, and free enterprise were being significantly redefined. Writing in 1934, a contributor to Harper’s magazine noted, “To attempt a defence of democracy these days is a little like defending paganism in 313 or the divine right of kings in 1793. It is taken for granted that democracy is bad and that it is dying…. One notices a certain shame among liberals and democrats of today, as if they dared not avow their beliefs. They are like pariahs, satisfied to be allowed to vegetate.”8 Nevertheless, the same author asserted, correctly, that so long as there remained freedom – the freedom of expression, assembly, politics – the nation would not go the way of Germany, Italy, or the Soviet Union. And indeed, in the United States the growth of federal planning and bureaucracy did not result in the suppression of freedoms. If anything, it might even be argued that more people than ever were now given an opportunity to express themselves; they were being incorporated into the political system, not through totalitarian manipulation from above nor through massive indoctrination to glorify the state but through economic and social measures that gave the population a stake in the New Deal and enabled Americans to be active participants in the political process. (It is pertinent to note, in this connection, that various ethnic groups and minorities, in particular African Americans, became involved in national politics for the first time in the nation’s history. Although the African Americans remained far from being accepted as equal members of society, the New Deal reformers were aware of the need to reach out to them. Eleanor Roosevelt, in particular, emerged as a champion of civil rights.)9","['1934', 'these days', '1793', 'today', '–']",arrangement fortify national unity great degree collaboration state society represent business labor profession politic new deal fall traditional liberal state fascist state new deal strike contemporary observer program carry nation farther farther away liberalism move fascism benito mussolini congratulate franklin d. roosevelt emulate italy ’s fascism transform government.7 walter lippmann come characterize new deal totalitarian deny united state centralized bureaucratized process traditional conception democracy liberalism free enterprise significantly redefine write 1934 contributor harper ’s magazine note “ attempt defence democracy day little like defend paganism 313 divine right king 1793 take grant democracy bad die … notice certain shame liberal democrat today dare avow belief like pariah satisfied allow vegetate.”8 author assert correctly long remain freedom – freedom expression assembly politic – nation way germany italy soviet union united state growth federal planning bureaucracy result suppression freedom argue people give opportunity express incorporate political system totalitarian manipulation massive indoctrination glorify state economic social measure give population stake new deal enable american active participant political process pertinent note connection ethnic group minority particular african american involved national politic time nation ’s history african american remain far accept equal member society new deal reformer aware need reach eleanor roosevelt particular emerge champion civil rights.)9,202,"[1934, 1793]",1864,2,1875,1900
875,"It may well be that Mussolini was at least partially right in his assertion that Roosevelt was emulating him, in that the United States was developing a corporatist system – an arrangement for the collaboration of state and society, in particular the government, business, and labor. But, as noted in a previous chapter, such an arrangement had emerged in the 1920s, if not earlier, and has been known by the term “corporatism.” Whether the New Deal can be characterized as a corporatist arrangement may, however, be questioned. At its inception, in any event, there was a great deal of government supervision of the economy rather than the kind of voluntary cooperation between government and business that had existed in the 1920s. Indeed, in sharp contrast to the business civilization of the preceding decade, the early 1930s saw the capitalists and industrialists being placed on the defensive, blamed for the economic disasters. The prevailing ethos of the country was strongly antibusiness, and various protest movements, such as those led by Huey Long of Louisiana and Francis E. Townsend of California, were seeking to redistribute America’s wealth through political action. Under the circumstances, the New Deal offered a less radical agenda without, however, going to the other extreme of creating a fascist-type alliance of the state and business.","['the 1920s', 'the 1920s', 'the preceding decade', 'the early 1930s']",mussolini partially right assertion roosevelt emulate united state develop corporatist system – arrangement collaboration state society particular government business labor note previous chapter arrangement emerge 1920s earlier know term “ corporatism ” new deal characterize corporatist arrangement question inception event great deal government supervision economy kind voluntary cooperation government business exist 1920s sharp contrast business civilization precede decade early 1930 see capitalist industrialist place defensive blame economic disaster prevail ethos country strongly antibusiness protest movement lead huey long louisiana francis e. townsend california seek redistribute america ’s wealth political action circumstance new deal offer radical agenda go extreme create fascist type alliance state business,104,"[1920, 1920, 1930]",1923,3,1925,1950
876,"That was the background against which the phenomenon known as isolationism became a major force in America in the mid-1930s. Isolationism of the decade in essence meant the nation was not going to depart from its basic orientation to peace and instead was going to avoid any involvement in external complications. Because external complications were inevitable, given the totalitarian regimes’ proclivities toward war and an activist foreign policy, the continued adherence to pacifism and abhorrence of war suggested that the United States would become more isolated, and therefore less relevant, in world affairs than it had been during the first decade after the war.","['the mid-1930s', 'the decade', 'the first decade']",background phenomenon know isolationism major force america mid-1930 isolationism decade essence mean nation go depart basic orientation peace instead go avoid involvement external complication external complication inevitable give totalitarian regimes' proclivity war activist foreign policy continued adherence pacifism abhorrence war suggest united state isolated relevant world affair decade war,49,[1930],1930,1,1950,1950
877,"The isolationist sentiment was abetted by the failure of the Hoover administration to contribute to restoring some order in international affairs after the world had been shaken by the unilateral action of Japan and by the independent economic measures undertaken by various European nations. Because the American efforts to support the League of Nations in stopping Japanese aggression and to promote worldwide disarmament and economic cooperation had not succeeded, public opinion, as well as official thinking, after 1933 came to be much less willing to endorse repetition of these attempts. Both were convinced that the first priorities of the new administration should be to restore confidence in the domestic economy and to do something about the Depression to stem the tide; as a result, foreign complications had to be avoided. The time seemed to have passed when some international cooperative action would bring about economic recovery, especially since so few countries now seemed willing to cooperate. Rather, the time had come, many argued, when the Americans must stop worrying about world events and turn their energies inward. A typical example of this isolationist sentiment was the Neutrality Act of 1935, which forbade arms shipments to all belligerents involved in a war. This completely reversed the traditional U.S. position on neutral rights, including the right to sell arms to belligerents. Now it was considered best not to insist on such rights, as had been done during 1914–17, but to restrict them so as to minimize risks of becoming involved in foreign complications.","['1933', '1935']",isolationist sentiment abet failure hoover administration contribute restore order international affair world shake unilateral action japan independent economic measure undertake european nation effort support league nation stop japanese aggression promote worldwide disarmament economic cooperation succeed public opinion official thinking 1933 come willing endorse repetition attempt convince priority new administration restore confidence domestic economy depression stem tide result foreign complication avoid time pass international cooperative action bring economic recovery especially country willing cooperate time come argue american stop worry world event turn energy inward typical example isolationist sentiment neutrality act 1935 forbid arm shipment belligerent involve war completely reverse traditional u.s position neutral right include right sell arm belligerent consider best insist right 1914–17 restrict minimize risk involve foreign complication,119,"[1933, 1935]",1934,2,1950,1950
878,"Some specific examples can illustrate the point. Concerning the chaotic state of international economic transactions, Roosevelt, unlike Hoover, was little inclined to play an assertive role at the London economic conference, which had been prepared while Hoover was still president but was not convened until June 1933. The conference was an opportunity – as it turned out, the last opportunity – for the world’s industrial nations to see if they could coordinate their foreign economic policies on such thorny issues as debts and reparations, protectionism, and managed currencies. And the outcome depended to a great extent on the United States; for, despite the Depression, it was still seen as the linchpin of the global economic order.","['June 1933', 'an opportunity –']",specific example illustrate point concern chaotic state international economic transaction roosevelt unlike hoover little inclined play assertive role london economic conference prepare hoover president convene june 1933 conference opportunity – turn opportunity – world ’s industrial nation coordinate foreign economic policy thorny issue debt reparation protectionism manage currency outcome depend great extent united state despite depression see linchpin global economic order,61,[1933],1933,1,1950,1950
879,"The same general attitude was evident in America’s responses to other international crises at that time. Perhaps the most obvious – and unfortunate – example of this was the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, a product of pressures by lawmakers representing silver and farming interests. The act in effect nationalized silver; President Roosevelt ordered the Treasury Department to purchase all silver in the United States at fifty cents an ounce, which was considerably higher than current prices. The intent was to remonetize silver and increase its circulation, particularly in the western states. But the policy had the effect of attracting silver in other parts of the world to the United States. China, a silver-monetized economy, was particularly hard hit as quantities of silver were drained out of the country, attracted by higher prices in the United States. The Japanese army occupying Manchuria and parts of northern China was not above manipulating the operation to create further confusion in the Chinese economy. The severe impact of American silver purchases on China was not an intended result of Roosevelt’s policy, but the episode was characteristic of Washington’s foreign affairs at that time.",['1934'],general attitude evident america ’s response international crisis time obvious – unfortunate – example silver purchase act 1934 product pressure lawmaker represent silver farming interest act effect nationalize silver president roosevelt order treasury department purchase silver united state cent ounce considerably high current price intent remonetize silver increase circulation particularly western state policy effect attract silver part world united state china silver monetize economy particularly hard hit quantity silver drain country attract high price united state japanese army occupy manchuria part northern china manipulate operation create confusion chinese economy severe impact silver purchase china intended result roosevelt ’s policy episode characteristic washington ’s foreign affair time,106,[1934],1934,1,1950,1950
880,"It should be noted, however, that U.S. economic and financial transactions with other countries did not disappear altogether even in the depth of the Depression. Foreign trade continued, although on a much reduced scale. In 1935, for instance, the nation exported $2,283 million of goods overseas and imported $2,047 million in return. These figures show a drastic reduction in the value of trade since the 1920s and also suggest that the surplus of exports over imports was diminishing. Foreign investments, too, did not totally diminish. The United States attracted foreign capital (over $11 billion [American billion] in 1938), while at the same time Americans continued to lend and invest abroad ($7 billion [American billion] in the same year).11 But the domestic political and ideological atmosphere was such that there was much criticism of such activities, “international bankers” along with “rich” American financiers being targeted for attack as sources of complications and conflict abroad. It is a remarkable thing that, in the middle of such an atmosphere, Secretary of State Hull and some of his State Department colleagues should nevertheless have sought to revive a reintegrated world economic order by starting discussions with their British counterparts for a new trade agreement, to persuade them to eliminate the barriers established under the system of imperial preferences. Little in the way of concrete results came of such efforts at this time, but they were patiently paving the way for what would emerge as the new global economic order after the Second World War.","['1935', 'the 1920s', '1938']","note u.s economic financial transaction country disappear altogether depth depression foreign trade continue reduce scale 1935 instance nation export 2,283 million good overseas import 2,047 million return figure drastic reduction value trade 1920 suggest surplus export import diminish foreign investment totally diminish united state attract foreign capital 11 billion billion 1938 time american continue lend invest abroad 7 billion billion year).11 domestic political ideological atmosphere criticism activity “ international banker ” “ rich ” financier target attack source complication conflict abroad remarkable thing middle atmosphere secretary state hull state department colleague seek revive reintegrate world economic order start discussion british counterpart new trade agreement persuade eliminate barrier establish system imperial preference little way concrete result come effort time patiently pave way emerge new global economic order second world war",129,"[1935, 1920, 1938]",1931,3,1950,1950
881,"American foreign policy during the first Roosevelt administration, in any event, was no longer being put in the framework of collective security, as it had been under the Hoover-Stimson policy. The United States would now abandon efforts at a comprehensive solution of the Sino-Japanese conflict and deal with the situation in a pragmatic fashion as events unfolded. It was not that the United States would recognize the fruits of Japanese aggression. There was no question of extending recognition to the puppet state of Manchukuo, which the Japanese had proclaimed in occupied Manchuria in 1932, or altering the professed policies of the Open Door or the territorial integrity of China. When the Japanese Foreign Ministry announced, in 1934, that the nation would look with disfavor upon third countries’ separate dealings with China, Washington immediately protested against such an infringement upon these principles. The United States likewise refused to consider Japan’s offer of a new Pacific condominium, each side defining its own spheres of influence in the region and both pledging to abide by the new status quo. The Roosevelt administration would not reward Japanese expansion, but neither would it undertake any significant step to push it back. The passing, in 1934, of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, promising independence to the Philippines in twelve years, fitted into the overall picture. The United States was ready to withdraw from the western Pacific as a colonial power. But this was more in response to domestic pressures – various interest groups feared the rising competition of Filipino goods unless the Philippines became severed from the United States – than a product of strategic rethinking about that part of the world.","['1932', '1934', '1934', 'twelve years']",foreign policy roosevelt administration event longer framework collective security hoover stimson policy united state abandon effort comprehensive solution sino japanese conflict deal situation pragmatic fashion event unfold united state recognize fruit japanese aggression question extend recognition puppet state manchukuo japanese proclaim occupy manchuria 1932 alter profess policy open door territorial integrity china japanese foreign ministry announce 1934 nation look disfavor countries' separate dealing china washington immediately protest infringement principle united state likewise refuse consider japan ’s offer new pacific condominium define sphere influence region pledge abide new status quo roosevelt administration reward japanese expansion undertake significant step push passing 1934 tyding mcduffie act promising independence philippine year fit overall picture united state ready withdraw western pacific colonial power response domestic pressure – interest group fear rise competition filipino good philippine sever united state – product strategic rethink world,138,"[1932, 1934, 1934]",1933,3,1950,1950
882,"The drift and indecisiveness in America’s Asian policy were also evident in the failure to renew naval disarmament agreements with Japan and Britain. The Washington and London naval agreements were both to expire in 1936 unless renewed, and preliminary discussions were held by representatives of the three navies throughout 1934 and 1935, but they came to nothing as Japan insisted on parity in all categories of ships, something the United States and Britain refused to accept. For the Japanese the principle of parity would recognize the new status quo in the Pacific, whereas for the Americans parity would only lead to an arms race; they instead called for a 20 percent across-the-board reduction in all categories of ships, a proposal neither Japan nor Britain accepted. There was no agreement, and the Japanese took the lapse of the disarmament agreements seriously, immediately beginning to work on a new naval strategy aimed ultimately at controlling the southwestern Pacific. No such reorientation took place in the United States, where naval construction tended to be viewed more in connection with creating jobs for the unemployed than in the framework of power rivalry across the Pacific.","['1936', '1934', '1935']",drift indecisiveness america ’s asian policy evident failure renew naval disarmament agreement japan britain washington london naval agreement expire 1936 renew preliminary discussion hold representative navy 1934 1935 come japan insist parity category ship united state britain refuse accept japanese principle parity recognize new status quo pacific american parity lead arm race instead call 20 percent board reduction category ship proposal japan britain accept agreement japanese take lapse disarmament agreement seriously immediately begin work new naval strategy aim ultimately control southwestern pacific reorientation take place united state naval construction tend view connection create job unemployed framework power rivalry pacific,99,"[1936, 1934, 1935]",1935,3,1950,1950
883,"Similarly, in Europe, U.S. policy lacked precise definition other than that of trying to keep out of trouble spots. When Italian troops invaded Ethiopia in 1934, the first overt challenge hurled at international order since the Japanese conquest of Manchuria, Roosevelt explicitly condemned Italy as the aggressor but mitigated its impact by invoking neutrality. American citizens were prohibited not only from selling arms to the belligerents but also from traveling in their vessels. Of course, because Ethiopia would not have the cash or ships to tempt Americans, the effect of neutrality was to penalize Italy. Still, this policy was intended more to avoid becoming involved in foreign complications, as happened during the Great War, than to try to change the outcome of the conflict. When the League of Nations voted to impose economic sanctions on Italy – significantly, oil was exempted from sanctions – the president called on the American people to abide by the resolution. The result was a moral embargo, without the force of law, and American shipments of oil and other goods to Italy did not significantly abate.12","['1934', '–']",similarly europe u.s policy lack precise definition try trouble spot italian troop invade ethiopia 1934 overt challenge hurl international order japanese conquest manchuria roosevelt explicitly condemn italy aggressor mitigate impact invoke neutrality citizen prohibit sell arm belligerent travel vessel course ethiopia cash ship tempt american effect neutrality penalize italy policy intend avoid involve foreign complication happen great war try change outcome conflict league nation vote impose economic sanction italy – significantly oil exempt sanction – president call people abide resolution result moral embargo force law shipment oil good italy significantly abate.12,91,[1934],1934,1,1950,1950
884,"Indeed, compared with those of Japan and Italy, Germany’s immediate goals were modest: to get rid of the restrictions imposed upon it by the peace treaty of 1919. Rearmament was the major issue, with Hitler intent on eliminating the restrictions on the size of Germany’s armed forces and on their stationing in the Rhineland. Thus in 1933 he denounced the Geneva disarmament conference and withdrew Germany from the League of Nations; two years later he entered into a naval agreement with the British in which German naval power would be limited to 35 percent of Britain’s (still a considerable increase over what had been granted Germany in 1919); and in 1936 German troops marched into the Rhineland to reoccupy the hitherto demilitarized area.","['1919', '1933', 'two years later', '1919', '1936']",compare japan italy germany ’s immediate goal modest rid restriction impose peace treaty 1919 rearmament major issue hitler intent eliminate restriction size germany ’s armed force stationing rhineland 1933 denounce geneva disarmament conference withdraw germany league nation year later enter naval agreement british german naval power limit 35 percent britain ’s considerable increase grant germany 1919 1936 german troop march rhineland reoccupy hitherto demilitarized area,65,"[1919, 1933, 1919, 1936]",1927,4,1950,1950
885,"Of the two, the first, recognition of the Soviet Union, did not yield immediate results but was pregnant with important implications for international relations. The decision to recognize the socialist nation was not a product of mature deliberation on world affairs in which the implications of the rising power and unilateralism of Japan and Germany were fully discussed. Rather, Roosevelt responded to Soviet overtures for normalizing relations – and as far as the Russians were concerned, there was little doubt that they were becoming worried about the developments in Europe and Asia – as a modest diplomatic achievement and, moreover, something that would please farmers, industrialists, and traders who were keen on expanding the Soviet markets. Formal recognition came in November 1933, but that was not followed up by any significant measure that would bring the U.S.-Soviet connection into the equation of world politics. William C. Bullitt, whose interest in reaching out to the Soviets went back to the Paris peace conference days, was named first ambassador to Moscow, but he soon became disillusioned about establishing close ties with the Soviet Union.","['November 1933', 'days']",recognition soviet union yield immediate result pregnant important implication international relation decision recognize socialist nation product mature deliberation world affair implication rise power unilateralism japan germany fully discuss roosevelt respond soviet overture normalize relation – far russian concern little doubt worried development europe asia – modest diplomatic achievement farmer industrialist trader keen expand soviet market formal recognition come november 1933 follow significant measure bring u.s .- soviet connection equation world politic william c. bullitt interest reach soviet go paris peace conference day name ambassador moscow soon disillusioned establish close tie soviet union,92,[1933],1933,1,1950,1950

If the United States had been even minimally interested in influencing international relations, it might have taken more interest in the Soviet initiative, but instead it viewed the affair as another instance of Comintern propaganda.

887,"Initiated with greater fanfare was the Roosevelt administration’s Latin American policy, which came to be known as the Good Neighbor policy. As noted earlier, the decision to reverse U.S. interventionism – of the type exemplified by Theodore Roosevelt’s Corollary and by the occupation of Haiti and Santo Domingo during the Wilson presidency – had been made by President Hoover. What the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration did was to expand the scope and to espouse openly the policy of nonintervention. When Secretary of State Hull went to Montevideo, Uruguay, in December 1933 to attend the seventh international conference of American states – such conferences had been held since before the war – he supported the declaration to the effect that “no state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.”16 As if to put the principle into practice, Washington proceeded to abrogate the Platt Amendment with respect to Cuba (1901), through which the United States had retained the right of intervention in that country.

888,"These steps fitted in with the overall direction of American foreign policy, away from activism toward isolationism and passivity. For the first time since the turn of the century, the United States would not take upon itself the task of ensuring political or economic stability in the Caribbean. It would not again intervene in the domestic affairs of another American state. In retrospect, of course, it is clear that this aspect of the Good Neighbor policy lasted for only a short while. Within less than ten years, American military power would once again involve itself in Latin America, albeit under different circumstances. It should be noted, however, that the Good Neighbor policy also formed part of an emerging approach to the Western Hemisphere in the framework of regionalism, that is, as part of the worldwide trend toward regional, as opposed to global, arrangements. Although not quite the same thing as the British Commonwealth’s imperial preference system or Japan’s Asian autarky, the Good Neighbor policy sought to bind the American republics together politically and economically. Thus the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, authorizing the president to negotiate with foreign governments for raising or lowering tariffs, resulted in a series of trade agreements with Latin American countries. Although there was no immediate expansion of hemispheric trade, these negotiations did serve to cement the emerging regional ties, enabling the American nations to withstand the tensions caused by developments elsewhere. In a sense, then, the Good Neighbor policy was designed to isolate the Western Hemisphere from Asia and Europe. In that way, too, it was an aspect of American isolationism. It reflected the determination that, in a world being buffeted by increased armaments and their aggressive use on the part of some nations, the United States would remain underarmed and eschew military engagement abroad. Without a decision to increase arms, and without a willingness to undertake an ideological offensive of the kind the Comintern was pursuing, isolationism seemed the only feasible alternative.","['the turn of the century', 'less than ten years', '1934']",step fit overall direction foreign policy away activism isolationism passivity time turn century united state task ensure political economic stability caribbean intervene domestic affair state retrospect course clear aspect good neighbor policy last short year military power involve latin america albeit different circumstance note good neighbor policy form emerge approach western hemisphere framework regionalism worldwide trend regional oppose global arrangement thing british commonwealth ’s imperial preference system japan ’s asian autarky good neighbor policy seek bind republic politically economically reciprocal trade agreement act 1934 authorize president negotiate foreign government raise lower tariff result series trade agreement latin country immediate expansion hemispheric trade negotiation serve cement emerge regional tie enable nation withstand tension cause development sense good neighbor policy design isolate western hemisphere asia europe way aspect isolationism reflect determination world buffet increase armament aggressive use nation united state remain underarmed eschew military engagement abroad decision increase arm willingness undertake ideological offensive kind comintern pursue isolationism feasible alternative,157,[1934],1934,1,1950,1950

Almost immediately, Germany and Italy began assisting the insurgents, while the Soviet Union took sides with the Republic. Britain and France desperately sought to prevent the civil war from turning into an international war and succeeded, at least on paper, in establishing an international committee of nonintervention. But the civil war continued, and during 1937–9 Franco’s forces steadily gained ground with the help of German arms, particularly aircraft as well as aviators.","['1936', 'July']",picture begin change 1936 july civil war break spain fascist lead general francisco franco challenge authority republican government madrid immediately germany italy begin assist insurgent soviet union take side republic britain france desperately seek prevent civil war turn international war succeed paper establish international committee nonintervention civil war continue 1937–9 franco ’s force steadily gain ground help german arm particularly aircraft aviator,62,[1936],1936,1,1950,1950

894,"In July 1937 China and Japan began a war that was to last eight years. Although the origins of the initial clash in Peking on the night of July 7 are still disputed, there is no question that the military conflict was a direct result of the confrontation between the newly aroused Chinese nationalism and the intention of the Japanese army to preserve and extend its sway over northern China. The latter successfully pushed Chinese forces out of the area and pursued them to central China, where the capital, Nanking (Nanjing), fell in December. The fighting in the Nanking area resulted in huge Chinese civilian casualties, said to have numbered over 300,000 according to Chinese estimates. The brutal mass slaughter was a harbinger of things to come.","['July 1937', 'last eight years', 'December']","july 1937 china japan begin war year origin initial clash peking night july 7 dispute question military conflict direct result confrontation newly arouse chinese nationalism intention japanese army preserve extend sway northern china successfully push chinese force area pursue central china capital nanking nanjing fall december fighting nanking area result huge chinese civilian casualty say number 300,000 accord chinese estimate brutal mass slaughter harbinger thing come",66,[1937],1937,1,1950,1950

But the Chinese continued their resistance, removing their capital first to Hankow and then to the remote southwestern city of Chungking (Jongjing). And so, after two years of fighting, the end was nowhere in sight. In order to improve the situation, Japan tried to set up a pro-Japanese government in Nanking, persuading Wang Ching-wei (Wang Jingwei), a prominent Nationalist, to leave Chungking for Hanoi and then for the capital (Nanking) under Japanese occupation. In the meantime, in November 1938 the Japanese government issued a declaration of the establishment of a “new order” in East Asia, asserting that the old order was forever gone and that Japan was calling upon other countries in Asia to cooperate together to define a new regional system. That system would be characterized by Asian values and principles rather than by the Western ones that had dominated the region – although no one could quite understand how the two sets of values and principles would differ.","['1938', 'two years', 'November 1938']",1938 japanese army keep push south west attempt capture control china chinese continue resistance remove capital hankow remote southwestern city chungking jongjing year fighting end sight order improve situation japan try set pro japanese government nanking persuade wang ching wei wang jingwei prominent nationalist leave chungking hanoi capital nanking japanese occupation meantime november 1938 japanese government issue declaration establishment “ new order ” east asia assert old order forever go japan call country asia cooperate define new regional system system characterize asian value principle western one dominate region – understand set value principle differ,94,"[1938, 1938]",1938,2,1950,1950
896,"The German annexation of Austria (the so-called Anschluss), which came in March 1938, was carried out with little bloodshed and without much protest on the part of other powers, basically because Austria was ethnically overwhelmingly German and its independent status had been suspect all through the postwar years. Czechoslovakia and Poland were different cases, however. These states had symbolized Europe’s postwar order, existing between Germany and Russia and tied to France through security arrangements.

897,"Yet that was precisely why Hitler wanted to act against the two new states – to deal a death blow to the system. Whether in this period he also had more far-reaching ambitions is not entirely clear. After destroying Czechoslovak and Polish sovereignty, he may have intended to continue pushing eastward to obtain the space and grains of the Ukraine; he may have visualized an ultimate race war against Slavic peoples, including those in the Soviet Union; he also may have had in mind controlling all of Europe as well as challenging the British Empire overseas. He may have entertained all such visions, but apparently he did not have a systematic war plan against any major European power prior to 1939. Rather, he would first go after Czechoslovakia and Poland and then, depending on circumstances, plan for the next step.2",['to 1939'],precisely hitler want act new state – deal death blow system period far reach ambition entirely clear destroy czechoslovak polish sovereignty intend continue push eastward obtain space grain ukraine visualize ultimate race war slavic people include soviet union mind control europe challenge british empire overseas entertain vision apparently systematic war plan major european power prior 1939 czechoslovakia poland depend circumstance plan step.2,62,[1939],1939,1,1950,1950
898,"The initial step turned out to be a diplomatic one. The British and the French governments were willing to negotiate with Hitler so as to avoid a premature war. Their policy was called “appeasement” and was derived from the idea that while those nations built up arms, it would be prudent to try negotiation. Some compromise settlement, even if it might mean a further erosion of the Versailles arrangements, would be preferable to a destructive war for which the democracies were not prepared. One prominent example of the appeasement policy was the Munich agreement of September 1938, by which Sudetenland was annexed to Germany with the blessing of Britain and France. When this was followed in March 1939 by Hitler’s annexation of most of the rest of Czechoslovakia, however, British and French reaction was swift. They immediately declared that they would no longer acquiesce in acts of German aggression and that if Hitler should move against Polish independence they would honor their commitment to the latter, implying that they would even use force to stop Germany.3","['September 1938', 'March 1939']",initial step turn diplomatic british french government willing negotiate hitler avoid premature war policy call “ appeasement ” derive idea nation build arm prudent try negotiation compromise settlement mean erosion versaille arrangement preferable destructive war democracy prepare prominent example appeasement policy munich agreement september 1938 sudetenland annex germany blessing britain france follow march 1939 hitler ’s annexation rest czechoslovakia british french reaction swift immediately declare longer acquiesce act german aggression hitler polish independence honor commitment imply use force stop germany.3,80,"[1938, 1939]",1938,2,1950,1950
899,"By the spring of 1939, then, the lines dividing Germany from Britain and France were being drawn more sharply than heretofore, and the appeasement strategy was being abandoned by London and Paris. At the same time, the British and French governments approached the Soviet Union for possible agreement on strategic cooperation against Germany. The picture became complicated, however, when Moscow and Berlin also began negotiations looking toward some sort of deal that would prevent war between the two. For both nations such a deal made sense; Germany would not have to worry about a two-front war, and the Soviet Union would also be able to avoid a premature conflict with Germany at a time when it was concerned with the Japanese menace in the East. (Soviet and Japanese troops clashed in Nomonhan, along the Siberian-Mongolian-Manchurian border, throughout the summer.) The upshot was a German-Soviet nonaggression pact on August 23, 1939. The pact not only undermined the antifascist global popular front the Comintern had been seeking to erect, but it also brought two major totalitarian states together, at least for the time being.","['the spring of 1939', 'August 23, 1939']",spring 1939 line divide germany britain france draw sharply heretofore appeasement strategy abandon london paris time british french government approach soviet union possible agreement strategic cooperation germany picture complicated moscow berlin begin negotiation look sort deal prevent war nation deal sense germany worry war soviet union able avoid premature conflict germany time concern japanese menace east soviet japanese troop clash nomonhan siberian mongolian manchurian border summer upshot german soviet nonaggression pact august 23 1939 pact undermine antifascist global popular comintern seek erect bring major totalitarian state time,87,"[1939, 1939]",1939,2,1950,1950

Steadily after 1937, however, the Roosevelt administration began showing signs of a willingness to reenter the international arena.

This was in a sense the application of the Montevideo policy of nonintervention to Spain, but it was tame even in comparison with the European powers’ nonintervention committee (not joined by the United States).","['1936', 'that year']",significant lag challenge response 1936 isolationist thrust foreign policy change reconfirm neutrality act year extend mandatory neutrality extension loan credit belligerent spanish civil war break state department institute moral embargo exhort american ship arm sense application montevideo policy nonintervention spain tame comparison european powers’ nonintervention committee join united state,49,[1936],1936,1,1950,1950
903,"The Buenos Aires conference also adopted a program for an exchange of graduate students and teachers on government fellowships between the United States and other American nations, the first such program officially sponsored by Washington.4 This was an important indication that cultural cooperation was being taken seriously as an official concern of the United States. It is interesting to note that during the 1930s several governments actively promoted cultural exchange and propaganda activities. Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, and others established governmental or semiofficial agencies to carry out such work, attesting to the importance they attached to influencing other countries through exchange and informational programs with a view to creating pockets of favorable foreign opinion. In the U.S. cultural exchange had been carried out by private foundations and educational institutions, but now Washington officially adopted the view that foreign policy entailed more than the protection of security and economic interests. Of course, culture had been a major factor in international relations during the 1920s, but at that time the stress had been on cultural internationalism, the promotion of a sense of worldwide interconnectedness and human unity. In the 1930s, in contrast, there was a particularistic tendency, cultural exchange being frankly envisaged as an instrument of official policy. This was understandable in view of the emergence of conflicting ideologies and political movements that were being put to the service of state power. World affairs, now more than ever before, had a cultural dimension, albeit in a subordinate position to power. It is therefore not surprising that the United States, too, belatedly began emphasizing foreign cultural policy, which was often referred to as “public diplomacy.”","['the 1930s', 'the 1920s', 'the 1930s']",bueno aire conference adopt program exchange graduate student teacher government fellowship united state nation program officially sponsor washington.4 important indication cultural cooperation take seriously official concern united state interesting note 1930s government actively promote cultural exchange propaganda activity britain germany italy japan establish governmental semiofficial agency carry work attest importance attach influence country exchange informational program view create pocket favorable foreign opinion u.s cultural exchange carry private foundation educational institution washington officially adopt view foreign policy entail protection security economic interest course culture major factor international relation 1920s time stress cultural internationalism promotion sense worldwide interconnectedness human unity 1930 contrast particularistic tendency cultural exchange frankly envisage instrument official policy understandable view emergence conflicting ideology political movement service state power world affair cultural dimension albeit subordinate position power surprising united state belatedly begin emphasize foreign cultural policy refer “ public diplomacy,140,"[1930, 1920, 1930]",1927,3,1950,1950
904,"In January 1937, Congress enacted another neutrality law, extending an arms embargo to any foreign country engaged in a civil war and thus forbidding the shipment of arms to either side in the Spanish civil war. (There was the fear that the moral embargo might be defied by some Americans.) At first this appeared to be the right policy, to avoid American involvement in external complications, but it soon became clear that American neutrality was actually helping Franco’s forces because they were obtaining arms from Germany, and the latter was not being prevented by neutrality legislation from purchasing weapons from the United States. This and the reported instances of the insurgents’ brutal assault on the republic in time gave rise to serious soul-searching among American isolationists. The question was whether the nation could long remain uninvolved when there were wars and civil wars abroad in which there were clear differences between aggressors and victims. Neutrality did not make a distinction between them, so it could end up further victimizing the victims by not coming to their assistance.

906,"On the other hand, it might also be noted that during Roosevelt’s first administration he was virtually immobilized in foreign affairs because of his preoccupation with domestic economic problems, whereas after winning a second term in the election of 1936, he may have felt ready to undertake some foreign policy initiatives. The country’s economic indexes (national income, production, foreign trade, etc.) had not quite recovered the levels prevailing prior to 1929, but the worst was clearly over; unemployment, farm foreclosures, and business failures had declined considerably. Although Roosevelt had several new items on his agenda – such as the “packing” of the Supreme Court so as to have more justices on the bench who were supportive of his domestic programs – he evidently believed he could now be more assertive in foreign affairs. The invitation to Chamberlain was his first attempt – and his first failure.","['1936', '1929', '–']",hand note roosevelt ’s administration virtually immobilize foreign affair preoccupation domestic economic problem win second term election 1936 feel ready undertake foreign policy initiative country ’s economic index national income production foreign trade etc recover level prevail prior 1929 bad clearly unemployment farm foreclosure business failure decline considerably roosevelt new item agenda – “ packing ” supreme court justice bench supportive domestic program – evidently believe assertive foreign affair invitation chamberlain attempt – failure,74,"[1936, 1929]",1932,2,1950,1950

Two American lives were lost, and thirty people were wounded. This was a shocking event, suggesting that even when the United States maintained neutrality in a foreign war the lives of its citizens could be jeopardized.

908,"The momentum, once developed, would not be reversed. To be sure, Roosevelt did not want to go too far ahead of public opinion, and in official pronouncements he continued to profess his determination to keep the country out of foreign complications. But there was much that he thought the nation could and should do short of direct involvement in overseas conflicts. Thus in January 1938 he resurrected Welles’s idea of an international conference, for which he proposed Washington as the site. Again Chamberlain resisted, not wishing to identify Britain too closely with the United States at a time when he was engaged in a delicate diplomacy to detach Italy from Germany (by recognizing the Italian conquest of Ethiopia). When Germany went ahead with the Anschluss, the United States took no action but announced that it would step up its rearmament program. Roosevelt was particularly eager to strengthen American naval power and fully endorsed the Vinson Naval Expansion Act of May, providing for a new program of naval rearmament, including the augmentation of capital ships to a strength of 660,000 tons – for the first time going beyond the “treaty limits” imposed by the earlier naval disarmament agreements (nullified since 1936).","['January 1938', 'May', '1936']","momentum develop reverse sure roosevelt want far ahead public opinion official pronouncement continue profess determination country foreign complication think nation short direct involvement overseas conflict january 1938 resurrect welles ’s idea international conference propose washington site chamberlain resist wish identify britain closely united state time engage delicate diplomacy detach italy germany recognize italian conquest ethiopia germany go ahead anschluss united state take action announce step rearmament program roosevelt particularly eager strengthen naval power fully endorse vinson naval expansion act provide new program naval rearmament include augmentation capital ship strength 660,000 ton – time go “ treaty limit impose early naval disarmament agreement nullify 1936",104,"[1938, 1936]",1937,2,1950,1950

A resolution against Nazi race doctrines was adopted, and the conferees also agreed to improve the existing consultative procedures to safeguard against any threat to the “peace, security, or territorial integrity” of an American state. This reaffirmation of inter-American solidarity was a major achievement, if only because U.S. relations with Mexico were at a breaking point in 1938. The accommodation between Mexican nationalism and American economic interests, which had been tentatively worked out through the efforts of Dwight Morrow and others (see Chapter 6), had once again been undermined after Lazaro Cárdenas became president in 1934. He was more radical than Calles in his economic and social programs, and in March 1938 the Cárdenas government issued an oil expropriation decree, nationalizing the properties of British and American oil companies. The United States retaliated by stopping the practice of purchasing Mexican silver above world prices and by boycotting Mexican oil, whereupon Mexico sought to sell it to Germany and Japan. Even such a serious crisis, however, did not prevent the issuing of the Lima declaration, and soon, in 1939, Mexico and the United States were able to come to agreement on fair compensation to the oil companies.9","['December', '1938', '1934', 'March 1938', '1939']",second december conference state hold lima resolution nazi race doctrine adopt conferee agree improve exist consultative procedure safeguard threat “ peace security territorial integrity ” state reaffirmation inter solidarity major achievement u.s relation mexico breaking point 1938 accommodation mexican nationalism economic interest tentatively work effort dwight morrow chapter 6 undermine lazaro cárdena president 1934 radical calle economic social program march 1938 cárdena government issue oil expropriation decree nationalize property british oil company united state retaliate stop practice purchase mexican silver world price boycott mexican oil mexico seek sell germany japan crisis prevent issuing lima declaration soon 1939 mexico united state able come agreement fair compensation oil companies.9,107,"[1938, 1934, 1938, 1939]",1937,4,1950,1950

In March 1938 a definite decision was made not to invoke the Neutrality Act in connection with the Sino-Japanese War. This enabled China to purchase arms in the United States, and already in that year some $8.9 million worth of arms was shipped to that country. The money for the transactions came from the Chinese sale of silver to the United States (about $115 million that year). Because silver had been “demonetized” in China in the wake of the silver purchase crisis of 1934, it could ship large quantities of the metal to the United States, and the proceeds from the sale could be used to obtain credits with which to purchase arms and other commodities.","['March 1938', 'that year', 'that year', '1934']",asia meantime united state assertive march 1938 definite decision invoke neutrality act connection sino japanese war enable china purchase arm united state year 8.9 million worth arm ship country money transaction come chinese sale silver united state 115 million year silver “ demonetize ” china wake silver purchase crisis 1934 ship large quantity metal united state proceed sale obtain credit purchase arm commodity,63,"[1938, 1934]",1936,2,1950,1950
912,"Of course, Japan, too, could buy arms from the United States, and it had been doing so throughout the 1930s. (In 1938 the amount came to $9.1 million.) But there was increasing public criticism of this in the United States, where the uneasy awareness grew that the nation was providing Japan with the aircraft, tanks, and ammunition with which to fight the aggressive war in China. Public rallies were held, letters were written to newspapers, and various groups were organized to protest the practice. Of the latter, the most important was the American Committee for Non-participation in Japanese Aggression, created mostly through the initiative of former American missionaries in China. The name of the organization was typical; virtually everyone agreed that Japan was engaged in an aggressive war in China, and although there was no consensus as to whether the United States should become involved by more than moral disapprobation, it seemed to make sense at least to refrain from assisting Japan by the sale of American arms.10","['the 1930s', '1938']",course japan buy arm united state 1930 1938 come 9.1 million increase public criticism united state uneasy awareness grow nation provide japan aircraft tank ammunition fight aggressive war china public rally hold letter write newspaper group organize protest practice important committee non participation japanese aggression create initiative missionary china organization typical virtually agree japan engage aggressive war china consensus united state involve moral disapprobation sense refrain assist japan sale arms.10,70,"[1930, 1938]",1934,2,1950,1950
913,"On January 4, 1939, President Roosevelt gave Congress his annual message. It was notable for its lack of new domestic initiatives. Instead, the president focused his attention on international developments, stressing that forces of aggression were growing stronger and that there must be serious cooperative efforts to resist aggressors. The United States, he said, must use all means “short of war” to deter aggression.","['January 4, 1939', 'annual']",january 4 1939 president roosevelt give congress annual message notable lack new domestic initiative instead president focus attention international development stress force aggression grow strong cooperative effort resist aggressor united state say use mean “ short war ” deter aggression,40,[1939],1939,1,1950,1950
914,"What did “short of war” mean? The answer became evident the very next day, when Roosevelt submitted his budget plan for the fiscal year 1940, which included more than $1.3 billion for defense out of the total figure of $9 billion. To devote 15 percent of government outlays for defense was unprecedented in peacetime, but the actual defense spending exceeded this amount as the president continued to ask for, and Congress granted, additional appropriations. In other words, starting in 1939, the United States began a massive armament program to cope with the international crisis. As of that year, the arsenal of American military aircraft, ships, and vehicles was smaller than that of most other powers. For instance, aircraft production for the United States in 1939 came to little more than 2,000 units, in contrast to 10,300 in the Soviet Union, 7,900 in Britain, 8,200 in Germany, and 4,400 in Japan.11 What the nation must now do, and was determined to do, was to catch up and eventually surpass these other countries’ performance in arms manufacturing.","['the very next day', 'the fiscal year 1940', '1939', 'that year', '1939']","“ short war ” mean answer evident day roosevelt submit budget plan fiscal year 1940 include 1.3 billion defense total figure 9 billion devote 15 percent government outlay defense unprecedented peacetime actual defense spending exceed president continue ask congress grant additional appropriation word start 1939 united state begin massive armament program cope international crisis year arsenal military aircraft ship vehicle small power instance aircraft production united state 1939 come little 2,000 unit contrast 10,300 soviet union 7,900 britain 8,200 germany 4,400 japan.11 nation determine catch eventually surpass countries' performance arm manufacturing",91,"[1940, 1939, 1939]",1939,3,1950,1950
915,"This last objective was very important – but risky, as was revealed when a plane carrying French officials crashed on the West Coast in January. They were testing American airplanes for possible purchase, and the accident revealed perhaps more than the president intended about the nation’s commitment to the defense of France. Still, the event did not daunt him or anyone else in the administration who was determined that the United States must take an unequivocal stand against aggression. In July, Lord Riverdale of Sheffield arrived to make a survey of the types of military supplies Britain might be able to count upon from the United States. Combined with the aid to China begun in December 1938, all these steps added up to a policy of defending the current and future victims of German, Italian, and Japanese militarism.","['January', 'July', 'December 1938']",objective important – risky reveal plane carry french official crash west coast january test airplane possible purchase accident reveal president intend nation ’s commitment defense france event daunt administration determine united state unequivocal stand aggression july lord riverdale sheffield arrive survey type military supply britain able count united state combine aid china begin december 1938 step add policy defend current future victim german italian japanese militarism,66,[1938],1938,1,1950,1950
916,"In the meantime, the Roosevelt administration sought to have the existing neutrality legislation repealed. From its point of view, neutrality had clearly outlived whatever purposes it had been intended to serve. There could be no neutrality in a world as transparently divided as it was in 1939. Nothing immediately came of this effort, as substantial segments of Congress were not yet ready for so drastic a step. Roosevelt was willing to settle for a “cash and carry” principle for trade in arms. (This provision, first written into the Neutrality Act of May 1937, specified that belligerents could obtain goods other than arms from the United States so long as they were paid for by cash and carried away in non-U.S. vessels.) Even so, it was only in November, after the outbreak of World War II, that Congress finally revised neutrality laws and authorized the sale of arms to belligerents on the cash-and-carry basis. Though hemmed in by restrictions, the new law was a landmark, indicating the end of American isolation from world conflicts.","['1939', 'May 1937', 'November']",meantime roosevelt administration seek exist neutrality legislation repeal point view neutrality clearly outlive purpose intend serve neutrality world transparently divide 1939 immediately come effort substantial segment congress ready drastic step roosevelt willing settle “ cash carry ” principle trade arm provision write neutrality act 1937 specify belligerent obtain good arm united state long pay cash carry away non u.s vessel november outbreak world war ii congress finally revise neutrality law authorize sale arm belligerent cash carry basis hem restriction new law landmark indicate end isolation world conflict,87,"[1939, 1937]",1938,2,1950,1950
917,"While it stepped up arms production and revised neutrality legislation, the administration also took some initiatives to prevent a further deterioration of international affairs. Here it is interesting to note contrasting approaches to Europe and to Asia. Toward Europe, Roosevelt continued his efforts, begun in 1938, to appeal to world leaders to settle international disputes peacefully and in cooperation. For instance, during the spring and summer of 1939, as tensions rose in Europe and there were expectations of war in the near future, the president sent urgent messages to Hitler and Mussolini for a peaceful settlement of the Polish question. On one occasion, Roosevelt invited them as well as leaders of other countries to name thirty-one countries they would pledge not to invade. He must have known that these overtures would not work, given the irreconcilable positions of Germany, on one hand, and Britain and France, on the other, on the Polish question. He therefore coupled such efforts with an attempt (which did not succeed) to persuade the Soviet Union to cooperate with Britain and France to prevent further German aggression. Beyond such steps, however, Roosevelt did not want to take his country farther in the direction of direct involvement in European affairs. It seemed enough to be in a state of readiness to provide Britain and France with arms, should they be needed.","['1938', 'the spring', 'summer of 1939']",step arm production revise neutrality legislation administration take initiative prevent deterioration international affair interesting note contrast approach europe asia europe roosevelt continue effort begin 1938 appeal world leader settle international dispute peacefully cooperation instance spring summer 1939 tension rise europe expectation war near future president send urgent message hitler mussolini peaceful settlement polish question occasion roosevelt invite leader country thirty country pledge invade know overture work give irreconcilable position germany hand britain france polish question couple effort attempt succeed persuade soviet union cooperate britain france prevent german aggression step roosevelt want country farther direction direct involvement european affair state readiness provide britain france arm need,105,"[1938, 1939]",1938,2,1950,1950
918,"Toward Asia, in contrast, President Roosevelt was willing to be more forceful. Perhaps no other step taken at this time was more crucial in defining America’s Asian policy than the notification presented to Tokyo in July that the United States intended to abrogate the treaty of commerce between the two countries as of January 1940. This was a more drastic measure than anything the president was doing in Europe; to abrogate a treaty of commerce was tantamount to putting bilateral commercial transactions at the mercy of the U.S. authorities, because Japanese shippers, merchants, and bankers engaged in the American trade would no longer be protected by treaty rights.","['July', 'January 1940']",asia contrast president roosevelt willing forceful step take time crucial define america ’s asian policy notification present tokyo july united state intend abrogate treaty commerce country january 1940 drastic measure president europe abrogate treaty commerce tantamount put bilateral commercial transaction mercy u.s authority japanese shipper merchant banker engage trade longer protect treaty right,53,[1940],1940,1,1950,1950
919,"Whence came this geopolitical consciousness? Whatever traces of geopolitics there had been in the period of Theodore Roosevelt would seem to have disappeared, or at least become submerged, by the 1930s. The rise of Nazism or the resurgence of Japanese militarism had not automatically produced power-political thinking; on the contrary, such overseas phenomena had reinforced domestic pacifism, isolationism, and antimilitarism. It was only after 1937 that some began talking about America’s geopolitical role. One of the first books to advocate the new thinking was Livingston Hartley’s Is America Afraid?, published in 1937. The author, a journalist, argued that the domination of Europe by one country (Germany, or it could be the Soviet Union) and Asia by another (Japan, or even China) would be a threat to the United States. Either development could bring about the fall of Britain and the British Empire, whose resources could be put at the service of the hegemonic powers. The United States, Hartley noted, was sandwiched between two landmass powers: the European landmass under German or Soviet control, and the Asian landmass under Japanese or Chinese control. The danger to American security would increase especially if Germany and Japan, emerging as the strongest powers in the two spheres, should combine. They would be not only military powers but autocratic states as well, and thus they would menace the democratic nations. In such a situation, the author asserted, the United States must be prepared to ally itself with Britain; the two shared a great deal in basic policies and interests.12","['the 1930s', '1937', '1937']",come geopolitical consciousness trace geopolitic period theodore roosevelt disappear submerge 1930 rise nazism resurgence japanese militarism automatically produce power political thinking contrary overseas phenomenon reinforce domestic pacifism isolationism antimilitarism 1937 begin talk america ’s geopolitical role book advocate new thinking livingston hartley ’s america afraid publish 1937 author journalist argue domination europe country germany soviet union asia japan china threat united state development bring fall britain british empire resource service hegemonic power united state hartley note sandwich landmass power european landmass german soviet control asian landmass japanese chinese control danger security increase especially germany japan emerge strong power sphere combine military power autocratic state menace democratic nation situation author assert united state prepared ally britain share great deal basic policy interests.12,121,"[1930, 1937, 1937]",1935,3,1950,1950
920,"Few at first noticed the book, but the sort of argument it contained steadily grew in influence. Of its two themes – that democracy was in danger and that the United States must be willing once again to become involved in world politics – the first may have been easier to accept, for by 1937 some confidence in democracy had returned to America. No longer were commentators or politicians speaking defensively or wistfully about democracy, as they had done during the first few years of the Roosevelt administration. Having survived the worst phase of the Depression without having had to abandon democratic government, the Americans of all political affiliations and persuasions could feel that somehow American democracy had weathered its severest test. But just when they regained confidence in their own domestic institutions, they awoke to the danger posed to them from antidemocratic forces overseas. The definition of this national danger was the important first step in redefining their attitude toward international affairs.","['two themes –', '1937', 'the first few years']",notice book sort argument contain steadily grow influence theme – democracy danger united state willing involved world politic – easy accept 1937 confidence democracy return america longer commentator politician speak defensively wistfully democracy year roosevelt administration have survive bad phase depression have abandon democratic government american political affiliation persuasion feel democracy weather severe test regain confidence domestic institution awake danger pose antidemocratic force overseas definition national danger important step redefine attitude international affair,73,[1937],1937,1,1950,1950
921,"The emergence of geopolitical-mindedness was a major phenomenon of American intellectual and diplomatic history. The consciousness of power and the readiness to consider war as an instrument of national policy – such a “realist” response to world affairs was to have a profound impact on the way the American people viewed external events. The new assertiveness in Roosevelt’s foreign policy dovetailed with this intellectual development. It was perhaps fortunate for the United States and for the world that this conjunction of policy and thought had begun to take place by 1939. But, at the same time, the earlier tradition of Wilsonianism would not be totally submerged under the new realism. Henceforth, American foreign policy would have the task of combining geopolitics with Wilsonian internationalism.

922,"The several months between September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, and the spring of 1940, when the target of the attack shifted to Western Europe, have been referred to as the period of a “phony war.” War had been declared by Britain and France immediately after the German invasion of Poland, but there was actually little fighting between the two sides. After Warsaw fell on September 27, there was little further military action, and there were even some attempts at reestablishing a semblance of the status quo in Europe without more bloodshed. Although German and French troops confronted one another along their frontier, they did not exchange fire. There was an atmosphere of unreality, and many doubted whether this was actually the beginning of another world war.","['The several months between September 1939', 'the spring of 1940', 'September 27']",month september 1939 germany invade poland spring 1940 target attack shift western europe refer period “ phony war ” war declare britain france immediately german invasion poland actually little fighting side warsaw fall september 27 little military action attempt reestablish semblance status quo europe bloodshed german french troop confront frontier exchange fire atmosphere unreality doubt actually beginning world war,59,"[1939, 1940]",1940,2,1950,1950
923," And yet there was nothing phony about the developments in Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union, taking advantage of the just-signed nonaggression pact with Germany, sent its troops to Poland from the east, in effect partitioning Poland into two. Soviet forces then turned north, invading Finland in mid-October. The severe fighting continued until March 1940, when the parties signed a peace accord, which included some territorial cessions to the Soviet Union. In Asia, the Sino-Japanese War went on. Although the intensity of ground fighting had abated, Japanese air attacks on Chinese railroads, military bases, and the wartime capital of Chungking were stepped up. In the meantime, just before the German spring offensive began in the west, a group of Chinese politicians led by Wang Jingwei set up a pro-Japanese government in Nanking. This action signaled, among other things, Japan’s determination to stay in China, for without Japanese military support no such puppet regime would survive.

926,"In this, Hitler was partially successful. In the absence of overt German attacks on American individuals, goods, or ships, public opinion in the United States remained opposed to going beyond the cash-and-carry formula to help the democracies. And in February 1940 President Roosevelt sent Under Secretary Sumner Welles to Europe to explore possibilities for peace. Had the Germans succeeded in impressing on Welles their peaceful intentions, U.S. foreign policy might have remained unchanged much longer than it did. In reality, however, Welles returned convinced that the best way of preventing the phony war from developing into something more serious was through making clear America’s intention to come to the aid of Britain and France should Germany decide to plunge Europe into a war of devastation. The episode indicates that there was a limit beyond which the United States would not go. It would not actively seek to mediate between the two sides in the European conflict lest such an attempt should bring about a relative weakening of the democracies’ stand against Germany.

927,"In Asia the situation was even more clear-cut, and here, too, there was little inclination to conciliate Japan. Tokyo extended several overtures in late 1939 and early 1940 as its officials, like their German counterparts, had become fully aware of America’s potential power to frustrate their ambitions. Japanese policy toward the United States during this period was aimed primarily at persuading the latter to restore normal trade relations rather than going through with the announced abrogation of the treaty of commerce. Washington, however, rebuffed such overtures and went ahead with the abrogation of the treaty, which took effect on January 26, 1940. The two nations now entered “the period of no treaties,” as the Japanese called it. The firmness of U.S. policy toward Japan was derived from the conviction that only such an approach would keep Tokyo’s leaders from a more reckless path.","['late 1939', 'early 1940', 'January 26, 1940']",asia situation clear cut little inclination conciliate japan tokyo extend overture late 1939 early 1940 official like german counterpart fully aware america ’s potential power frustrate ambition japanese policy united state period aim primarily persuade restore normal trade relation go announced abrogation treaty commerce washington rebuff overture go ahead abrogation treaty take effect january 26 1940 nation enter “ period treaty ” japanese call firmness u.s policy japan derive conviction approach tokyo ’s leader reckless path,76,"[1939, 1940, 1940]",1940,3,1950,1950
928,"What about the Soviet Union? In the determination to contain German and Japanese ambitions, did the Roosevelt administration consider Russia’s potential usefulness, or did it view the latter as part of the world’s totalitarian, aggressive forces? The moral embargo on arms to Russia, imposed in December 1939 in retaliation against the Soviet invasion of Finland, was still in effect, and the public’s increasing readiness to come to the aid of Britain did not translate into a new view of the Soviet Union as a possible check on the growth of German power. At the same time, many, in and out of the government in Washington, expected that sooner or later the German-Soviet pact would reveal its strains and might even break down as the two powers collided in areas that both coveted, such as the Balkans and Bessarabia. Hitler, in fact, had concluded by the late summer of 1940 that the Soviet Union must be crushed if Britain were to be defeated. The reasoning was simple; with Russia under its control, Germany would have that much more power to bear upon Britain – and upon the United States, which might hesitate to intervene to save the latter under such circumstances. Moreover, should the Soviet Union be weakened, Japanese power in Asia would be considerably strengthened, thus immobilizing the United States.7 Thus persuading himself, Hitler decided, in late December, on a war against the Soviet Union, to be undertaken by May 1941.","['December 1939', 'the late summer of 1940', '–', 'late December', 'May 1941']",soviet union determination contain german japanese ambition roosevelt administration consider russia ’s potential usefulness view world ’s totalitarian aggressive force moral embargo arm russia impose december 1939 retaliation soviet invasion finland effect public ’s increase readiness come aid britain translate new view soviet union possible check growth german power time government washington expect sooner later german soviet pact reveal strain break power collide area covet balkan bessarabia hitler fact conclude late summer 1940 soviet union crush britain defeat reasoning simple russia control germany power bear britain – united state hesitate intervene save circumstance soviet union weaken japanese power asia considerably strengthen immobilize united states.7 persuade hitler decide late december war soviet union undertake 1941,114,"[1939, 1940, 1941]",1940,3,1950,1950

The Atlantic was the obvious choice, given the imminent danger to Britain’s survival.

Everything else, it appeared, had become clear: the German-Japanese combination and the threat it posed to Britain and the United States; the joining of forces by these latter nations; America’s support of China. The early months of the new year confirmed these trends. One of the most important events was the passage of the Lend-Lease Act in March, which authorized the president to sell, transfer, exchange, or lease arms or other materials to any country whose defense was deemed vital to American security. This blanket authorization, which would have been denounced only several months earlier as a presidential usurpation of power, passed the Senate with a two-thirds majority and the House with an even more one-sided vote of 317 to 71, a clear indication that the public was firmly behind such an emergency measure.

931,"In the meantime, American and British officials began conversations (the so-called American-British conversations, or ABC) to coordinate their military strategy – obviously a nonneutral act on the part of the United States, but few people were any longer quibbling over such technicalities. The staff talks produced a plan known as ABC-1, which was based on Rainbow 5 and confirmed the Atlantic priority, focusing on eliminating the German threat before taking on the Japanese menace. As part of the strategy, U.S. naval units began patrolling areas in the western Atlantic (initially the “neutrality zone” established at an inter-American conference held in Panama in October 1939, but now further extended), protecting British ships, and notifying them of the presence of a German submarine should one be sighted.9 The U.S. navy then occupied Greenland, a Danish possession but included within the U.S. patrol area, to build bases and other facilities. In Asia, in the meantime, American, British, and Dutch officials worked out a joint strategy against Japan. They were also in close communication with oil companies in the region to make sure the Japanese would not obtain larger quantities of petroleum, especially in Sumatra, than were contracted for. (Japanese trade missions to Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, invariably were unsuccessful in this regard.)

932,"The missing link was still the Soviet Union. By early 1941, American officials had become convinced that they had enough reliable information of Hitler’s impending attack on that country and that the United States should begin to modify its policy toward Moscow to signal that it was ready to move away from the ostracism of the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939. Hence President Roosevelt approved the lifting of the moral embargo against Russia. Before the Americans could measure the effectiveness of such an approach, however, they were confronted by another development, the April 13 signing of a Japanese-Soviet neutrality treaty, in which each party pledged neutrality in case the other became involved in a war against a third power or a combination of powers. In a joint declaration accompanying the treaty, Japan promised to respect the territorial integrity of Outer Mongolia, and the Soviet Union that of Manchukuo. This latter provision was a remarkable departure in Soviet foreign policy as it amounted to the recognition of the Manchurian puppet regime, a real blow to the Chinese (Nationalists and Communists alike). Hitherto, the Soviet Union had sent more aid to China than any other country had, but the United States was fast catching up. Now, although Soviet officials kept assuring the Chinese that nothing had changed as a result of the Japanese treaty, the latter would have to expect a drastic shift in Moscow’s policy. The Chinese had been urging the Russians to intervene in the Japanese war even by using force. Now such a development could not be contemplated, and the Chinese would have to rely even more heavily than before on American help.","['early 1941', '1939', 'April 13']",missing link soviet union early 1941 official convinced reliable information hitler ’s impend attack country united state begin modify policy moscow signal ready away ostracism soviet union aftermath hitler stalin pact 1939 president roosevelt approve lifting moral embargo russia american measure effectiveness approach confront development april 13 signing japanese soviet neutrality treaty party pledge neutrality case involved war power combination power joint declaration accompany treaty japan promise respect territorial integrity outer mongolia soviet union manchukuo provision remarkable departure soviet foreign policy amount recognition manchurian puppet regime real blow chinese nationalist communist alike hitherto soviet union send aid china country united state fast catch soviet official keep assure chinese change result japanese treaty expect drastic shift moscow ’s policy chinese urge russian intervene japanese war force development contemplate chinese rely heavily help,131,"[1941, 1939]",1940,2,1950,1950

But at least the conversations served to highlight the areas of conflict between the two countries, without some resolution of which there could be no return to a normal relationship.

The United States wanted Japan to end the Chinese war and respect the country’s independence and territorial integrity – in short, to return to the status quo of 1937, if not of 1931. Japan, on the other hand, wanted America to exercise its influence over the Chinese Nationalists so as to bring the latter around to accepting some sort of settlement with Japan.

934,"This last act, which virtually ended commercial transactions between the United States and Japan, was taken on July 25. Three days later, Japanese troops occupied the southern part of French Indochina. This was in continuation of the policy of “southern advance,” first undertaken in September 1940 when Japanese forces were sent to northern Indochina, designed to bring China under control by sealing off the border areas. Through intercepted and decoded Japanese messages, Washington knew of Tokyo’s plans for occupying southern Indochina, so that the freezing of Japanese assets was in part in retaliation against Japan’s southern advance. Obviously, if Japan were allowed to occupy Indochina with impunity, it might go farther south and endanger the British and Dutch colonies as well, with their rich natural resources. At this time, however, it seems that President Roosevelt was even more concerned with Japanese-Soviet relations, and so the freezing order was intended as a clear signal that Japan risked U.S. retaliation if it should turn north against the Soviet Union.11 As if to make doubly sure that the Japanese got the message, Washington instituted a de facto embargo of oil shipments to Japan. (There was no formal embargo, but export licenses for selling petroleum to Japan were denied by an administrative committee set up to administer the freezing order, so in effect no U.S. oil reached Japan after August 1.)","['July 25', 'Three days later', 'September 1940', 'August 1']",act virtually end commercial transaction united state japan take july 25 day later japanese troop occupy southern french indochina continuation policy “ southern advance ” undertake september 1940 japanese force send northern indochina design bring china control seal border area intercept decode japanese message washington know tokyo ’s plan occupy southern indochina freezing japanese asset retaliation japan ’s southern advance obviously japan allow occupy indochina impunity farther south endanger british dutch colony rich natural resource time president roosevelt concerned japanese soviet relation freezing order intend clear signal japan risk u.s retaliation turn north soviet union.11 doubly sure japanese get message washington institute de facto embargo oil shipment japan formal embargo export license sell petroleum japan deny administrative committee set administer freezing order effect u.s oil reach japan august 1,129,[1940],1940,1,1950,1950
935,"In the meantime, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, who had been frequently communicating with each other since the spring of 1940, met in person for several days in early August on American and British warships off the coast of Newfoundland. They further exchanged strategic information and coordinated their military plans for Europe and Asia. In the latter connection, Roosevelt agreed to transmit to Japan a strongly worded warning against further advances southward. The message was considerably toned down when the president met the Japanese ambassador after his return to the capital, because his aides cautioned him against provoking Japan at that point, but the important thing was that the United States and Britain were fully cooperating in Asia as well as in the Atlantic. More than ever, the world was becoming divided between violators and defenders of order, the latter now being joined by the Soviet Union.","['the spring of 1940', 'several days', 'early August']",meantime president roosevelt prime minister churchill frequently communicate spring 1940 meet person day early august british warship coast newfoundland exchange strategic information coordinate military plan europe asia connection roosevelt agree transmit japan strongly word warn advance southward message considerably tone president meet japanese ambassador return capital aide caution provoke japan point important thing united state britain fully cooperate asia atlantic world divide violator defender order join soviet union,68,[1940],1940,1,1950,1950
936,"Thus the months preceding Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor revealed the world divided not only militarily but economically and ideologically as well. On one side were the Axis partners, who were bent on establishing a new world order through conquest and based on revisionist principles. They visualized a globe divided into several regional blocs, each a self-contained economic unit. On the other side stood a coalition of anti-Axis nations, already numbering some seventeen, which struggled to prevent the Axis domination of the world. The former espoused particularism, deglobalization, totalitarianism, and antidemocratic thought, the latter universalism, reglobalization, internationalism, and democratic thought. The enunciation of the Atlantic Charter clearly indicated that the loss of confidence and the sense of uncertainty that had characterized American thought during the 1930s had been overcome and was being replaced by a reawakened self-confidence and by the renewed belief that the United States was once again going to play a leadership role in the world. The twentieth century might become “an American century,” after all. Henry Luce, the publisher of two influential magazines, Time and Life, had, in early 1941, published an essay, “The American Century,” expressing confidence that the world after the war – which he was confident would result in a crushing defeat of the Axis powers – would see the nation’s political, economic, and cultural influence spreading all over the globe. Together with the Atlantic Charter, this essay may be seen as indicating the origins of what would develop as a widely shared image of an Americanized globe. Postwar globalization, in short, was to be seen as Americanization. At the same time, the nation, too, would be further transformed – globalized – in the rest of the century.","['the months preceding', 'the 1930s', 'The twentieth century', 'century', 'early 1941', '– globalized –', 'the century']",month precede japan ’s attack pearl harbor reveal world divide militarily economically ideologically axis partner bend establish new world order conquest base revisionist principle visualize globe divide regional bloc self contain economic unit stand coalition anti axis nation number seventeen struggle prevent axis domination world espouse particularism deglobalization totalitarianism antidemocratic thought universalism reglobalization internationalism democratic thought enunciation atlantic charter clearly indicate loss confidence sense uncertainty characterize thought 1930 overcome replace reawaken self confidence renew belief united state go play leadership role world twentieth century “ century ” henry luce publisher influential magazine time life early 1941 publish essay “ century ” express confidence world war – confident result crush defeat axis power – nation ’s political economic cultural influence spread globe atlantic charter essay see indicate origin develop widely share image americanized globe postwar globalization short see americanization time nation transform – globalize – rest century,146,"[1930, 1941]",1936,2,1950,1950
937,This is not the place to recount in detail the course of the war. Suffice it to say that in terms of military developments there were three stages in the history of World War II as far as the United States was concerned: from December 1941 to January 1943; from January 1943 to August 1944; and from then on to the end of the Pacific war in August 1945. The first three sections in this chapter briefly describe the course of the war in these three stages and point to some key themes in U.S. strategy and foreign policy as the nation fought the war and at the same time prepared for the peace.,"['December 1941', 'January 1943', 'January 1943', 'August 1944', 'August 1945']",place recount detail course war suffice term military development stage history world war ii far united state concern december 1941 january 1943 january 1943 august 1944 end pacific war august 1945 section chapter briefly describe course war stage point key theme u.s strategy foreign policy nation fight war time prepare peace,51,"[1941, 1943, 1943, 1944, 1945]",1943,5,1950,1950

939,"One case in point at the earlier stages of the war was the decision to put off the establishment of a second front in Europe, an assault on German forces in Western Europe to relieve pressures on the eastern (Soviet) front. Most American military leaders, including General George C. Marshall, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, favored an early execution of the second-front strategy, involving a massive buildup of expeditionary forces in England and then an invasion of the northwestern French coast. The British, on the other hand, believed the allies would not be ready to undertake such a strategy for some time to come and in the meantime suggested a North African campaign, to invade the French colonies of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, which remained under the authority of the “Vichy French” – those in France and overseas who collaborated with the Germans. To attack these areas would be to violate their nominally neutral status (because France had left the war), but Churchill persuaded Roosevelt that this strategy would serve to bring the North African coast to allied control, which in turn would enable the allies to prepare for an assault on Sicily and Italy. Although Marshall and others protested that such a strategy was a waste of resources and that, if the cross-Channel invasion were not to take place, U.S. forces should focus on the Pacific theater of the war, in the end they went along with the president’s decision.

940,"This did not mean that the Pacific was neglected. Actually, next to driving out the Germans from Africa, launching a counterattack against Japanese forces became a principal U.S. objective in the early part of the war. Indeed, here the United States had virtual autonomy because neither Britain nor the Soviet Union interfered with American strategy or operations in the Pacific. Although the bulk of the U.S. fleet had been destroyed at Pearl Harbor, that did not prevent Americans from engaging in major battles in the southwestern Pacific. One objective was to prevent Japanese forces from advancing toward Australia, and another was to weaken as much Japanese naval power as possible so as to deny the enemy the luxury of establishing an enlarged Asian-Pacific empire. In the meantime, in the central Pacific, effective use was made of the American aircraft carriers that had escaped the Pearl Harbor disaster (they had fortuitously been out of the naval base). In a crucial battle near the island of Midway in June 1942, U.S. aircraft and ships inflicted heavy losses on an advancing Japanese naval force intent on capturing the island on the way to an invasion of the Hawaiian Islands. This proved to be a turning point in the Pacific war, barely six months after Pearl Harbor.","['June 1942', 'barely six months']",mean pacific neglect actually drive german africa launch counterattack japanese force principal u.s objective early war united state virtual autonomy britain soviet union interfere strategy operation pacific bulk u.s fleet destroy pearl harbor prevent american engage major battle southwestern pacific objective prevent japanese force advance australia weaken japanese naval power possible deny enemy luxury establish enlarged asian pacific empire meantime central pacific effective use aircraft carrier escape pearl harbor disaster fortuitously naval base crucial battle near island midway june 1942 u.s aircraft ship inflict heavy loss advance japanese naval force intent capture island way invasion hawaiian island prove turning point pacific war barely month pearl harbor,106,[1942],1942,1,1950,1950
941," In the Western Hemisphere, Pearl Harbor was followed by another inter-American conference, this time held in Rio de Janeiro in January 1942, where the American republics (with the exception of Argentina) agreed to break diplomatic ties with the Axis powers. Mexico and Brazil soon declared war against them and were eventually to send some of their troops to battle scenes (a Mexican air squadron to the Philippines, Brazilian troops to Italy). In March, an inter-American defense board was set up in Washington to devise joint strategy. Although no actual fighting took place in the hemisphere, initially there was anxiety over the activities of German submarines in the western Atlantic. Of greater relevance at this time, however, was the “bulge” of Brazil, which lay less than two thousand miles from the western edge of North Africa, where an allied invasion was to take place. In order to defend the bulge and also to prepare for the African campaign, the U.S. Army undertook the construction of air bases in the area. During the war, forty such airfields were to be constructed in various parts of Latin America, although after 1943 serious danger to the continent was judged to have diminished so that the need for hemispheric defense would lose its urgency. (Lend-lease shipments to Latin America continued, but they would comprise only 1.1 percent of total military aid offered by the United States.)2","['January 1942', 'March', '1943']",western hemisphere pearl harbor follow inter conference time hold rio de janeiro january 1942 republic exception argentina agree break diplomatic tie axis power mexico brazil soon declare war eventually send troop battle scene mexican air squadron philippine brazilian troop italy march inter defense board set washington devise joint strategy actual fighting take place hemisphere initially anxiety activity german submarine western atlantic great relevance time “ bulge ” brazil lie thousand mile western edge north africa ally invasion place order defend bulge prepare african campaign u.s army undertake construction air base area war airfield construct part latin america 1943 danger continent judge diminish need hemispheric defense lose urgency lend lease shipment latin america continue comprise 1.1 percent total military aid offer united states.)2,122,"[1942, 1943]",1942,2,1950,1950
942,"U.S. forces were not directly involved in the fiercest fighting of the war at that time, that in the eastern front, where the summer (1942) offensive by German forces brought them to Stalingrad. Leningrad had been besieged for several months, and Moscow lay only a hundred miles from the German front line. America’s role here was to step up the shipment of lend-lease goods. Special offices were established in Washington and Moscow to expedite the transaction, and the United States also supported the British and Soviet military occupation of Iran in view of the latter’s crucial importance as a supply route to the Soviet Union. The Middle Eastern Supply Centre was as important a symbol of American commitment to defeat the Axis as more overt military acts.","['the summer (1942', 'several months']",u.s force directly involve fierce fighting war time eastern summer 1942 offensive german force bring stalingrad leningrad besiege month moscow lie mile german line america ’s role step shipment lend lease good special office establish washington moscow expedite transaction united state support british soviet military occupation iran view ’s crucial importance supply route soviet union middle eastern supply centre important symbol commitment defeat axis overt military act,67,[1942],1942,1,1950,1950
943,"In the meantime, the wishes of the Moroccans, Algerians, and Tunisians could not be ignored, for their cooperation would be crucial for the war effort, especially as German propaganda was trying to turn them against the allies. This was part of the larger question: In view of the lofty proclamation (the Atlantic Charter) of August 1941, should not the United States and its allies clarify their position on the future status of the colonial and dependent areas of the world? Should the United States push colonial self-determination as one of its war aims? Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles, for instance, was echoing a main theme in American public opinion when he declared in May 1942 that “our victory must bring in its train the liberation of all peoples.”4","['August 1941', 'May 1942']",meantime wish moroccan algerian tunisian ignore cooperation crucial war effort especially german propaganda try turn ally large question view lofty proclamation atlantic charter august 1941 united state ally clarify position future status colonial dependent area world united state push colonial self determination war aim secretary state sumner welles instance echo main theme public opinion declare 1942 victory bring train liberation peoples.”4,61,"[1941, 1942]",1942,2,1950,1950
944,"President Roosevelt sought to resist such pressures as long as possible so as to avoid making hasty commitments or giving rise to extravagant hopes when he had to concentrate on the war effort. But he could not ignore public discussions of war aims, nor forget that the Atlantic Charter had clearly spelled out visions of the peace that would follow the defeat of the enemy. And in fact there is sufficient evidence to indicate that he was already giving serious thought to the shape of the world after victory. In May 1942, for instance, when Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov visited him in Washington, Roosevelt suggested that after the war four powers – the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and China – might function as “policemen” in ensuring global security. If the “four big policemen” could cooperate in policing the world, then other, lesser nations would not have to maintain large armed forces to prepare against the resurgence of German or Japanese power. The president seems also to have hoped that if such big-power cooperation could be upheld, neither the Soviet Union nor Britain would have to maintain colonies or spheres of influence. In fact, Roosevelt reasoned that the four big powers could serve as “trustees” for the colonial and dependent peoples while they prepared themselves for eventual freedom.5","['May 1942', 'four powers –']",president roosevelt seek resist pressure long possible avoid make hasty commitment give rise extravagant hope concentrate war effort ignore public discussion war aim forget atlantic charter clearly spell vision peace follow defeat enemy fact sufficient evidence indicate give thought shape world victory 1942 instance soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov visit washington roosevelt suggest war power – united state soviet union britain china – function “ policeman ” ensure global security “ big policeman ” cooperate police world less nation maintain large armed force prepare resurgence german japanese power president hop big power cooperation uphold soviet union britain maintain colony sphere influence fact roosevelt reason big power serve “ trustee ” colonial dependent people prepare eventual freedom.5,116,[1942],1942,1,1950,1950
945,"These ideas were clearly Wilsonian. Most members participating in the study groups agreed that the restoration of the principle of international cooperation, rather than old-fashioned balance of power, should be the principal framework for maintenance of order and security after the Axis had been defeated. The enemy countries’ totalitarianism and militarism must be eradicated to ensure a stable peace, but their citizens should be treated leniently. The assumption here was that, despite totalitarian control in Germany and Japan, there were democratic forces in those countries that had been temporarily suppressed but could be encouraged to reemerge once the national leaders had been crushed. These countries should be reintegrated into a new international order, which would be quite different from the 1930s but not altogether a radical departure from what had been visualized before the Depression. For instance, the committees agreed that all postwar territorial changes should be in accordance with the wishes of the peoples involved and that there should be no sphere of influence politically or economically.",['the 1930s'],idea clearly wilsonian member participate study group agree restoration principle international cooperation old fashioned balance power principal framework maintenance order security axis defeat enemy countries’ totalitarianism militarism eradicate ensure stable peace citizen treat leniently assumption despite totalitarian control germany japan democratic force country temporarily suppress encourage reemerge national leader crush country reintegrate new international order different 1930 altogether radical departure visualize depression instance committee agree postwar territorial change accordance wish people involve sphere influence politically economically,76,[1930],1930,1,1950,1950
946,"One sees here a Wilsonian agenda not only because these principles had been articulated by the United States during World War I but also because it was generally believed that the evils of the 1930s were an aberration and that the world of the 1920s, which had reflected some of the Wilsonian principles, had been fundamentally sound. State Department meetings, in other words, were visualizing a return to the pattern of international affairs that had existed before the rise of totalitarianism and aggressive militarism. Of course, it was well recognized that something had to be done to prevent a repetition of the same history, the progression from the hopeful beginnings of the first post–World War I decade to the horrors of the second. The answer, many Americans believed, lay in two elements: America’s active participation in international politics, and the institution of some built-in mechanisms to guard against deglobalization, or excessive economic nationalism. Both elements had been lacking in the 1920s. If the new peace were to be more successful, therefore, it would be necessary to promote these additional policies. Both, of course, assumed continued U.S. involvement in world affairs, political as well as economic. Though more an expression of aspirations than a specific program, such ideas were to become more and more important as the war entered its second phase.","['the 1930s', 'the 1920s', 'the 1920s']",see wilsonian agenda principle articulate united state world war generally believe evil 1930s aberration world 1920 reflect wilsonian principle fundamentally sound state department meeting word visualize return pattern international affair exist rise totalitarianism aggressive militarism course recognize prevent repetition history progression hopeful beginning post – world war decade horror second answer american believe lie element america ’s active participation international politic institution build mechanism guard deglobalization excessive economic nationalism element lack 1920s new peace successful necessary promote additional policy course assume continue u.s involvement world affair political economic expression aspiration specific program idea important war enter second phase,98,"[1930, 1920, 1920]",1923,3,1925,1950
947,"If there ever was a point during World War II when the tide turned, as the cliché goes, it was January 1943, when Soviet forces relieved the siege of Leningrad and forced the Germans to give up Stalingrad. The Soviet counteroffensive was followed elsewhere by the allied invasion of Sicily and Italy (July 1943) and attacks on Japanese-occupied central Pacific islands, notably the Gilbert Islands (November). The climax in Europe came in June 1944, when U.S. and British forces entered Rome and also landed on France’s Normandy coast. That landing opened the long-promised second front and culminated in the liberation of Paris in August. At about the same time, U.S. troops invaded the Marianas, turning some of them (in particular, Saipan and Tinian) into air bases from which to bomb the Japanese homeland.","['January 1943', 'July 1943', 'November', 'June 1944', 'August']",point world war ii tide turn cliché go january 1943 soviet force relieve siege leningrad force german stalingrad soviet counteroffensive follow ally invasion sicily italy july 1943 attack japanese occupy central pacific island notably gilbert island november climax europe come june 1944 u.s british force enter rome land france ’s normandy coast landing open long promise second culminate liberation paris august time u.s troop invade marianas turn particular saipan tinian air base bomb japanese homeland,75,"[1943, 1943, 1944]",1943,3,1950,1950
948,"With the turning of the tide, this second period saw as much interallied goodwill and cooperation as there was ever going to be during the war. Not surprisingly, the attention of the allied powers began shifting to postwar issues. By coincidence, January 1943 saw a meeting of Roosevelt and Churchill at Casablanca. The Casablanca Conference became famous because at its conclusion the two leaders announced the “unconditional surrender” formula, that is, the policy of not discussing peace terms or postwar questions until after the enemy surrendered. Moreover, there would be no unilateral or separate peace; the enemy must surrender to all the allies together. The policy was in reaction against the armistice making of 1918, when, as mentioned earlier, the Germans approached President Wilson to obtain a peace on the basis of the Fourteen Points. This time, Roosevelt was determined never to let the enemy dictate such conditions.","['January 1943', '1918']",turning tide second period see interallied goodwill cooperation go war surprisingly attention ally power begin shift postwar issue coincidence january 1943 see meeting roosevelt churchill casablanca casablanca conference famous conclusion leader announce “ unconditional surrender ” formula policy discuss peace term postwar question enemy surrender unilateral separate peace enemy surrender ally policy reaction armistice make 1918 mention earlier german approach president wilson obtain peace basis fourteen point time roosevelt determine let enemy dictate condition,74,"[1943, 1918]",1930,2,1950,1950

952,"President Roosevelt, as noted earlier, had already visualized adding China to the three, in effect creating the framework of Big Four cooperation after the war. In Asia, as in Europe, such cooperation would be founded upon acceptable territorial adjustments. The Soviet Union, for one, would regain the Kurile Islands and Southern Sakhalin, which had been ceded to Japan in 1875 and 1905, respectively. Britain would regain its empire in Asia, although both Roosevelt and the State Department pushed for some assurances about future self-determination.

953,"Neither was the United States above contemplating its own territorial adjustments. The U.S. navy, for one thing, was keen on retaining some of the Pacific islands after the war to safeguard against resurgent Japanese military power. Roosevelt supported the idea and sent a naval mission to the Pacific in 1943 to investigate possibilities. At the same time, he preferred some kind of trusteeship to outright possession of the islands in question. The form of the trusteeship would depend on the postwar world organization through which it would be carried out, but there was no doubt that the United States would be the sole trustee over the islands.8",['1943'],united state contemplate territorial adjustment u.s navy thing keen retain pacific island war safeguard resurgent japanese military power roosevelt support idea send naval mission pacific 1943 investigate possibility time prefer kind trusteeship outright possession island question form trusteeship depend postwar world organization carry doubt united state sole trustee islands.8,49,[1943],1943,1,1950,1950
954,"But the key to postwar Asia, as distinct from the Pacific Ocean, was to be the inclusion of China in any scheme. The emergence of China as a great power was unmistakably signaled when its leader, Chiang Kai-shek, was invited to meet Roosevelt and Churchill in Cairo at the end of the year to confer on the Asian war and postwar settlements. The Cairo gathering took place while Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin were meeting in Tehran, but the two affairs were kept separate because Stalin did not want to attend a conference to discuss the Japanese war, toward which the Soviet Union was maintaining neutrality. (This did not prevent him from promising that the nation would enter the war against Japan after Germany had been defeated.) In any event, at Cairo it was agreed that China should regain all territory Japan had “stolen” from it since the 1890s, in particular Taiwan and Manchuria. Korea, another Japanese colony, would be promised independence “in due course.” The idea was that until the Koreans were ready for independence, the country might be placed under a trusteeship arrangement, the trustees likely being the United States, the Soviet Union, and China. This was another boost to China’s standing in international affairs.","['the end of the year', 'the 1890s']",key postwar asia distinct pacific ocean inclusion china scheme emergence china great power unmistakably signal leader chiang kai shek invite meet roosevelt churchill cairo end year confer asian war postwar settlement cairo gathering take place roosevelt churchill stalin meet tehran affair keep separate stalin want attend conference discuss japanese war soviet union maintain neutrality prevent promise nation enter war japan germany defeat event cairo agree china regain territory japan “ steal ” 1890s particular taiwan manchuria korea japanese colony promise independence “ course ” idea korean ready independence country place trusteeship arrangement trustee likely united state soviet union china boost china ’s standing international affair,105,[1890],1890,1,1900,1900
955,"Earlier in 1943, the United States had acted to remove two sources of inequities about which the Chinese had complained for decades, first by terminating extraterritorial privileges in China and second by ending the exclusion of Chinese immigrants from America. All these were gratifying developments from the Chinese point of view. For the United States they were an expression of the policy to look to China as the main Asian partner after Japan’s defeat. With American naval power predominant in the Pacific, and with China the new power on the continent, the future of the region could be expected to be much more stable than heretofore. (At a foreign ministers’ conference in Moscow in October, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union confirmed that China would play a role as one of the four principal powers after the war.)","['Earlier in 1943', 'decades', 'October']",earlier 1943 united state act remove source inequity chinese complain decade terminate extraterritorial privilege china second end exclusion chinese immigrant america gratify development chinese point view united state expression policy look china main asian partner japan ’s defeat naval power predominant pacific china new power continent future region expect stable heretofore foreign ministers’ conference moscow october representative united state britain soviet union confirm china play role principal power war,69,[1943],1943,1,1950,1950
956,"Japan, as could be seen in such decisions, was to be reduced to the ranks of a minor power, back where it had been before the 1890s. Neither at this time nor later, however, was there much thought given to dividing Japan into zones of occupation. State Department officials persisted in the idea that the United States would control the occupation of defeated Japan and therefore that it would be unnecessary to establish separate zones of occupation by other powers, as was being contemplated for Germany. This idea was to have far-reaching consequences, as was the conviction on the part of American officials that it should be possible to obtain the cooperation of “friendly” Japanese – prewar liberals, business leaders, and others who had been active in the 1920s and developed close contacts with Americans – in carrying out occupation policies. (There was as yet no definite policy regarding the treatment of the emperor after the war.) While there was clearly an asymmetry between the emerging notion of U.S.-Chinese partnership and the more or less benevolent U.S. occupation of Japan after the latter’s defeat, all these ideas attested to the existence of serious planning for postwar international affairs.","['the 1890s', 'the 1920s', '–']",japan see decision reduce rank minor power 1890s time later think give divide japan zone occupation state department official persist idea united state control occupation defeat japan unnecessary establish separate zone occupation power contemplate germany idea far reach consequence conviction official possible obtain cooperation “ friendly ” japanese – prewar liberal business leader active 1920s develop close contact american – carry occupation policy definite policy treatment emperor war clearly asymmetry emerge notion u.s .- chinese partnership benevolent u.s occupation japan ’s defeat idea attest existence planning postwar international affair,89,"[1890, 1920]",1905,2,1925,1950

It should also be noted in this connection that the United States was already, by 1943–4, visualizing itself as a nuclear power, equipped with atomic weapons, which were being developed in great secrecy in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The idea of using atomic energy (created either by fission or fusion of uranium atoms) to make an unprecedentedly explosive and destructive bomb had existed for several years, and both sides in the war were avidly trying to manufacture such bombs. Once they were developed, there was little doubt that they would be used. But there was the equally important question of their future use, when the enemy had been defeated, with or without the new weapon. At a meeting they held in Quebec in August 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill discussed the question and signed a secret protocol to the effect that the two nations would continue to share atomic secrets and consult with one another regarding their use in the future. Neither the Soviet Union nor any other power would be brought into their confidence. Because the United States would clearly be the senior of the two atomic partners, this memorandum – and the ideas expressed there were reiterated by the two leaders at the second Quebec conference of August 1944 – suggests that in addition to the various territorial arrangements being discussed with the allies, there was a presupposition of the United States emerging as the sole superpower out of the victory, at least insofar as military force was concerned.9","['several years', 'August 1943', '–', 'August 1944']",power political arrangement ally contemplate postwar world axis power keep weak big replace definer international order united state emerge major power pacific western hemisphere interest maintain hemispheric strategic coordination postwar period note connection united state 1943–4 visualize nuclear power equip atomic weapon develop great secrecy los alamos new mexico idea atomic energy create fission fusion uranium atom unprecedentedly explosive destructive bomb exist year side war avidly try manufacture bomb develop little doubt equally important question future use enemy defeat new weapon meeting hold quebec august 1943 roosevelt churchill discuss question sign secret protocol effect nation continue share atomic secret consult use future soviet union power bring confidence united state clearly senior atomic partner memorandum – idea express reiterate leader second quebec conference august 1944 – suggest addition territorial arrangement discuss ally presupposition united state emerge sole superpower victory insofar military force concerned.9,142,"[1943, 1944]",1944,2,1950,1950
958,"What about the other aspects of international relations, economic and cultural? The Wilsonian impulse evinced by the State Department’s postwar planning committees never abated, and during 1943–4 they were joined by an increasing number of American individuals and groups calling for a new internationalism – an internationalism that would be Wilsonian in inspiration but would be “new” in the recognition of the need to work closely with other military powers, such as China and the Soviet Union, as well as Great Britain. Their hope was that these nations would share the principles and values embodied in the Atlantic Charter and cooperate together in implementing them after the war. More specifically, by 1943 there was a clear public consensus in the United States in support of the nation’s participation in a new world organization. Even erstwhile isolationists, notably Senator Arthur Vandenberg (R.-Mich.), came out in favor of such a step, and the Republican party issued a policy statement endorsing U.S. membership in a postwar international organization. Such membership, however, would mean little unless it were supported by economic underpinnings. This was the task the Bretton Woods Conference was to undertake in 1944. In the meantime, the United Nations established the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to distribute food and supplies to war-devastated areas as they were liberated by the allies.","['1943', '1944']",aspect international relation economic cultural wilsonian impulse evince state department ’s postwar planning committee abate 1943–4 join increase number individual group call new internationalism – internationalism wilsonian inspiration “ new ” recognition need work closely military power china soviet union great britain hope nation share principle value embody atlantic charter cooperate implement war specifically 1943 clear public consensus united state support nation ’s participation new world organization erstwhile isolationist notably senator arthur vandenberg r .- mich come favor step republican party issue policy statement endorse u.s membership postwar international organization membership mean little support economic underpinning task bretton wood conference undertake 1944 meantime united nation establish relief rehabilitation administration unrra distribute food supply war devastate area liberate ally,118,"[1943, 1944]",1944,2,1950,1950
959,"In the cultural realm, it was well recognized that for the duration of the war all belligerents – the United Nations allies and the Axis powers alike – would have to concentrate on propaganda work, aimed both at the home front and at enemy countries. Cultural internationalism was a luxury unless it was relevant to the war effort. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that earlier activities sponsored by the League of Nations in promoting cross-cultural cooperation were never forgotten; those who had taken part in them, as well as many others who shared their views, sought to keep alive the legacy, and they were determined to resurrect it once the war came to an end. This can be seen, for instance, in the series of meetings of allied ministers of education that began to take place in London as early as 1942. Although the initial aim of the meetings was to help schoolchildren suffering from wartime destruction and deprivation, in time the delegates became equally interested in preparing for a postwar agenda. Americans began participating in these meetings in 1943, and in April 1944 a high-level delegation, including Representative J. William Fulbright (D.-Ark.) and Librarian of Congress Archibald MacLeish, was sent to London to join colleagues from elsewhere in discussing the establishment of a successor to the League’s intellectual cooperation committee. There was a basic continuity from these beginnings to the postwar founding of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).10","['–', 'as early as 1942', '1943', 'April 1944']",cultural realm recognize duration war belligerent – united nation ally axis power alike – concentrate propaganda work aim home enemy country cultural internationalism luxury relevant war effort worth note early activity sponsor league nation promote cross cultural cooperation forget take share view seek alive legacy determine resurrect war come end see instance series meeting ally minister education begin place london early 1942 initial aim meeting help schoolchildren suffer wartime destruction deprivation time delegate equally interested prepare postwar agenda american begin participate meeting 1943 april 1944 high level delegation include representative j. william fulbright d .- ark librarian congress archibald macleish send london join colleague discuss establishment successor league ’s intellectual cooperation committee basic continuity beginning postwar founding united nation educational scientific cultural organization unesco).10,124,"[1942, 1943, 1944]",1943,3,1950,1950
960,"Whether the hopeful beginnings of the new internationalism could develop into a solid structure of postwar world affairs depended on what the allies would do, individually and collectively, with the areas they were fast recovering and occupying from the summer of 1944 onward. With the liberation of France and the Low Countries in the west, and the Soviet counteroffensive and occupation of Poland, Bulgaria, Rumania, Yugoslavia, and then eventually eastern Germany, the wartime alliance was clearly reaching its climactic successes. In the Pacific, too, the same months witnessed the beginning of the bombing of Japan proper as well as the invasion of the Philippines, leading to their reconquest by U.S. forces. The big question now was the impact of such successes, which would surely bring the war to an end in the near future, upon the alliance. Would victory perpetuate the alliance, or would the allies go their separate ways once the war ended? How could they sustain their wartime cooperation and form a solid framework for postwar international order?","['the summer of 1944 onward', 'the same months']",hopeful beginning new internationalism develop solid structure postwar world affair depend ally individually collectively area fast recover occupy summer 1944 onward liberation france low country west soviet counteroffensive occupation poland bulgaria rumania yugoslavia eventually eastern germany wartime alliance clearly reach climactic success pacific month witness beginning bombing japan proper invasion philippine lead reconquest u.s force big question impact success surely bring war end near future alliance victory perpetuate alliance ally separate way war end sustain wartime cooperation form solid framework postwar international order,83,[1944],1944,1,1950,1950
961,"The idea of big-power cooperation, however, underwent subtle changes after mid-1944 because two of the Big Four – Britain and China – became weaker relative to the other two. Officials in and out of Britain readily admitted that the nation was bankrupt and that its economic difficulties and financial stringencies would make problematic whether it could continue to play the role of a world power – unless the United States helped out. The latter did not want Britain weakened, and Roosevelt, as noted, made sure that the American-British monopoly of atomic weapons technology would be retained. The idea was that Britain could still be important as a balancer of Soviet power.

962,"China, too, began to shed some of its power and prestige in the fall of 1944. This was in part a reflection of the Pacific strategy of the United States, whose successful “island-hopping” campaign was making the CBI theater of the war less crucial for the defeat of Japan. President Roosevelt did want to use Chinese and U.S. forces on the Asian continent to tie Japanese troops down and prevent their return to Japan to defend the home islands. But he got into trouble with Chiang Kai-shek for suggesting that General Stilwell be placed in command of all forces in China, including Communist troops. The request infuriated Chiang, who was determined to prevent a Communist takeover of power after the war. With Japan’s defeat a matter of time, factions in China were positioning themselves for the postwar struggle, and Chiang believed that accepting Roosevelt’s suggestion was tantamount to committing suicide.

963,"This became clear at two important international conferences of 1944, at Bretton Woods (July) and Dumbarton Oaks (October). The former was an occasion for reestablishing international economic order – reglobalizing the world economy – after it had been destroyed by the Depression and by the autarkic policies of the powers. The conferees, including John Maynard Keynes, the famous British economist, agreed that the kind of chaotic economic nationalism that had been the rule since the 1930s must be replaced by some arrangement for international cooperation. But the participants also knew that merely to return to the situation existing before 1929 would not be enough; international economic transactions of the 1920s, as well as before the First World War, had been based on a gold exchange system, which worked well so long as trade and investments across national boundaries flowed without interruption, and so long as governments were willing to control spending in order to bolster the value of their currencies. The Depression had indicated how fragile the whole structure was. What was now needed, it was thought, was an institutional mechanism with which stable rates of exchange among different currencies could be preserved, without, however, each country’s having to adopt a fiscally conservative policy to maintain the value of its own currency. (It was widely accepted that such a policy had kept consumption down and unemployment high.) This task, the forty-four countries represented at Bretton Woods agreed, could be accomplished by establishing an International Monetary Fund (IMF) that would provide temporary relief to countries experiencing trade and exchange difficulties so that they would not have to resort to protectionism or devaluation – or to domestic retrenchment policies that would give rise to unemployment. The IMF, with its initial capital of $8,800 million, would be a new experiment; nothing like that had ever existed in world economic affairs, and it marked a new era of international cooperation that would go much beyond such traditional areas as security and arms control. Henceforth, economic globalization would operate under a system of international cooperation; in other words, transnational developments would be sustained by intergovernmental underpinnings.","['1944', 'July', 'October', '–', 'the 1930s', '1929', 'the 1920s', '–']","clear important international conference 1944 bretton wood july dumbarton oak october occasion reestablish international economic order – reglobaliz world economy – destroy depression autarkic policy power conferee include john maynard keynes famous british economist agree kind chaotic economic nationalism rule 1930 replace arrangement international cooperation participant know merely return situation exist 1929 international economic transaction 1920s world war base gold exchange system work long trade investment national boundary flow interruption long government willing control spending order bolster value currency depression indicate fragile structure need think institutional mechanism stable rate exchange different currency preserve country ’ have adopt fiscally conservative policy maintain value currency widely accept policy keep consumption unemployment high task country represent bretton wood agree accomplish establish international monetary fund imf provide temporary relief country experience trade exchange difficulty resort protectionism devaluation – domestic retrenchment policy rise unemployment imf initial capital 8,800 million new experiment like exist world economic affair mark new era international cooperation traditional area security arm control henceforth economic globalization operate system international cooperation word transnational development sustain intergovernmental underpinning",174,"[1944, 1930, 1929, 1920]",1931,4,1950,1950
964,"In the meantime, at Dumbarton Oaks, delegates from the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and China established a basis for a postwar international organization. The idea itself was not new, but now they were ready to start drafting the specifics of such an organization, which was to be called the United Nations, an indication that they were determined to continue their wartime cooperation into the postwar period. The delegates also knew that the United Nations would have to be more effective than the League of Nations. Reflecting Roosevelt’s long-standing conception of big-power cooperation, with which the other three governments were in agreement, the conference proposed the setting up of a Security Council, with the Big Four as the permanent members. (France was to be added in 1945.) They would cooperate with one another and in effect seek to police the world. The Soviet Union, however, insisted on complete unanimity among the four before the Security Council took any action.

With Germany’s surrender expected momentarily, the leaders’ attention focused on defeating Japan as expeditiously as possible. Stalin renewed his pledge that the Soviet Union would enter the war against Japan about three months after the German surrender. He also agreed to continue to deal with the Nationalists in China as the legitimate government, even though their authority was now openly being challenged by the Communists.

966,"In this sense, the end of the German war, on May 8, 1945, may be said to have come too soon. Roosevelt had died on April 12, and the new president, Harry S. Truman, had not had time to develop his own approach to postwar problems before the European war was completed. Having crushed Germany, the allies were now tempted to go their separate ways. The Japanese war still necessitated their cooperation, but to a much lesser extent, and some in the United States even began to argue that Soviet participation in the Pacific war might not be necessary; it might not even be desirable, as it would further extend Soviet power in Asia. Some officials wanted a political end to the Japanese war; believing, perhaps correctly, that the Japanese could be induced to stop fighting once they were assured that the allies did not intend to destroy their emperor institution, they advocated approaching Japan for a possible cease-fire on this basis. President Truman, however, did not agree, convinced that public opinion would not accept any promise to save the emperor and that Soviet participation was strategically imperative to minimize the costs of the American invasion of the Japanese homeland, which was visualized for 1946.11","['May 8, 1945', 'April 12']",sense end german war 8 1945 say come soon roosevelt die april 12 new president harry s. truman time develop approach postwar problem european war complete have crush germany ally tempt separate way japanese war necessitate cooperation less extent united state begin argue soviet participation pacific war necessary desirable extend soviet power asia official want political end japanese war believe correctly japanese induce stop fight assure ally intend destroy emperor institution advocate approach japan possible cease fire basis president truman agree convince public opinion accept promise save emperor soviet participation strategically imperative minimize cost invasion japanese homeland visualize 1946.11,99,[1945],1945,1,1950,1950
967," The result was that, during the months following Germany’s defeat, the wartime coalition, already strained after the autumn of 1944, was put to a severe test. With the disappearance of the common enemy, the task was not easy. The alliance would now have to be redefined for peace, but the shape of the peace itself depended on their cooperation, or lack thereof. In such a fluid situation, only a determined effort at preserving the coalition would have worked. It is to the credit of Truman, Stalin, and Churchill (as well as Clement Attlee, who replaced Churchill after the Conservative party’s defeat at the elections in July) that they did continue their efforts in this direction. For instance, much was accomplished at a conference of fifty nations, meeting in San Francisco from the end of April through the end of July, to complete the drafting of the charter of the United Nations. The charter was a ringing declaration of the nations’ determination to work together to preserve the peace and to cooperate in punishing future aggressors through collective action. The preamble also enumerated the fundamental principles for which the postwar world was to strive. It declared,

968,"The history of the world transformation of 1913–45 is also a story of the transformation of America’s role in the world. Europe, the center of international relations into which other parts of the globe, including the United States, had been fitted, lost its primacy after World War I. The years after 1917 marked the emergence of the United States as the world’s leader. Even when it did not actually lead through military force (such as in the 1920s), it provided economic and cultural resources to define and sustain global order. The mid-1930s were an exception in that the nation eschewed international leadership or cooperation at all levels and retreated to nationalism and unilateralism, but even then it was clear that sooner or later it was “bound to lead,” to use Joseph Nye’s phrase.12 It could not have done otherwise, unless its leaders and people – and millions of others elsewhere – had been content to live in a world divided into separate spheres, many of them under totalitarian control. And the moment for leadership came sooner than expected, with the German invasion of Poland in 1939 and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor two years later. Now the United States became involved, militarily, economically, and politically, in all parts of the world: the Western Hemisphere, the Atlantic, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Pacific.

Similarly, when the terms of the Anglo-American mutual aid pact, or “lend-lease” agreement, of 1942 were negotiated, American negotiators remorselessly pushed British supplicants a step further toward the multilateral, nondiscriminatory postwar economic order Hull and Morgenthau were determined to create.1","['August 1941', '1942']",august 1941 roosevelt winston churchill produce atlantic charter ostensibly eloquent description aim resist hitler aide fight deck american attempt force desperate british friend surrender system imperial preference favor british trade discriminate british empire similarly term anglo mutual aid pact “ lend lease ” agreement 1942 negotiate negotiator remorselessly push british supplicant step multilateral nondiscriminatory postwar economic order hull morgenthau determine create.1,61,"[1941, 1942]",1942,2,1950,1950
973,"The apotheosis of the American vision emerged from the Bretton Woods (New Hampshire) Conference of 1944. In July of that year the representatives of forty-four nations agreed to the outline of a postwar monetary system. American officials, specifically Roosevelt, Morgenthau, and his principal deputy at the Treasury Department, Harry Dexter White, perceived the conference and the agreements they sought as the economic basis for the postwar operation of the Grand Alliance. Economic interdependence, a shared stake in a postwar economic order, would bind Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States in peace, as fear of Hitler had brought them together in war. The cooperation of the British, the world’s leading traders, whose pound sterling, like the dollar, constituted a basic currency of international trade, was perceived by American leaders to be essential. The Bretton Woods Conference quickly became a negotiation between White for the Americans and John Maynard Keynes, representing Great Britain. Officials of the Soviet Union participated, but, as a nation committed to state-controlled trade, the Soviets were less interested in the details of the agreement than in demonstrating their great-power status and their willingness to work with their allies to eliminate trade and currency issues as causes of international tension. Eager to keep them on board, White indulged them from time to time, but the Soviets were peripheral to what was primarily an Anglo-American show.2","['Conference of 1944', 'July of that year']",apotheosis vision emerge bretton wood new hampshire conference 1944 july year representative nation agree outline postwar monetary system official specifically roosevelt morgenthau principal deputy treasury department harry dexter white perceive conference agreement seek economic basis postwar operation grand alliance economic interdependence shared stake postwar economic order bind great britain soviet union united state peace fear hitler bring war cooperation british world ’s lead trader pound sterling like dollar constitute basic currency international trade perceive leader essential bretton wood conference quickly negotiation white american john maynard keynes represent great britain official soviet union participate nation commit state control trade soviet interested detail agreement demonstrate great power status willingness work ally eliminate trade currency issue cause international tension eager board white indulge time time soviet peripheral primarily anglo show.2,127,[1944],1944,1,1950,1950

They were committing their countries to a goal whose realization would have to be postponed until the exigencies of reconstruction had been met. In retrospect it seems clear that the Americans, at least, had underestimated the damage war had inflicted on the British economy, the general problems and costs of postwar reconstruction, the needs of developing countries, and the opposition to an international trade organization designed to dismantle protectionist structures. Certainly few if any among them imagined that it would be 1958 before anything approximating full currency convertibility could be instituted – and even then for only that part of the world that looked to the United States for protection.","['the day', '1958', '–']",hand keynes white participate planner knowledgeable banker economist invite bretton wood understand new liberal international trading order materialize day war end commit country goal realization postpone exigency reconstruction meet retrospect clear american underestimate damage war inflict british economy general problem cost postwar reconstruction need develop country opposition international trade organization design dismantle protectionist structure certainly imagine 1958 approximate currency convertibility institute – world look united state protection,67,[1958],1958,1,1975,2000

Hogan has called the “New Deal synthesis.”4 The stalwart forces of economic nationalism had been driven back, and much of the trading world committed to the liberal program. The emphasis would be on increasing trade, increasing productivity, on a larger share for everyone rather than a struggle to redistribute existing wealth. Government, business, and labor would work in tandem to realize the new order.

976,"When the Big Three met at Tehran in November 1943, and throughout 1944, Stalin’s anxieties had been evident, his fear of a resurgent Germany palpable. Roosevelt shared Stalin’s apprehensions and unhesitatingly offered his assurances that the steps necessary to prevent a postwar resurrection of German power would be taken: Germany would be subdued, pacified, and perhaps even dismembered. Stalin’s security concerns in Eastern Europe were marginally more troublesome. Certainly he was entitled to a buffer of not unfriendly nations on Soviet borders, to what some would call a “sphere of influence.” The Soviet desire to rearrange Poland’s geographic position, to move the country some distance to the west – at Germany’s expense, and to the advantage of the Soviets who would annex a slice of eastern Poland – would surely upset the Poles. It would likely upset Cordell Hull and a host of other Americans religiously committed to the principle of self-determination. But if some modest rearranging of the map was all that was necessary to bind the Big Three in peace, it was hardly too high a price to pay. Certainly Roosevelt would not scruple to barter German for Polish real estate, though he had title to neither, in the name of world peace. The Poles, to be sure, had the right to self-determination, which was still possible, albeit with minor territorial adjustments. On the other hand, the Soviet Union had won the right to secure borders.

977,"The Polish question posed a domestic political problem for Roosevelt, which he assumed he could finesse. If Polish Americans concluded he was betraying Poland, they might well desert the Democratic party, hurt his reelection prospects in 1944 and the prospects for his party for a generation after. Ideologues might harass him and hamper his efforts toward a just peace, as they had used territorial concessions to Japan made at Versailles in 1919 to savage Woodrow Wilson and his peace treaty. Opponents of Roosevelt’s conception of America’s role in the postwar world order or of cooperation with the Soviet Union might distort the issue to their advantage. He conveyed his concerns to Stalin at Tehran and in the months that followed – and he depended on Stalin to arrange affairs in Poland in a manner that would be acceptable to the American people. It was important that Stalin understand that even a strong president in the most powerful nation the world had ever known faced restraints and could use a little help from his friends.","['1944', '1919', 'the months']",polish question pose domestic political problem roosevelt assume finesse polish american conclude betray poland desert democratic party hurt reelection prospect 1944 prospect party generation ideologue harass hamper effort peace territorial concession japan versaille 1919 savage woodrow wilson peace treaty opponent roosevelt ’s conception america ’s role postwar world order cooperation soviet union distort issue advantage convey concern stalin tehran month follow – depend stalin arrange affair poland manner acceptable people important stalin understand strong president powerful nation world know face restraint use little help friend,85,"[1944, 1919]",1932,2,1950,1950
978,"We are far less certain even today – and likely will never be certain – about Stalin’s vision of the postwar world. There seems no reason to doubt his indifference toward the liberal international economic order the United States wanted. He saw no place in that system for the Soviet Union, with its command economy and state trading organizations. It might have been vaguely threatening, but Stalin gave no indication that he was much troubled by it before 1947. The lessons he drew from the 1930s – every man his own historian – had little to do with exchange rates and tariff barriers. The Soviet Union strove toward autarky and would risk economic dependence on no foreign power. No, the Soviet Union had suffered because the capitalist world, led by Great Britain, had been implacably hostile, and, having failed to prevent the success of the Bolshevik Revolution, had encircled and attempted to destroy its heirs. Ultimately, the enemies of the Soviet Union had unleashed Hitler. Shrewdly, Stalin had bought nearly two years with the Nazi-Soviet pact, but Hitler had attacked nonetheless – and come dangerously close to toppling the Soviet regime. More than twenty million Soviet citizens had lost their lives. The country had been devastated by the Nazi invaders. Grudgingly, the British and the Americans had joined forces with the Russians against Hitler, providing modest but essential material support. For two and a half years, however, Roosevelt and Churchill had rejected Stalin’s pleas for a second front in France, leaving Soviet troops to engage 80 percent of the German army. Like Roosevelt, Stalin saw no harm in the United Nations Organization, provided the Soviet Union had multiple votes in the General Assembly (he thought sixteen would be adequate) and a veto in the Security Council to protect its interests. But he was no fool: He would rely neither on the goodwill of his newfound friends nor the efficacy of the United Nations to provide for Soviet security. German power would have to be broken, its wealth used to repair the damage the German military had inflicted on the Soviet Union. Germany would have to be occupied. The so-called Baltic republics would have to be restored to the Russian empire, as would territory the Poles, Finns, and Romanians had taken. No Eastern European country could be allowed to become a springboard for a new aggression against the Soviet Union: All would have “friendly” governments, responsive to Soviet requirements. Optimally, there would be adjustments to the south, at the expense of Iran, Afghanistan, and pro-German Turkey. And when the time came for Soviet forces to participate in the defeat of Japan, Stalin had ideas for buffers and bases in East Asia, not only in what was now the Japanese empire, but in China, where both Nationalist and Communist contenders for power had displeased him, as well. Stalin even had occasional dreams of extending his reach into Africa, of being awarded some of Italy’s former colonies on that continent by his grateful allies.8","['today –', '1947', 'the 1930s –', 'nearly two years', '–', 'two and a half years']",far certain today – likely certain – stalin ’s vision postwar world reason doubt indifference liberal international economic order united state want see place system soviet union command economy state trading organization vaguely threatening stalin give indication trouble 1947 lesson draw 1930 – man historian – little exchange rate tariff barrier soviet union strive autarky risk economic dependence foreign power soviet union suffer capitalist world lead great britain implacably hostile have fail prevent success bolshevik revolution encircle attempt destroy heir ultimately enemy soviet union unleash hitler shrewdly stalin buy nearly year nazi soviet pact hitler attack nonetheless – come dangerously close topple soviet regime million soviet citizen lose life country devastate nazi invader grudgingly british american join force russian hitler provide modest essential material support half year roosevelt churchill reject stalin ’s plea second france leave soviet troop engage 80 percent german army like roosevelt stalin see harm united nation organization provide soviet union multiple vote general assembly think sixteen adequate veto security council protect interest fool rely goodwill newfound friend efficacy united nation provide soviet security german power break wealth repair damage german military inflict soviet union germany occupy call baltic republic restore russian empire territory pole finn romanian take eastern european country allow springboard new aggression soviet union “ friendly ” government responsive soviet requirement optimally adjustment south expense iran afghanistan pro german turkey time come soviet force participate defeat japan stalin idea buffer base east asia japanese empire china nationalist communist contender power displease stalin occasional dream extend reach africa award italy ’s colony continent grateful allies.8,260,"[1947, 1930]",1938,2,1950,1950
979,"Curiously, Churchill had proved relatively easy to deal with. He sat at the table with Stalin one night in the autumn of 1944 and in a matter of minutes the two men had achieved an equitable division of influence in Eastern Europe. Roosevelt was more elusive, apparently more sympathetic to Soviet aspirations, even suggesting the possibility of Soviet-American collusion against British imperialism, but unwilling to make firm commitments about giving the Soviet Union a free hand in Eastern Europe, forever blathering about the need to appease public opinion in the United States, dallying with anti-Soviet Poles. And then there was the evidence Soviet intelligence had brought Stalin that the United States was working with the British on a secret weapon, an atom bomb, about which Roosevelt had said nothing to his loyal Soviet ally. Clearly, satisfactory postwar relations among the victors were by no means assured. It was a time for caution – and however ruthless he was, Stalin had not survived in the Soviet system of his day without being a very cautious man.","['the autumn of 1944', '–', 'his day']",curiously churchill prove relatively easy deal sit table stalin night autumn 1944 matter minute man achieve equitable division influence eastern europe roosevelt elusive apparently sympathetic soviet aspiration suggest possibility soviet collusion british imperialism unwilling firm commitment give soviet union free hand eastern europe forever blather need appease public opinion united state dally anti soviet pole evidence soviet intelligence bring stalin united state work british secret weapon atom bomb roosevelt say loyal soviet ally clearly satisfactory postwar relation victor mean assure time caution – ruthless stalin survive soviet system day cautious man,91,[1944],1944,1,1950,1950
980,"In East Asia, a very different set of circumstances prevailed in the closing months of the war. Chiang Kai-shek, the tenacious Chinese leader, sat in Chongqing (Chungking), husbanding his forces, waiting for his American allies to rid his country of the Japanese invaders. His concerns were, conceivably, even graver than those of Roosevelt and Stalin: The survival of his regime was still very much in question. In 1944 the Japanese were still capable of – and did in fact launch – another offensive. Within Chiang’s government, there were several prominent figures, mostly military men, ready and eager to succeed him if he faltered. Off in Yan’an, in the northwest of his country, Communist forces hostile to his regime controlled an extensive area and were primed to expand as soon as the Japanese retreated. Indeed, Chiang, to the irritation of the Americans, had posted half a million of his best-equipped forces as a barrier to Communist expansion rather than risk those assets against the Japanese. Increasingly, the Americans were pressing him to engage the Japanese more, threatening to align themselves with other forces in the country more willing to fight. Inevitably, the Americans would expel the Japanese, but then what? Resumption of civil war with the Communists was inescapable. An increased Soviet presence on China’s borders was certain – and a victorious Stalin, unchecked by Japan, would be a demanding neighbor. And the British imperialists would return to Hong Kong. With limited control over his own country, with China no match for the allegedly friendly great powers moving in on it, Chiang had to count on his own demonstrated ability to manipulate Roosevelt and Stalin. He had to rely on the traditional Chinese practice of playing barbarians off against each other, to China’s advantage.","['the closing months', '1944', '–']",east asia different set circumstance prevail closing month war chiang kai shek tenacious chinese leader sit chongqing chungking husband force wait ally rid country japanese invader concern conceivably graver roosevelt stalin survival regime question 1944 japanese capable – fact launch – offensive chiang ’s government prominent figure military man ready eager succeed falter yan’an northwest country communist force hostile regime control extensive area prim expand soon japanese retreat chiang irritation american post half million best equip force barrier communist expansion risk asset japanese increasingly american press engage japanese threaten align force country willing fight inevitably american expel japanese resumption civil war communist inescapable increase soviet presence china ’s border certain – victorious stalin unchecked japan demand neighbor british imperialist return hong kong limited control country china match allegedly friendly great power move chiang count demonstrate ability manipulate roosevelt stalin rely traditional chinese practice play barbarian china ’s advantage,148,[1944],1944,1,1950,1950

Chiang, as always, wanted more aid from the United States, wanted more action by American forces in China. Roosevelt, as always, made vague promises, and asked for more action from the Chinese.

So long as Hitler’s army battered the gates of Moscow and Leningrad, Stalin’s attention was riveted on his European front. Stalin nonetheless had claims on Chinese territory and, when the Germans had been turned back in 1943, and Soviet forces took the offensive, he remembered Chinese intrusions into the sphere of influence he had fashioned in Xinjiang (Sinkiang) in Central Asia. No longer needing Chinese forces to engage the Japanese, confident the Americans could manage that, Stalin attempted in 1944 to drive the Chinese from territory he considered his domain, reminding Chiang that the Soviet Union was not to be taken lightly.10 And, as the months passed, Stalin perceived new opportunities for the Soviet state to rival the achievements of tsarist imperialism, regaining not only territory from the Japanese, whom he would attack in due course, but a sphere of influence from the Chinese, whom he would soon help liberate.

The Japanese had interrupted Chiang’s efforts to exterminate the Communists during the 1930s; Chiang would certainly resume his effort at war’s end. The Americans, however, had been friendly throughout the war, and Mao’s trusted emissary, Zhou Enlai, had spent much of the war years in Chongqing successfully wooing the Americans and alerting them to the seamier side of Chiang’s activities. Concerned primarily with defeating the Japanese, the Americans had enlisted Communist support and appeared determined to prevent Chiang from precipitating a civil war. Progressive forces seemed to be in control in the United States, cooperating with the Soviet Union. Mao and Zhou wondered whether the Americans would remain friendly after the war and what role the United States might play in China.","['the 1930s', 'the war years']",yan’an mao zedong chinese communist leader struggle maneuver japanese chiang uncertain expect american soviet japanese interrupt chiang ’s effort exterminate communist 1930s chiang certainly resume effort war ’s end american friendly war mao ’s trust emissary zhou enlai spend war year chongqing successfully woo american alert seamy chiang ’s activity concern primarily defeat japanese american enlist communist support appear determined prevent chiang precipitate civil war progressive force control united state cooperate soviet union mao zhou wonder american remain friendly war role united state play china,85,[1930],1930,1,1950,1950

He had tried unsuccessfully to use, perhaps even sacrifice, the Chinese Communists, in suicidal attacks on the Japanese, to protect the Soviet Union in the late 1930s. He had chased Chinese Communist forces out of territories Mao considered Chinese. And the intensely nationalistic Mao was aware of Stalin’s plans for Mongolia and perhaps suspected other Soviet claims on Chinese soil—as in Xinjiang, where Stalin was financing and arming Uighur separatists. It had taken a great deal of ingenuity and good fortune for Mao to rise to the top of the Communist party and for the party to survive the misfortunes of the 1920s and 1930s.

987,"Franklin D. Roosevelt, four-time president of the United States, died in April 1945, on the eve of victory in Europe. Before his death, at Yalta in February 1945 and in the weeks that followed, he tried desperately to secure the enduring peace toward which he had labored so valiantly. At Yalta, discussions with Churchill and Stalin had gone well. Roosevelt found the other allied leaders frank but reasonable in their demands. Toward his own requirements, they were remarkably responsive. Roosevelt’s primary objective was to get Stalin to agree to abrogate his nonaggression pact with Japan, due to expire in 1946, and attack Japan’s Kwantung army in Manchuria. The Chinese had demonstrated their inability to do the job, and Roosevelt did not want American lives lost on the mainland. He would call in the Red army and let the Chinese pay the piper. Stalin agreed, with the understanding that the Soviet Union would be allowed a sphere of influence in Manchuria. Next, Roosevelt sought assurances that the Soviet Union would join the United Nations, without sixteen votes. Stalin settled for three. Finally, Roosevelt wanted Stalin to set aside the puppet government he had established for Poland and respect the principle of self-determination. Stalin would not dismiss the “Lublin” government, composed primarily of Communists long absent from Poland and Communist sympathizers, but he offered to prettify it by giving more posts to non-Communists, and he presented vague assurances about democracy and free elections in Eastern Europe generally. Roosevelt accepted. No agreement was reached on Germany, although the United States and Great Britain accepted the Soviet demand for extracting $10 billion in reparations as a basis for negotiations. Afterward, Churchill praised Stalin’s loyalty and cooperativeness effusively before the British Parliament. There seemed to be no issues to divide the Big Three. The war was going well, thanks to Stalin’s agreement to launch his spring offensive in February, rescuing British and American soldiers savaged by Hitler’s Ardennes offensive, and peace seemed well in hand. But Roosevelt lived long enough to see his hopes for Big Three postwar cooperation begin to unravel.","['April 1945', 'the eve', 'February 1945', 'the weeks', '1946', 'February']",franklin d. roosevelt time president united state die april 1945 eve victory europe death yalta february 1945 week follow try desperately secure endure peace labor valiantly yalta discussion churchill stalin go roosevelt find ally leader frank reasonable demand requirement remarkably responsive roosevelt ’s primary objective stalin agree abrogate nonaggression pact japan expire 1946 attack japan ’s kwantung army manchuria chinese demonstrate inability job roosevelt want life lose mainland red army let chinese pay piper stalin agree understanding soviet union allow sphere influence manchuria roosevelt seek assurance soviet union join united nation sixteen vote stalin settle finally roosevelt want stalin set aside puppet government establish poland respect principle self determination stalin dismiss “ lublin ” government compose primarily communist long absent poland communist sympathizer offer prettify give post non communist present vague assurance democracy free election eastern europe generally roosevelt accept agreement reach germany united state great britain accept soviet demand extract 10 billion reparation basis negotiation afterward churchill praise stalin ’s loyalty cooperativeness effusively british parliament issue divide big war go thank stalin ’s agreement launch spring offensive february rescue british soldier savage hitler ’s ardenne offensive peace hand roosevelt live long hope big postwar cooperation begin unravel,198,"[1945, 1945, 1946]",1945,3,1950,1950
988,"Perhaps because of fatigue or the imminence of death, Roosevelt blundered seriously in March 1945. Uncharacteristically insensitive to Soviet anxieties, he authorized American intelligence operatives to meet secretly in Switzerland with senior German officers to discuss the German surrender in Italy. Stalin immediately suspected the worst: a deal between the Germans and his Anglo-American allies, a deal that would allow the Germans to concentrate their resistance against the advance of the Red army. At Munich in 1938, the British and French had tried to redirect Hitler’s demonic energies against the Soviet Union, but Stalin had outsmarted them. Very likely they were trying again, this time under the leadership of his self-proclaimed American friend. Outraged, Stalin protested without pretense of diplomatic niceties. Roosevelt in turn was offended by Stalin’s accusation, conceivably unable to imagine himself capable of such a betrayal. Stalin, clearly, was more imaginative. The incident passed, but not without abrading the thin veneer of trust that might have existed between the two men. Unquestionably, the atmosphere was less conducive to an amicable resolution of the differences that resurfaced over Poland.12","['March 1945', '1938']",fatigue imminence death roosevelt blunder seriously march 1945 uncharacteristically insensitive soviet anxiety authorize intelligence operative meet secretly switzerland senior german officer discuss german surrender italy stalin immediately suspect bad deal german anglo ally deal allow german concentrate resistance advance red army munich 1938 british french try redirect hitler ’s demonic energy soviet union stalin outsmart likely try time leadership self proclaim friend outraged stalin protest pretense diplomatic nicety roosevelt turn offend stalin ’s accusation conceivably unable imagine capable betrayal stalin clearly imaginative incident pass abrade thin veneer trust exist man unquestionably atmosphere conducive amicable resolution difference resurface poland.12,98,"[1945, 1938]",1942,2,1950,1950

Roosevelt probably had less sympathy for the Poles, who had behaved badly in the 1930s, than did Churchill, whose nation had gone to war to defend their country. Roosevelt was reluctant to allow the intransigence of non-Communist Polish leaders to jeopardize his hopes of Soviet-American cooperation. Nonetheless, he could not acquiesce in the Soviet denial of any semblance of self-determination to the Poles. It would be wrong, opponents of his conception of America’s role in the new world order would exploit the issue against him, and the American people would be angered. Roosevelt’s last days were roiled by the disagreeable task of trying to redefine the concessions he had offered Stalin at Yalta – a redefinition that Stalin could hardly see as less than a reversal of American willingness to grant the Soviet Union a sphere of influence in Eastern Europe and the assurance of a friendly government in Poland.","['the 1930s', 'last days']",report poland underscore cable churchill indicate soviet control inflict country subtlety machine politician roosevelt expect stalin emulate opposition soviet impose communist dominate regime suppress ruthlessly blatantly roosevelt probably sympathy pole behave badly 1930 churchill nation go war defend country roosevelt reluctant allow intransigence non communist polish leader jeopardize hope soviet cooperation nonetheless acquiesce soviet denial semblance self determination pole wrong opponent conception america ’s role new world order exploit issue people anger roosevelt ’s day roil disagreeable task try redefine concession offer stalin yalta – redefinition stalin hardly reversal willingness grant soviet union sphere influence eastern europe assurance friendly government poland,101,[1930],1930,1,1950,1950

He had never doubted that the United States would emerge from the war as the world’s leading power. Now that power would be enough to finish the war alone, if necessary, and to maintain the peace alone, should that prove necessary. The atom bomb ensured imminent victory in East Asia and seemed likely to gain the United States additional leverage in postwar international politics.

Much as the United States might have been the envy of the rest of the world, it was a nation riddled with grave problems that would have to be faced when the euphoria of victory passed.

Millions of Americans had lost their homes, watched their children go hungry. Yes, Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal welfare programs, resisted bitterly by most wealthy Americans, had alleviated the suffering, but it was the war that revitalized the economy and brought full employment. Now the war was over, and the millions of men and women who had fought for their country would come back – and would be looking for work.

Most immediate was the need for troops to occupy Germany and Japan and funds to maintain them and the civilian-military administrations that would oversee the pacification and rectification of the people of those countries. Contingency plans for the next war had to be developed and steps taken while American power was supreme to secure the bases and other assets that would make America invincible. The newly empowered military establishment wanted funds to preserve the massive forces the United States had assembled in the course of the war, forces that could now be used to deter would-be aggressors. Civilians involved in implementing the Bretton Woods agreements and working toward the international trade organization and other instruments of the new liberal international economic order could see that reconstruction aid was not going to be sufficient.

995,"The struggle over the parameters of the welfare state, over how America’s wealth would be distributed, reemerged at war’s end. Labor unions, their activities protected by the Roosevelt administration in the 1930s, generally had accepted his demand for restraint during the war. Some, like the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), were more eager to take on corporate America than ever. All were determined to improve the lot of workers, to obtain a fair share of the profits. The country was hit hard by strikes in the last months of 1945, and labor tensions continued to run high. Many employers, eager to exploit a presumed surplus of workers, were determined to reverse some of Roosevelt’s prolabor reforms, to break the new power of the unions. Political analysts wondered whether Truman could hold the New Deal coalition together, whether the United States could escape intensification of class conflict.","['the 1930s', 'the last months of 1945']",struggle parameter welfare state america ’s wealth distribute reemerg war ’s end labor union activity protect roosevelt administration 1930 generally accept demand restraint war like congress industrial organization cio eager corporate america determine improve lot worker obtain fair share profit country hit hard strike month 1945 labor tension continue run high employer eager exploit presume surplus worker determine reverse roosevelt ’s prolabor reform break new power union political analyst wonder truman hold new deal coalition united state escape intensification class conflict,81,"[1930, 1945]",1938,2,1950,1950

With little available for them to purchase during the war, American consumers were eager to spend their savings. It was quickly evident that for the immediate future, before European and Japanese industry was rebuilt, there would be no shortage of overseas markets for American goods, few nations that could compete with the United States for the control of needed raw materials. As in the 1920s, the domestic market flourished and American exports flooded out of the country. Trade and currency agreements engineered by Cordell Hull and Henry Morgenthau facilitated the efforts of American business executives to seize the unusual opportunities of the first months after the war. Increased production and increased profits allowed for more jobs at increased wages, without class warfare. The pattern could not last forever: Sooner or later, without anything to sell to the United States, foreign buyers would run out of dollars with which to buy American goods. If and when that problem was solved, the industries of prewar competitors would eventually be restored and the struggle for markets, even the domestic American market, would resume.

Americans could not understand why the Soviets did not accept the benign preeminence of the United States. The Soviets, accustomed to being treated as equals by Roosevelt, were troubled by Truman’s apparent disdain. Cultural differences aggravated the mutual irritation. The loss of the common enemy left both sides free to remember past differences and allowed the luxury of recalling earlier, ideologically tainted perceptions. A deep undercurrent of anticommunism in the United States survived wartime cooperation, as did Soviet apprehension about British and American intentions. Certainly the Soviets could never feel secure so long as the United States retained its monopoly of nuclear weapons. After the success of the July 1945 American atomic bomb test, Soviet elites feared the balance of power had been altered to their detriment, threatening loss of the security gained by victory over Germany.

Hurley, American ambassador to China, resigned in frustration over his inability to mediate successfully between Chiang’s government and the rebellious Communist forces of Mao Zedong. Hurley publicly spread blame for his failure among imperialists, Communists, and foreign service officers. For domestic political reasons, Truman’s aides deemed it essential that the president respond. The nature of the response was shaped by their interest in determining the Soviet role in China. There had been ambiguous indications of Soviet assistance to Chinese Communist forces in Manchuria, and there was some fear that the Soviet presence in Manchuria might extend beyond the spheres agreed to at Yalta, to which Chiang had acceded in exchange for Soviet professions of support in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 1945. On the other hand, the looting of Manchuria by Soviet forces suggested they were on their way home. Truman decided to send America’s most prestigious military man, General George C. Marshall, architect of victory in the war against Germany and Japan, to China to try to avert civil war there and, more important, to determine Soviet intentions.2","['November 1945', 'August 1945']",november 1945 patrick j. hurley ambassador china resign frustration inability mediate successfully chiang ’s government rebellious communist force mao zedong hurley publicly spread blame failure imperialist communist foreign service officer domestic political reason truman ’s aide deem essential president respond nature response shape interest determine soviet role china ambiguous indication soviet assistance chinese communist force manchuria fear soviet presence manchuria extend sphere agree yalta chiang accede exchange soviet profession support sino soviet treaty august 1945 hand looting manchuria soviet force suggest way home truman decide send america ’s prestigious military man general george c. marshall architect victory war germany japan china try avert civil war important determine soviet intentions.2,109,"[1945, 1945]",1945,2,1950,1950

Sometimes unilaterally, sometimes together, they groped toward some means of creating order and providing for their security and that of their friends in an anarchic world. Peoples over whom neither had much if any control struggled in pursuit of their own interests all over the globe. In Washington and in Moscow, men with little comprehension of other people’s cultures and history tried to make decisions for the world. The Soviet experience provided that nation with no basis for trust in the outside forces that had tried to isolate and destroy the regime throughout its history. American repugnance toward the terror Stalin had inflicted on his own people, toward the totalitarian dictatorship he had consolidated at home and now extended into Eastern Europe, hampered cooperation after Hitler’s defeat. What was extraordinary was the effort of each side, however warily, to ease the apprehensions of the other, to overcome the legacy of mistrust, to combine forces to keep the Germans and the Japanese down, and to create a peace that would endure. And they kept at it to the end of 1945 and on into 1946, with Stalin recognizing the absurdity of a gratuitous affront to the overwhelming power of the United States, and Truman still persuaded he and Stalin could resolve any differences that emerged. A poll taken in December 1945 showed that an overwhelming majority of Americans were pleased with Truman’s handling of foreign relations.3","['the end of 1945', '1946', 'December 1945']",question united state soviet union emerge war world ’s dominant power unilaterally grope mean create order provide security friend anarchic world people control struggle pursuit interest globe washington moscow man little comprehension people ’s culture history try decision world soviet experience provide nation basis trust outside force try isolate destroy regime history repugnance terror stalin inflict people totalitarian dictatorship consolidate home extend eastern europe hamper cooperation hitler ’s defeat extraordinary effort warily ease apprehension overcome legacy mistrust combine force german japanese create peace endure keep end 1945 1946 stalin recognize absurdity gratuitous affront overwhelming power united state truman persuade stalin resolve difference emerge poll take december 1945 show overwhelming majority american pleased truman ’s handling foreign relations.3,117,"[1945, 1946, 1945]",1945,3,1950,1950

In 1946, however, attitudes in Washington shifted significantly. Soviet actions throughout 1946 forced Truman and his advisers to reevaluate Soviet intentions, to reconsider their assumptions about the possibility of Soviet-American cooperation. Some of these Soviet actions and the American perceptions of them were classic demonstrations of what political scientists call the “security dilemma,” where an increase in one state’s security will automatically and inadvertently decrease that of another. Stalin was determined to demonstrate that he would not be intimidated by American nuclear weapons. On the basis of their historic experience of Western hostility and confronted by superior American power, the benign use of which could not be assured, Stalin and other Soviet leaders took a series of actions designed to enhance their national security. But each step they took to add to their security was viewed by American leaders as detracting from the security of the United States. Eventually, the United States responded with policies to enhance its security – which the Soviets saw imperiling their own.

A poll in December 1945 indicated that although hardly more than a third of Americans expected another major war in the next quarter of a century, those that did were most likely to name the Soviet Union as the nation that would start it.5 In February 1946, Stalin, speaking in the context of elections to the Supreme Soviet, stressed the need for ideological purity, a new five-year plan, and new sacrifices in a world in which communism struggled for survival while the contradictions among capitalists threatened the peace.

1002,"Most Americans, however, and their president, were still not ready to surrender hope of Soviet-American cooperation. In March, Churchill, now out of office, visited the United States and, in Fulton, Missouri, with Truman at his side, denounced the “Iron Curtain” he alleged the Soviets had drawn across Europe, separating the areas they controlled from the rest of the continent. His clarion call, warning America against the Soviet threat, resonated with those already of his persuasion but attracted few converts. Cynics suspected a connection between the dangers he evoked and the British loan bill, which was endangered in Congress. Many journalists and some in Congress feared Churchill was stirring fears in the United States designed to stimulate Americans to save the British Empire yet again. Cautiously, Truman disassociated himself from the speech. Although there was growing unhappiness with Truman’s management of foreign affairs and increasing irritation with Soviet behavior, as late as September 1946 only 8 percent of Americans polled were willing to give up on accommodation with Moscow and 74 percent thought both countries were responsible for the misunderstandings that seemed to have developed between the United States and the Soviet Union.6","['March', 'as late as September 1946']",american president ready surrender hope soviet cooperation march churchill office visit united state fulton missouri truman denounce “ iron curtain allege soviet draw europe separate area control rest continent clarion warn america soviet threat resonate persuasion attract convert cynic suspect connection danger evoke british loan bill endanger congress journalist congress fear churchill stir fear united state design stimulate american save british empire cautiously truman disassociate speech grow unhappiness truman ’s management foreign affair increase irritation soviet behavior late september 1946 8 percent american poll willing accommodation moscow 74 percent think country responsible misunderstanding develop united state soviet union.6,98,[1946],1946,1,1950,1950
1003,"The serious differences developing between Moscow and Washington were inescapable. American behavior in Germany troubled, perhaps even frightened, the Soviets. In January 1946, Christian Democrats, unfriendly to the Soviet Union, unhappy with Soviet compensation of Polish losses with German territory, won elections in the American zone of Germany – and subsequently in the British and French zones. A few months later, the American proconsul in Germany, Lucius Clay, decided to withhold further reparations from the American zone. In July, the Americans began a program of amnesty for ex-Nazis. Soviet informants had long been aware that American agents were protecting Nazi civilians and military personnel who were considered to be scientific or intelligence assets – as were the Soviets. In September, James Byrnes, the American secretary of state, announced in Stuttgart a new, more lenient American policy toward Germany, an action that suggested that Washington was more concerned about the well-being of its erstwhile German enemies than about Soviet needs. Finally, in December, the Americans and their British friends merged their occupation zones, with offers to the French and Soviets to join them. In due course the French did. The Soviets could hardly be expected to surrender that fragment of Germany they could still exploit, any more than they could consider as serious Byrnes’s April offer to demilitarize Germany. Twice in Stalin’s lifetime the Germans had wrought enormous suffering on Mother Russia. Preventing a resurgence of German power was the highest priority of Soviet policy. American moves to rebuild Germany, to exonerate fascists, to encourage German revanchism were not to be taken lightly.","['January 1946', '–', 'A few months later', 'July', 'September', 'December', 'April']",difference develop moscow washington inescapable behavior germany troubled frightened soviet january 1946 christian democrat unfriendly soviet union unhappy soviet compensation polish loss german territory win election zone germany – subsequently british french zone month later proconsul germany lucius clay decide withhold reparation zone july american begin program amnesty ex nazi soviet informant long aware agent protect nazi civilian military personnel consider scientific intelligence asset – soviet september james byrnes secretary state announce stuttgart new lenient policy germany action suggest washington concerned erstwhile german enemy soviet need finally december american british friend merge occupation zone offer french soviet join course french soviet hardly expect surrender fragment germany exploit consider byrne ’s april offer demilitarize germany twice stalin ’s lifetime germans work enormous suffering mother russia prevent resurgence german power high priority soviet policy move rebuild germany exonerate fascist encourage german revanchism take lightly,142,[1946],1946,1,1950,1950

In none of these countries could American leaders conceive of a threat to Soviet security, of any justifiable reason for Soviet behavior.

They had agreed to withdraw their forces after the war. The Americans and the British had withdrawn. The Soviets had stayed and were clearly scheming to separate an oil-rich province from the rest of Iran and to join it and its residents to their ethnic compatriots in the Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan.

1006,"The matter of international control of atomic energy, of nuclear weapons, also served to undermine the ability of the two nations to cooperate. Truman and his aides knew that the Soviet Union would eventually develop nuclear power. Some thought it wisest to share the secret of the bomb as a demonstration of goodwill, to win Soviet confidence in American intentions. Others, less inclined to the grand gesture, nonetheless thought international control of weapons, international oversight of the uses of nuclear power, was feasible and could be managed without risk to the security of the United States. A number of proposals surfaced within the administration, most notably one with the imprimatur of Dean Acheson of the U.S. Department of State and David Lilienthal, chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, who worked with a group of scientific consultants, led by J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had directed the effort to build the bomb. The Acheson-Lilienthal report provided for the destruction of existing nuclear weapons once UN control had been established. UN control, and the inspection that entailed, would preclude research on weapon development, conceivably leaving the United States as the only nation with that capability. Before the United Nations had an opportunity to consider the plan, it was modified by presidential adviser Bernard Baruch to include sanctions not subject to the veto, leaving the security of the Soviet Union at the mercy of a United Nations easily dominated by the United States and its friends.

In February 1946, from Moscow, he sent a long reflective cable, which made the rounds of Washington. He described the Soviet leaders as driven by the needs of the political system they had created and their own insecurities to expand their influence and power as far as other nations would permit. He warned that Stalin and his associates would interpret generosity and bluster as weakness and responded only to firmness, to clear signs that their actions would not be tolerated. The United States had to draw the line, stand firmly and patiently behind it, and wait until the Soviet system collapsed of its own weight and its inability to expand. His “long telegram” was welcomed by a number of American leaders who were in the process of formulating similar analyses of Soviet behavior and the appropriate American response.

And the election results of November 1946, sweeping the Republicans back into control of Congress for the first time since 1930, suggested he was losing control of that small part of the world that had been his.

Marshall brought Kennan back from Moscow to head a newly created policy planning staff. He had Acheson in the first months and then Robert Lovett as undersecretary. It was, arguably, the strongest leadership the department had ever had, and it used its resources well. Quickly, it fashioned a coherent set of policies and persuaded first the president, then the Congress, and finally the public to support those policies. As implemented, the policies developed by the Truman administration from 1947 to 1949 were hardly without flaws, but they constituted a sound, measured, manageable set of steps toward preserving the interests of the United States and those who shared its economic and political values. They provided the foundation for an extraordinary level of material prosperity for all who accepted American hegemony for the next two decades. These policies were unquestionably designed first and foremost to serve American interests, but they were designed by men and women who understood that those interests would not be well served by efforts to maximize economic or political advantage.

Acheson and others of Truman’s aides shared a similar belief in the need to shock Congress and the American public into recognition of an external threat worthy of their attention and their money. In the American political system, presidential mastery over Congress is often limited, especially when it is controlled by the opposition. Legislators have their own agendas and are generally more responsive, certainly in peacetime, to the demands of domestic special-interest groups than to the foreign-affairs concerns of the executive. In wartime it is relatively easy to focus congressional attention on foreign policy, relatively easy for the executive to get what it wants. The tactics applied by the Truman administration in 1947 were designed to create an atmosphere, in Washington at least, in the country as a whole if necessary, that would enable the executive to dominate the legislative agenda much as it would in time of war. If misleading Congress and the people about the nature and immediacy of the Soviet threat to American interests was necessary to gain congressional and public support, it seemed a small price to pay.

On the other hand, given the resistance the Truman administration had encountered obtaining $400 million for aid to Greece and Turkey, it is difficult to conceive of the Eightieth Congress appropriating billions of dollars for foreign aid without some sense of the need to head off impending doom. In fact, even after the Soviets withdrew and denounced the plan, Congress appeared recalcitrant. Conservatives like Senator Robert Taft (R.-Ohio), hostile to the New Deal at home, were not eager to subsidize efforts to extend it abroad. Others had never liked the commitment to tariff reduction implicit in this new economic order. Still others, liberals as well as conservatives, were reluctant to send American tax dollars overseas. Liberals could find needy Americans; conservatives preferred to spend the money on defense – or to deny the government the tax revenues.

1016,"Throughout the fall of 1947, on into the winter, into 1948, the Communist parties of Western Europe, under orders from Moscow, fought hard to prevent implementation of the Marshall Plan. The local economies were shaken, as were the governments the Communists attempted to bring down with general strikes. There were many indications that Stalin’s strategy had changed, and there was less ambiguity in Soviet actions. Moscow created the Cominform, an organization designed to coordinate Communist activities around the world, an attempt to give substance to the myth of a monolithic international Communist movement. Soviet control over Eastern Europe increased. Stalin had not seemed markedly disturbed by earlier evidence of American displeasure. His most interesting reaction to the Truman Doctrine, which some scholars have seen as a declaration of cold war against the Soviet Union, was to assure Marshall only a few days later that all differences could still be compromised. But the Marshall Plan, especially the indications of American intent to rebuild Germany and incorporate it into an anti-Soviet bloc, set off alarms in Moscow. It was another classic illustration of the security dilemma at work. The Americans and their Western European friends were preparing what they perceived as defensive action to preserve their security against a potential threat from the Soviet Union. That action diminished what little sense of security the Soviets enjoyed. The Soviets responded quickly to the threat from the West, tightening their grip on what they had, but every step they took was perceived by the United States as threatening its security and that of its friends. As the United States and the Soviet Union moved along the spectrum from allies to adversaries, each lessened the security of the other by seeking to enhance its own.","['the fall of 1947', 'the winter', '1948', 'only a few days later']",fall 1947 winter 1948 communist party western europe order moscow fight hard prevent implementation marshall plan local economy shake government communist attempt bring general strike indication stalin ’s strategy change ambiguity soviet action moscow create cominform organization design coordinate communist activity world attempt substance myth monolithic international communist movement soviet control eastern europe increase stalin markedly disturb early evidence displeasure interesting reaction truman doctrine scholar see declaration cold war soviet union assure marshall day later difference compromise marshall plan especially indication intent rebuild germany incorporate anti soviet bloc set alarm moscow classic illustration security dilemma work american western european friend prepare perceive defensive action preserve security potential threat soviet union action diminish little sense security soviet enjoy soviet respond quickly threat west tighten grip step take perceive united state threaten security friend united state soviet union move spectrum ally adversary lessen security seek enhance,144,"[1947, 1948]",1948,2,1950,1950
1017,"On February 25, 1948, the Czech Communists, already dominant, staged a coup, punctuated by the unexplained death of the pro-Western foreign minister, Jan Masaryk, on March 10, assuring the Soviets of complete control over the country. In Washington, American leaders wondered if a major Soviet move was in the offing, if war might be imminent. The recently formed Central Intelligence Agency would only assure the president that war would not come in the next sixty days. The American military deliberately heightened anxieties in an effort to extort an increase in congressional appropriations. At the request of the Pentagon, General Clay reported from Germany that war could come with “dramatic suddenness.” Ignoring Marshall’s advice to the contrary, on March 17, Truman shrewdly used the war scare to ask Congress to fund the Marshall Plan. In the same message he asked for restoration of the draft and additional funds for defense spending, and for universal military training, stressing the threat posed by Soviet ruthlessness in Czechoslovakia. Congress gave him much of what he wanted. Stalin’s “defensive” actions had facilitated passage of the program he dreaded. American economic power would unite the West against him – and this time the West included most of Germany.19","['February 25, 1948', 'March 10', 'the next sixty days', 'March 17', '–']",february 25 1948 czech communist dominant stag coup punctuate unexplained death pro western foreign minister jan masaryk march 10 assure soviet complete control country washington leader wonder major soviet offing war imminent recently form central intelligence agency assure president war come day military deliberately heighten anxiety effort extort increase congressional appropriation request pentagon general clay report germany war come “ dramatic suddenness ” ignore marshall ’s advice contrary march 17 truman shrewdly war scare ask congress fund marshall plan message ask restoration draft additional fund defense spending universal military training stress threat pose soviet ruthlessness czechoslovakia congress give want stalin ’ “ defensive ” action facilitate passage program dread economic power unite west – time west include germany.19,118,[1948],1948,1,1950,1950
1018,"Tension increased significantly in June 1948. The Russians were unquestionably troubled by conditions in Germany – unification of the western zones, the end of denazification, and the decisions to rebuild German industrial power, create a strong West German state, and integrate it with Western Europe. Although the Soviets had provoked some of these developments, they had every reason to fear them and to attempt to reverse the process whereby a powerful Germany might rise to threaten them again. Stalin moved cautiously, harassing traffic between the western occupation zones and Berlin, part of which, although in the Soviet zone, was nonetheless under British, French, and American jurisdiction. On June 24, however, the Soviets stopped all traffic to West Berlin. General Clay called for action to force the blockade, for an ultimatum and an armed convoy to call the Soviet bluff. War seemed possible.","['June 1948', 'June 24']",tension increase significantly june 1948 russian unquestionably trouble condition germany – unification western zone end denazification decision rebuild german industrial power create strong west german state integrate western europe soviet provoke development reason fear attempt reverse process powerful germany rise threaten stalin move cautiously harass traffic western occupation zone berlin soviet zone nonetheless british french jurisdiction june 24 soviet stop traffic west berlin general clay call action force blockade ultimatum armed convoy soviet bluff war possible,76,[1948],1948,1,1950,1950
1019,"In Washington, Truman and his advisers, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, rejected Clay’s recommendation. They did not want to start a war. The military was not ready to fight one. But they could not acquiesce in the Soviet effort to deny access to Berlin, to cut off the millions of Berliners from the West. Politically, the president could not appear weak. Public opinion polls already indicated that the American people thought his policies toward the Soviet Union “soft,” and 1948 was an election year. Equally important was the need to demonstrate American resolve to the Soviets and the people of Western Europe. Eventually, the United States responded with an airlift, carrying food and coal in extraordinary quantities to the people of Berlin. Day after day, week after week, month after month, another huge cargo plane landed every few minutes. The operation was a costly but impressive success. Soviet planes occasionally harried the transport planes, but never threatened. Stalin was no more ready for war than Truman.","['1948', 'an election year', 'Day', 'day, week', 'week, month', 'month']",washington truman adviser include joint chief staff reject clay ’s recommendation want start war military ready fight acquiesce soviet effort deny access berlin cut million berliner west politically president appear weak public opinion poll indicate people think policy soviet union “ soft ” 1948 election year equally important need demonstrate resolve soviet people western europe eventually united state respond airlift carry food coal extraordinary quantity people berlin day day week week month month huge cargo plane land minute operation costly impressive success soviet plane occasionally harry transport plane threaten stalin ready war truman,93,[1948],1948,1,1950,1950
1020,"In May 1949, the Soviets admitted defeat and the blockade was lifted. With relative caution, Stalin had tried to prevent the creation of a potentially powerful and threatening German state – the most threatening step the United States had taken since the end of the war. He failed, but the confrontation over Berlin changed the nature of the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. American reproaches over Eastern European, especially Polish, affairs, had been irritating, but Stalin had brushed the Americans aside, thrown them an occasional bone, surrendered nothing of substance. Truman’s prattle over Greece was also bothersome. Control of Greece would have been welcome, but the Soviet Union had long since conceded Greece to the West. It was Tito, not Stalin, who was engaged there. Unfriendly American gestures regarding Soviet interests in Iran and Turkey rankled more, but in due course, as Soviet power relative to the United States increased, there would be opportunity to bring about more satisfactory results. The rebuilding of Germany, however, the integrating of a German state in an American-led coalition against the Soviet Union, was frightening. The Germans had defeated Russia in World War I. They had wreaked enormous havoc on the Soviet nation, coming within a hair of defeating it in World War II. With the Americans behind them, vengeful Germans could erase all of Stalin’s gains since 1945 and once again bring misery to the Soviet people. American actions had to be perceived as hostile, and the Soviet Union responded accordingly, using all means short of war to persuade the Americans to back off – and failed. Unable to contest American power, the Soviet Union was forced to accept the division of Germany and of Europe on American terms.","['May 1949', 'the end of the', '1945', '–']",1949 soviet admit defeat blockade lift relative caution stalin try prevent creation potentially powerful threaten german state – threatening step united state take end war fail confrontation berlin change nature relationship united state soviet union reproach eastern european especially polish affair irritating stalin brush american aside throw occasional bone surrender substance truman ’s prattle greece bothersome control greece welcome soviet union long concede greece west tito stalin engage unfriendly gesture soviet interest iran turkey rankle course soviet power relative united state increase opportunity bring satisfactory result rebuilding germany integrating german state lead coalition soviet union frightening germans defeat russia world war i. wreak enormous havoc soviet nation come hair defeat world war ii american vengeful german erase stalin ’s gain 1945 bring misery soviet people action perceive hostile soviet union respond accordingly mean short war persuade american – fail unable contest power soviet union force accept division germany europe term,150,"[1949, 1945]",1947,2,1950,1950
1021,"By the end of 1948, the United States and the Soviet Union were obviously no longer allies or friends. Certainly they were adversaries, but perhaps they were not quite enemies. Lippmann’s term, “Cold War,” seemed apt. Both nations had ended their processes of demobilization and had begun military preparedness programs, including planning for war against each other. Yet even the Berlin blockade, unsettling as it was, had been handled cautiously by both nations. They left each other room to retreat and they managed the crisis without bloodshed. The division of Germany, which both Moscow and Washington considered essential, had been achieved. There were no remaining issues. The world reflected an uneasy balance, superficially bipolar, in which preponderant American power, including sole possession of nuclear weapons, assured the security of the United States and its friends. The United States might have used its power to roll back Soviet gains; it might have been able to topple the Communist regime in Moscow. Clearly it was unwilling to pay the price, and there is little to indicate that Stalin apprehended an American attack. With Europe divided tolerably, without any vital interests in conflict, the two greatest powers might have focused their energies on their considerable internal problems.

1022,"The next step was the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), derived from European initiatives early in 1948. The recipients of Marshall Plan aid were delighted by American generosity but feared economic assistance would not be enough to contain what they perceived as a political threat from the Soviet Union and the Cominform. Far across the Atlantic, thousands of miles from the nearest Soviet tank, hardly aware of their infinitesimally tiny, pathetically powerless Communist party, Americans in Washington might feel secure. Europeans did not. In March 1948, Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg joined forces in the Brussels Pact, aimed at protecting themselves from the Soviets and, if necessary, from a resurgent Germany as well. They hoped the United States would join their alliance, knowing full well that American power was essential to their security.","['1948', 'March 1948']",step creation north atlantic treaty organization nato derive european initiative early 1948 recipient marshall plan aid delight generosity fear economic assistance contain perceive political threat soviet union cominform far atlantic thousand mile near soviet tank hardly aware infinitesimally tiny pathetically powerless communist party american washington feel secure europeans march 1948 great britain france belgium netherland luxembourg join force brussels pact aim protect soviet necessary resurgent germany hop united state join alliance know power essential security,75,"[1948, 1948]",1948,2,1950,1950
1023,"A peacetime military alliance with European states was unprecedented and not very appealing to American leaders (although they had signed a mutual defense pact with Latin American countries in 1947). Obviously, the Americans were displeased by Soviet behavior on the Soviet periphery, irritated by Soviet-style diplomacy, and disappointed by the lack of Soviet deference toward the world’s greatest power, but through 1947, on into early 1948, they perceived no military threat from the Soviet Union, little likelihood of war in Europe or elsewhere. They saw no problems that economic assistance, American dollars, could not alleviate; nothing that required so radical a step as a peacetime alliance – a step that might outrage many members of the Eightieth Congress.","['1947', '1947', 'early 1948']",peacetime military alliance european state unprecedented appealing leader sign mutual defense pact latin country 1947 obviously american displease soviet behavior soviet periphery irritated soviet style diplomacy disappoint lack soviet deference world ’s great power 1947 early 1948 perceive military threat soviet union little likelihood war europe see problem economic assistance dollar alleviate require radical step peacetime alliance – step outrage member eightieth congress,63,"[1947, 1947, 1948]",1947,3,1950,1950
1024,"The coup in Czechoslovakia, followed by fears of a similar coup in Italy and Norwegian complaints of Soviet pressures, carried the day for those Americans who advocated a mutual security arrangement with European friends. Reluctantly, the U.S. military, ever fearful of overcommitment, of having to share supplies and secrets with Europeans, allowed itself to be dragged along. The Berlin blockade provided another needed stimulus, although the U.S. government held out for provisions that would reshape the ultimate organization more to its liking. Washington insisted, for example, on membership for Denmark, Iceland, Italy, Norway, and Portugal, diluting the influence of the original signatories. The politics of the 1948 American election campaign precluded consummation of an agreement before 1949. The treaty establishing NATO was finally signed in Washington in April 1949. At least on paper, Western European leaders had the assurance they desired of American political and military support.21","['the day', '1948', '1949', 'April 1949']",coup czechoslovakia follow fear similar coup italy norwegian complaint soviet pressure carry day american advocate mutual security arrangement european friend reluctantly u.s military fearful overcommitment have share supply secret europeans allow drag berlin blockade provide need stimulus u.s government hold provision reshape ultimate organization liking washington insist example membership denmark iceland italy norway portugal dilute influence original signatory politic 1948 election campaign preclude consummation agreement 1949 treaty establish nato finally sign washington april 1949 paper western european leader assurance desire political military support.21,83,"[1948, 1949, 1949]",1949,3,1950,1950

The American campaign to block a Communist victory in the April 1948 Italian elections had succeeded. The airlift had succeeded. The Norwegians were less apprehensive. Tito had split with Stalin and survived. If there had been a Soviet offensive, it appeared to have subsided. Moscow was clearly on the defensive. Stalin and his diplomatists were telling everyone who would listen of their urgent desire for peace. Conceivably, NATO would prove to be unnecessary, a response to a danger that had evaporated. Confronted with evidence of American resolve, comfortable with what they had already gained in Eastern and Central Europe, unwilling to pay the price of further expansion, the Soviets were ready to accept the status quo and exist in peaceful competition with the West, ending the tension before it brought the world any closer to the brink of war.","['the closing months of 1948', 'early 1949', 'April 1948']",diminished sense urgency washington closing month 1948 early 1949 nato negotiation strike campaign block communist victory april 1948 italian election succeed airlift succeed norwegian apprehensive tito split stalin survive soviet offensive appear subside moscow clearly defensive stalin diplomatist tell listen urgent desire peace conceivably nato prove unnecessary response danger evaporate confront evidence resolve comfortable gain eastern central europe unwilling pay price expansion soviet ready accept status quo exist peaceful competition west end tension bring world closer brink war,78,"[1948, 1949, 1948]",1948,3,1950,1950

But in 1949, the United States and the Soviet Union had gained four years of experience in coping with each other, had managed their differences without bloodshed. Stalin clearly recognized the preponderance of American power, had a sense of its utility, and apprehended the circumstances in which it was likely to be used. Truman and his aides had drawn the line and forced Stalin to toe it. Again, there was a promise of respite, of time for each state to serve its people.

Truman’s surprise victory meant that at least four more years, a total of twenty years, would pass without a Republican in the White House – and he brought a Democratic majority in the Congress back to Washington with him. Rank-and-file Republican politicians were angered by the absence of power and patronage for which American political parties exist. They pressed their leaders for radical changes in strategy, for an end to bipartisanship in foreign policy, for an end to what they considered “me-tooism.” They demanded and orchestrated a savage attack on the policies of the Truman administration. Criticism of Truman for being “soft on communism” was difficult to substantiate in face of the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the Berlin airlift, and the NATO alliance, but the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek’s regime in China provided an opportunity antiadministration forces did not waste.","['1948', 'at least four more years', 'twenty years', '–']",election 1948 relieve tension society truman ’s surprise victory mean year total year pass republican white house – bring democratic majority congress washington rank file republican politician anger absence power patronage political party exist press leader radical change strategy end bipartisanship foreign policy end consider “ tooism ” demand orchestrate savage attack policy truman administration criticism truman “ soft communism ” difficult substantiate face truman doctrine marshall plan berlin airlift nato alliance collapse chiang kai shek ’s regime china provide opportunity antiadministration force waste,84,[1948],1948,1,1950,1950

Chiang dissipated the material assistance with which the United States provided him, the enormous manpower and firepower advantages with which he had begun the war, and was on the verge of total defeat at the hands of the Chinese Communists as Acheson took office as secretary of state in January 1949. Desperately, Chiang and his American friends begged the United States to redress the balance in China, to rescue Chiang’s regime. Had Marshall or Acheson been able to conceive of a way to prevent the Communist victory in China, they doubtless would have done so, but their advisers warned that the task was impossible, the cost in lives and treasure more than the United States could bear. American strategists had a low regard for China’s importance relative to Europe, the Middle East, and Japan. Marshall, the architect of America’s Europe-first strategy in World War II, and Acheson, the consummate Atlanticist, saw no reason to question their advisers. The fall of China to the Chinese Communists was undesirable and unfortunate, but it was not catastrophic. China was a weak country, likely to remain so for the foreseeable future, and more likely a burden than an asset to the Soviet Union. In due course the Chinese Communists, like Tito and Yugoslavia, would assert their independence of Moscow.

Anti–New Deal forces had won an important victory over organized labor in 1947 with passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, significantly weakening unions, over Truman’s veto. The Senate consistently blocked Truman’s modest efforts to prevent discrimination against blacks in the job market. Self-styled conservatives identified the New Deal – one of those occasional efforts in American history to provide a minimal level of decency for less fortunate citizens, to protect them from the miseries that accompany the business cycle in a market economy – with communism. Support for workers, for minorities, for health insurance, even for Social Security, was labeled Communist agitation. In the 1930s, capitalism had been a dirty word in the United States, as Americans held capitalists responsible for the Great Depression. Now some of those elements in the society who had lost status in the 1930s were on the offensive.

He could be associated with the New Deal social and economic reforms and the liberal internationalism that was also anathema to conservatives. Hiss seemed typical of the eastern establishment WASPs whose rule was so bitterly resented in much of the country. In 1948, Hiss was accused of having passed classified information to the Soviet Union in the late 1930s and indicted for perjury (for having denied espionage charges under oath). After a first trial ended with a hung jury in July 1949, he was convicted in January 1950, in part due to the successful efforts of Representative Richard Nixon (R.-Calif.) to turn up evidence against him. Here was proof – or so it was alleged – that New Deal Democrats had betrayed the country.

Truman had resisted strenuously efforts by the military to obtain significant budget increases.

Truman had presided over a reorganization of the American military establishment, now headed by a secretary of defense, and, in 1949, appointed to that post Louis Johnson, a man committed to holding down military spending. Acheson was less certain. Some of his advisers were troubled by the size of Soviet conventional forces, troubled by what they argued was the ability of the Soviets to march through Western Europe at will. Acheson believed in operating from a position of strength. He had little patience with men like Kennan who argued that the Soviets had no intention of marching through Europe. Acheson doubted whether anyone could determine the intent of the closed, secretive Stalinist state. The United States had to respond to the capabilities of the Soviet military.

The Soviet Union had done little to create the climate. It had contributed little to Mao’s victory in China, a fact of which the Chinese would remind Soviet leaders often. Spying was a nasty business, in which both sides unquestionably were engaged in 1949, but Hiss was charged with acts of treachery in the late 1930s. And surely the Soviets had not been expected to allow the United States the luxury of a nuclear monopoly forever. In short, the Soviets had provoked without being provocative, almost by existing. Truman and Acheson took steps designed to maintain American military superiority, but in the same month, January 1950, they rejected demands from prominent Republican leaders that they intervene in the Chinese civil war. In an important speech, Acheson declared that the Asian mainland and the island of Taiwan lay outside the defensive perimeter of the United States.","['–', '1949', 'the late 1930s', 'the same month', 'January 1950']",communist conquest china alger hiss case soviet nuclear explosion feed disparate overlapping force united states.26 man woman displease truman administration – political ideological reason genuine concern adequacy strategic posture – press change satisfied aggressive anti soviet policy soviet union little create climate contribute little mao ’s victory china fact chinese remind soviet leader spying nasty business side unquestionably engage 1949 hiss charge act treachery late 1930 surely soviet expect allow united state luxury nuclear monopoly forever short soviet provoke provocative exist truman acheson take step design maintain military superiority month january 1950 reject demand prominent republican leader intervene chinese civil war important speech acheson declare asian mainland island taiwan lie outside defensive perimeter united state,115,"[1949, 1930, 1950]",1943,3,1950,1950
1036,"In March, the new study of security policy was ready, labeled NSC-68. It was intended to justify, in no uncertain terms, a major expansion of American military forces, sufficient to ensure the continued ability of the United States to meet any threat with overwhelming force. An aggressively expansionist Soviet Union was postulated, its capabilities exaggerated, the danger estimated on a worst-case basis: If every variable were evaluated as being as favorable as possible to the Soviet Union, what would the United States need to counter the threat? The answer was a tripling of the military budget. Again, the security dilemma was obvious. The Soviets had no choice but to acquire nuclear weapons. They might reasonably perceive a threat in the Marshall Plan and the creation of NATO and arm against it. But any increment to Soviet power, any effort by the Soviets to enhance their security, was perceived by Washington to be a threat to the security of the United States. And yet Acheson was preparing to stimulate the next cycle, projecting a major “defensive” buildup by the United States, unable to imagine how his adversary might perceive such action as threatening. Perhaps fortunately, although Truman shared his premises, Acheson was unable to persuade the president to commit the required resources. The program languished, the Cold War stabilized, Stalin called for peace – and, in the early months of 1950, there seemed a chance he might get it.","['March', 'the early months of 1950']",march new study security policy ready label nsc-68 intend justify uncertain term major expansion military force sufficient ensure continue ability united state meet threat overwhelming force aggressively expansionist soviet union postulate capability exaggerate danger estimate bad case basis variable evaluate favorable possible soviet union united state need counter threat answer tripling military budget security dilemma obvious soviet choice acquire nuclear weapon reasonably perceive threat marshall plan creation nato arm increment soviet power effort soviet enhance security perceive washington threat security united state acheson prepare stimulate cycle project major “ defensive ” buildup united state unable imagine adversary perceive action threaten fortunately truman share premise acheson unable persuade president commit require resource program languish cold war stabilize stalin call peace – early month 1950 chance,124,[1950],1950,1,1975,2000

The political scientist Stephen Krasner has referred to the “paradox of external strength and internal weakness.”27 The leaders of the world’s most powerful nation were constantly constrained by domestic interest groups and the reins given to Congress by the Constitution. Roosevelt and Truman evaded those constraints in pursuit of their conceptions of the national interest. Truman and his advisers concluded that overcoming public and congressional lassitude required magnification of the Soviet threat, the Soviet role in undesirable outcomes. That exaggerated view of the Soviet threat took root, to the advantage of anti-Communist ideologues who ultimately dominated American political discourse after 1950.",['1950'],attribute political system exacerbate problem political scientist stephen krasner refer “ paradox external strength internal weakness.”27 leader world ’s powerful nation constantly constrain domestic interest group rein give congress constitution roosevelt truman evade constraint pursuit conception national interest truman adviser conclude overcome public congressional lassitude require magnification soviet threat soviet role undesirable outcome exaggerated view soviet threat take root advantage anti communist ideologue ultimately dominate political discourse 1950,68,[1950],1950,1,1975,2000

Vietnamese nationalists, the Communist-led Vietminh, were unable to attain independence peacefully and, by 1946, were engaged in a revolutionary war.

1039,"The pattern could be seen with situational variations in two countries with which the United States was more deeply involved: the Philippines and China. In 1946 the United States, demonstrating its antiimperialism in the most substantial way, granted independence to its own subjects, the Filipinos. The imperial power did not leave cleanly, however. The United States retained control of major bases in the islands and continued to manipulate local politics so that traditional elites, who had often collaborated with the Japanese as they had with the Americans before and after the war, retained control. The disintegration of the islands’ economy, suddenly bereft of colonial connections, troubled few in Washington until a leftist-led peasant revolution, the Hukbalahap, gathered force. Thereafter, the United States government was quick to provide the advice and assistance necessary to suppress it.4",['1946'],pattern see situational variation country united state deeply involved philippine china 1946 united state demonstrate antiimperialism substantial way grant independence subject filipinos imperial power leave cleanly united state retain control major base island continue manipulate local politic traditional elite collaborate japanese american war retain control disintegration islands’ economy suddenly bereft colonial connection trouble washington leftist lead peasant revolution hukbalahap gather force united state government quick provide advice assistance necessary suppress it.4,71,[1946],1946,1,1950,1950
1040,"China was a more complicated and much more important case. At war’s end, Washington was unsympathetic to Chiang’s regime, which had proved to be a difficult ally. But wartime camaraderie with Mao’s Communist rebels quickly gave way to concern for their connection to Moscow. As everywhere else, Americans would have liked to re-create China in their own image, serving their sense of mission by creating a coalition of Kuomintang and Communist “moderates” – a New Deal for China. Clearly, the United States anticipated a patron–client relationship with China, not easily achieved in dealing with obstreperous patriots like Chiang and Mao. When Marshall failed, in 1946, to prevent civil war, American leaders surrendered their hope of a China that would advance American ends. A victory for Chiang became their clear preference and they continued to provide his forces with aid, not as much as he would have liked, but more than they thought his regime was worth. His collapse in 1948 and the subsequent establishment by the Communists of the People’s Republic of China was perceived by men like Marshall, Acheson, and Kennan as unfortunate, contrary to American interests, but not a disaster. They knew Mao would be more responsive to Moscow than to Washington, but they also knew that he and those closest to him were intensely nationalistic. They assumed, as they devised policy toward China in November 1948, that Communist China could be prevented from becoming an “adjunct of Soviet power.”5","['1946', '1948', 'November 1948']",china complicated important case war ’s end washington unsympathetic chiang ’s regime prove difficult ally wartime camaraderie mao ’s communist rebel quickly give way concern connection moscow american like create china image serve sense mission create coalition kuomintang communist “ moderate – new deal china clearly united state anticipate patron – client relationship china easily achieve deal obstreperous patriot like chiang mao marshall fail 1946 prevent civil war leader surrender hope china advance end victory chiang clear preference continue provide force aid like think regime worth collapse 1948 subsequent establishment communist people ’s republic china perceive man like marshall acheson kennan unfortunate contrary interest disaster know mao responsive moscow washington know close intensely nationalistic assume devise policy china november 1948 communist china prevent “ adjunct soviet power.”5,127,"[1946, 1948, 1948]",1947,3,1950,1950
1041,"In the course of 1949, Acheson determined to abandon Chiang, who had fled to Taiwan, and to seek accommodation with the People’s Republic. The domestic political context hampered his efforts, and the activities and pronouncements of the Chinese Communists did little to facilitate his task. Most of his advisers in the Department of State, the secretary of defense and his aides, and key lawmakers of both parties opposed and sometimes obstructed Acheson’s policies. He held course, supported by a wavering president. Time, he assumed, was on his side. In due course the Communists would eliminate Chiang, and Americans would learn to live with the reality of a Communist China. Mao’s trip to Moscow in December 1949 and the resultant Sino-Soviet alliance were a clear setback, but Acheson persisted in believing that China and the Soviet Union were not natural allies. Chinese nationalism would prevent the Soviets from controlling China, and the day would come when the issues between the two countries would divide them. In January 1950, Acheson had spoken publicly of an American defensive perimeter that excluded Taiwan and had hinted that the United States would recognize Mao’s Peking government when the dust of the civil war had settled. His aides were struggling desperately to come up with a plan to save Taiwan as spring passed and summer came to Washington.

1042,"American missionaries, businessmen, and naval officers had established contacts with Korea in the nineteenth century, but the United States had little contact with that country after the Japanese established their hegemony there in 1905, at the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War. In the closing days of World War II, the United States and its Soviet allies agreed to liberate Korea jointly, dividing the areas of their responsibilities at the thirty-eighth parallel, the very point at which Japan and tsarist Russia had once divided their spheres of influence. Soviet forces reached Korea first, drove past the thirty-eighth parallel, but unhesitatingly moved north of it when American forces arrived, several weeks after the war was over. Neither the Soviets nor the Americans knew a great deal about Korea, but the Americans, thousands of miles away, doubtless knew less than the Russians, who shared a tiny border with the Koreans and had a historic interest in controlling the country.","['the nineteenth century', '1905', 'the closing days', 'several weeks']",missionary businessman naval officer establish contact korea nineteenth century united state little contact country japanese establish hegemony 1905 conclusion russo japanese war closing day world war ii united state soviet ally agree liberate korea jointly divide area responsibility thirty eighth parallel point japan tsarist russia divide sphere influence soviet force reach korea drive past thirty eighth parallel unhesitatingly move north force arrive week war soviet american know great deal korea american thousand mile away doubtless know russian share tiny border korean historic interest control country,85,[1905],1905,1,1925,1950
1043,"Korea was liberated. The Koreans demanded their independence. Neither the Americans nor the Soviets were quite sure what to do with them beyond the vague idea of establishing some kind of trusteeship until unspecified conditions for independence were met. Koreans, regardless of their politics, were outraged by the concept of trusteeship, intent upon achieving freedom immediately. As the liberating forces set about the temporary business of administering their respective sectors, the Soviets turned to local Communists and Koreans who had fought alongside Soviet forces against the Japanese. The Americans were attracted to those most familiar with the vocabulary of liberal democracy, many of whom had collaborated with the Japanese. When Soviet-American tensions developed, the thirty-eighth parallel ceased to be a temporary line dividing the operational theaters of two allied forces and hardened into something more akin to an international border in the eyes of Russians and Americans, if not Koreans. Each side trained and armed Koreans under its jurisdiction. Several years passed without agreement on reunification. Separate governments were established in 1948. Koreans on both sides refused to accept the division of their country, fought constant skirmishes at the border, and did what they could to infiltrate territory controlled by the other. Politics in the American sector were incomprehensible and unpleasant, with Syngman Rhee, a ruthless Princeton-educated autocrat – anti-Communist to be sure, but unamenable to American advice – emerging as the dominant figure. The American military wanted to go home.7","['Several years', '1948', '–']",korea liberate korean demand independence american soviet sure vague idea establish kind trusteeship unspecified condition independence meet korean regardless politic outrage concept trusteeship intent achieve freedom immediately liberating force set temporary business administer respective sector soviet turn local communist korean fight alongside soviet force japanese american attract familiar vocabulary liberal democracy collaborate japanese soviet tension develop thirty eighth parallel cease temporary line divide operational theater ally force harden akin international border eye russian american korean train armed korean jurisdiction year pass agreement reunification separate government establish 1948 korean side refuse accept division country fight constant skirmish border infiltrate territory control politic sector incomprehensible unpleasant syngman rhee ruthless princeton educate autocrat – anti communist sure unamenable advice – emerge dominant figure military want home.7,123,[1948],1948,1,1950,1950
1044,"By 1949, the Joint Chiefs were able to persuade the National Security Council to order the withdrawal of American troops from Korea. The Department of State was opposed, leery of what intelligence estimates indicated were superior Korean Communist forces, of estimates that indicated that perhaps as many as one-third of Rhee’s citizens were sympathetic to the Communists and probably many more simply hostile to Rhee. Without the presence of American forces, southern Korea likely would be overrun by the Communists and a united Communist Korea would result. The threat caused minimal concern in Washington in 1949. The president and the secretary of defense were committed to limiting the defense budget. Korea was low on nearly everyone’s list of priorities. The Asian mainland was determined to lie beyond the defensive perimeter of the United States. Troops in Korea would be useless in a war with the Soviet Union. They were needed elsewhere. Economic assistance, military advice, and supplies would have to suffice to keep the Rhee regime afloat. In Acheson’s speech in January 1950, in statements by other military and political leaders that spring, and most obviously by the earlier withdrawal of American troops, the United States had signaled its low estimate of Korea’s strategic importance in a global confrontation with the Soviets.8","['1949', '1949', 'January 1950', 'spring']",1949 joint chief able persuade national security council order withdrawal troop korea department state oppose leery intelligence estimate indicate superior korean communist force estimate indicate rhee ’s citizen sympathetic communist probably simply hostile rhee presence force southern korea likely overrun communist united communist korea result threat cause minimal concern washington 1949 president secretary defense commit limit defense budget korea low nearly ’s list priority asian mainland determine lie defensive perimeter united state troop korea useless war soviet union need economic assistance military advice supply suffice rhee regime afloat acheson ’s speech january 1950 statement military political leader spring obviously early withdrawal troop united state signal low estimate korea ’s strategic importance global confrontation soviets.8,114,"[1949, 1949, 1950]",1949,3,1950,1950

To everyone who would listen – and to many who would not – he and his agents, covert as well as overt, spoke of the need for peace, of their belief that communists and capitalists could coexist on this planet.

The alliance Mao and Stalin signed in February 1950 forced Acheson to surrender hope of a rift between the two Communist states in the immediate future. Ever the realist, Acheson still looked toward eventual recognition of the People’s Republic of China, but he was in no hurry to reward the friend of his enemy. Mao, on the other hand, was convinced that the United States was implacably hostile, that sooner or later it would attack the People’s Republic of China and try to reverse his victory. American actions following the outbreak of the war in Korea intensified his anxiety. The United States ordered warships to the Taiwan Strait to prevent Mao’s forces from invading Taiwan and mopping up the remnants of Chiang’s army there. MacArthur flew to Taipei and stood shoulder to shoulder with Chiang, indicating his support for Chiang and his view of Taiwan as an unsinkable aircraft carrier that could not be allowed to fall to the Communists.

Relying on the New York Times for their information about the United States, his advisers reported growing sentiment in favor of uniting Korea and then continuing on into China to throw the Communists out.13 China was weak. It desperately needed time and all of its resources to reconstruct and then modernize the country, parts of which had been at war since 1931. It could hardly expect to win a war against the most powerful nation the world had ever known. Chinese leaders did not want to fight, but Mao, convinced the Americans would leave him no choice, chose to fight on Korean rather than Chinese soil. Even after Stalin reneged on his offer of air support and the Chinese politburo voted against intervention, Mao was undeterred. In October, as UN forces crossed the thirty-eighth parallel and marched toward the Yalu River, which separated Korea from China, Mao ordered Chinese troops into Korea. Again and again, the Chinese sent warnings that they would attack if UN troops continued to march north.

Truman and his advisers, military and civilian, fearful of provoking Soviet intervention, rejected MacArthur’s demand for permission to attack China. American forces were expanding rapidly, but they were not yet ready for World War III. Fierce aerial assaults against overextended Chinese lines began to take an enormous toll, and gradually the Chinese were driven back across the thirty-eighth parallel. Efforts to end the war largely on the basis of prewar conditions began in earnest in the spring of 1951. Instead of the popular victory Truman might have claimed in September 1950, the administration had continued fighting to the point where the war was intensely unpopular with the American people and enormously costly in blood and treasure. It had brought upon itself a war it could not win without risking a world war for which the American military was not ready.

By the end of 1952, according to the historian Marc Trachtenberg, American military leaders thought they were ready to take on the Soviets.15 Having perceived the outbreak of war in Korea and Chinese intervention as evidence that the Soviet Union did not fear the United States, American leaders interpreted Soviet willingness to allow their Korean and Chinese surrogates to be slaughtered as evidence that the balance had shifted in favor of the United States.

Stalin unquestionably attempted to use Communists and Communist sympathizers all over the world to serve the ends of Soviet policy. Though inconsequential in number and potential for damage, Communists serving as Soviet agents unquestionably existed in the United States.

Gone were the images of weak, docile Chinese, grateful for American largesse and hungering for Christianity, democracy, and the free-enterprise system. Now hundreds of millions of Chinese were perceived as being instruments of the international Communist conspiracy, attacking Americans at Stalin’s orders. A Gallup poll indicated that only 5 percent of the American people believed the Chinese had intervened in Korea on their own initiative. Accusations that Truman and Acheson, advised by Communist sympathizers, had betrayed their loyal ally Chiang Kai-shek and “lost” China to the Communists took root, the best evidence of what McCarthy called “twenty years of treason” by the Democratic administrations of Roosevelt and Truman. Mao’s China became America’s most feared and hated enemy, the return of the yellow peril. Recognition of the Beijing regime was impossible, as was American acquiescence in seating it in the United Nations. Chiang’s critics were purged from the Department of State or assigned to obscure posts and those who tended to equate his interests with those of the United States came to dominate the Office of Chinese Affairs. In 1951, assistant secretary Dean Rusk signaled the shift in policy by denouncing Mao’s China as a gigantic “Slavic Manchukuo,” not to be recognized because it was a Soviet puppet rather than an independent Chinese state. That fiction poisoned Chinese-American relations for decades – even after China and the Soviet Union were at each other’s throats.19","['twenty years', '1951', 'decades']",major victim mccarthy korea acheson ’s policy china mao ’s red horde kill thousand american maim go image weak docile chinese grateful largesse hunger christianity democracy free enterprise system hundred million chinese perceive instrument international communist conspiracy attack american stalin ’s order gallup poll indicate 5 percent people believe chinese intervene korea initiative accusation truman acheson advise communist sympathizer betray loyal ally chiang kai shek “ lose ” china communist take root good evidence mccarthy call “ year treason ” democratic administration roosevelt truman mao ’s china america ’s fear hat enemy return yellow peril recognition beijing regime impossible acquiescence seat united nation chiang ’s critic purge department state assign obscure post tend equate interest united state come dominate office chinese affair 1951 assistant secretary dean rusk signal shift policy denounce mao ’s china gigantic “ slavic manchukuo ” recognize soviet puppet independent chinese state fiction poison chinese relation decade – china soviet union ’s throats.19,156,[1951],1951,1,1975,2000

If, as General Omar Bradley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, argued, in response to calls to attack China, it would be the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time, the right war would be against the Soviet Union when the American military buildup was completed.

Consequently fearful that American dalliance on the Asian periphery would result in neglect of Europe, British, French, and German leaders anxiously sought a larger, permanent U.S. military force on the continent. The Soviet effort to create a united Communist Korea presaged an attempt to unite the two German states under the red banner. The American government shared some of Europe’s apprehensions but wanted Europeans to contribute more to their own defense. Increasingly, the advisers in Washington thought in terms of the need to rearm Germany, of a German army that would provide critical manpower for NATO forces in Central Europe. In December 1950, formal discussions on a German contribution to the defense of Western Europe began. On the same day, as a symbol of American commitment, Dwight D. Eisenhower was named supreme commander of allied forces in Europe, with four additional American divisions to follow. There was considerable hesitation along the way, but the path to German remilitarization had been taken.","['December 1950', 'the same day']",meet soviet threat european leader want strong nato consequently fearful dalliance asian periphery result neglect europe british french german leader anxiously seek large permanent u.s military force continent soviet effort create united communist korea presage attempt unite german state red banner government share europe ’s apprehension want europeans contribute defense increasingly adviser washington think term need rearm germany german army provide critical manpower nato force central europe december 1950 formal discussion german contribution defense western europe begin day symbol commitment dwight d. eisenhower name supreme commander ally force europe additional division follow considerable hesitation way path german remilitarization take,99,[1950],1950,1,1975,2000

Most of the goods and services required by American forces in Korea were procured in Japan, providing the economy with a $4 billion stimulus. And in San Francisco in September 1951, forty-eight nations, led by the United States, signed a peace treaty with Japan, leading to the end of the occupation in May 1952. On the same day the treaty was signed, Japan and the United States signed a mutual security treaty to provide a demilitarized Japan with protection in an uncertain world.

Slowly the terror eased within the Soviet Union, especially after those competing for primacy within the leadership rid themselves of Lavrenti Beria, dreaded head of the secret police. Georgii Malenkov, who, in 1953, seemed to be Stalin’s likely successor, sought to reduce international tensions as well. He called for peaceful coexistence with the capitalist world, held out his hand to Tito in Yugoslavia, and offered assurances of Soviet goodwill to Turkey, Iran, and Greece. Israel, India, and Japan similarly received indications that Stalin’s death might mean improved relations with the Soviet Union. But Malenkov’s hold on power was tenuous, and those who vied with him were critical of his efforts to redirect foreign policy. It was not until after he was shunted aside, and Nikita Khrushchev continued his initiatives while providing a few of his own, that the main outlines of post-Stalinist policy were manifest.1",['1953'],stalin die slowly terror ease soviet union especially compete primacy leadership rid lavrenti beria dread head secret police georgii malenkov 1953 stalin ’s likely successor seek reduce international tension call peaceful coexistence capitalist world hold hand tito yugoslavia offer assurance soviet goodwill turkey iran greece israel india japan similarly receive indication stalin ’s death mean improved relation soviet union malenkov ’s hold power tenuous vie critical effort redirect foreign policy shunt aside nikita khrushchev continue initiative provide main outline post stalinist policy manifest.1,83,[1953],1953,1,1975,2000

Only weeks before Stalin’s death, a new administration had arrived in Washington, led by men who called for a more aggressive anti-Soviet policy, for the liberation of Eastern Europe, and for the “unleashing” of Chiang Kai-shek. These were people who would deny the Soviet Union the fruits of victory in World War II, deny the Soviets the influence and respect to which the world’s second most powerful nation was entitled. In addition, Stalin’s death had prompted the Chinese government to become more independent, a workers’ revolt exploded in East Germany in June 1953, and unrest mounted elsewhere in Stalin’s new empire.

Chiang had outmaneuvered him, massacred the Chinese Communists, and thrown out his Soviet advisers. Stalin was not going to repeat his mistake by supporting “bourgeois nationalist” leaders like Nehru of India, Sukarno of Indonesia, or Nasser of Egypt. The world, as Stalin saw it in the late 1940s, was divided into two camps: socialist and imperialist. Nehru, Sukarno, Nasser, and others of their ilk merely did the bidding of their former colonial masters, were still part of the imperialist camp.

1061,"Efforts to transcend Stalinist dogmatism began with the resurrection of the social sciences and the legitimate study of international relations. In 1956 an Institute of World Economics and International Relations was formed at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Western sources of information became available. Cautiously at first and with increasing boldness after the Twentieth Party Congress in 1956, Soviet analysts discovered and described the achievements of the Marshall Plan, the successful integration of the American, Western European, and Japanese economies, and the absence of conflict among the capitalist countries relative to what dogmatic Marxists had predicted. They reported the rapid recovery of European economies and the impressive rates of growth they demonstrated. Neither war nor depression was imminent in the capitalist world. At the same time, they reevaluated the role played in world affairs by newly independent states and saw some of them as potential allies in the struggle against American imperialism. They recognized the need to study these countries more closely, to develop area specialists in the academy. In general, by the mid-1950s they were beginning to provide their leaders in the Kremlin with information and advice more closely related to reality, less circumscribed by ideology, than had been possible while Stalin lived.4","['1956', '1956', 'the mid-1950s']",effort transcend stalinist dogmatism begin resurrection social science legitimate study international relation 1956 institute world economic international relation form soviet academy science western source information available cautiously increase boldness twentieth party congress 1956 soviet analyst discover describe achievement marshall plan successful integration western european japanese economy absence conflict capitalist country relative dogmatic marxist predict report rapid recovery european economy impressive rate growth demonstrate war depression imminent capitalist world time reevaluate role play world affair newly independent state see potential ally struggle imperialism recognize need study country closely develop area specialist academy general mid-1950 begin provide leader kremlin information advice closely related reality circumscribe ideology possible stalin lived.4,107,"[1956, 1956, 1950]",1954,3,1975,2000

At home, Stalin’s paranoid delusions, such as the alleged “doctors’ plot,” with its anti-Semitic implications and threat to all around him, were denounced. Men and women wrongly imprisoned or exiled, including Foreign Minister Molotov’s wife and Politburo member Anastas Mikoyan’s sons, returned to their families. Laws decreed in accordance with Stalin’s whims were erased. In the satellite states of Eastern Europe, Soviet economic pressures were relieved, and, after the volatile summer of 1953, local regimes were allowed greater authority over the allocation of resources. In East Asia, Malenkov and his colleagues quickly indicated their willingness to bring the war in Korea to an end.

1064,"Stalin was gone. First under Malenkov’s leadership, then Khrushchev’s, the apparatus of terror was being dismantled. The Soviet Union remained a Communist state.

It had five million men and women under arms, and, in August 1953, it exploded a thermonuclear (“hydrogen”) bomb. The Soviets would be dangerous rivals in the continuing competition for power and influence. But the post-Stalinist Soviet Union was a different country, led by relatively reasonable and responsible men, with whom agreement upon norms for peaceful competition might be attainable. Khrushchev quickly understood that the Leninist view that war between imperialism and socialism was inevitable was obsolete, that a major war had to be avoided in the nuclear age, when radiation and fallout respected no ideology. He remained ebulliently confident that socialism would prevail but without the cataclysm Lenin and Stalin foresaw. The superpowers would deter each other from using nuclear weapons, from a major confrontation, and the revolution would trickle in from the periphery, where the competition for wealth and power would continue. Soviet state interests would be protected and ideology adapted to reality.

Nixon, a young senator with a reputation for Red-baiting, as his running mate, and assigned Nixon the dirty work of discrediting the Democrats. Eisenhower allowed McCarthy to campaign for him, and stood by silently as McCarthy impugned the loyalty of George Marshall, to whom Eisenhower’s career owed so much. Dulles condemned the containment policy of Truman and Acheson as immoral and promised the “liberation of captive nations,” the rollback of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe and East Asia. Aware of how anti-Communist hysteria had impaired the Truman administration’s ability to govern, Eisenhower and Dulles hoped to deflect the Right with their rhetoric and by appointing a number of the darlings of the Right to nominally important posts. For Eisenhower and Dulles, the dogmatism of the Right created shoals only marginally easier to navigate than those Stalinist dogma left for Khrushchev.

1068,"The massive military buildup the United States carried out between 1951 and 1953 had eased fears in the American military and intelligence community of a Soviet nuclear attack in the mid-1950s. American superiority became so obvious that even the normally cautious military leaders, heeding administration bluster, eager to strike at the heart of Communist power, contemplated a preemptive attack against the Soviets. It took Dulles two years to bury the idea. But the enormous increase in military spending worried Eisenhower for other reasons. As an experienced military planner, he considered military budgets to be excessive, far higher than necessary to permit the armed services to perform their missions. As an economic thinker, Eisenhower ranked with Truman – pre-Keynesian, determined to balance the budget, fearful that deficits caused by the arms race would weaken the United States dangerously and result in an economic collapse that would leave it vulnerable. As the only postwar president whose views on military budgets were unimpeachable, Eisenhower was uniquely suited to depress the appetite of the Pentagon.5","['between 1951 and 1953', 'the mid-1950s', 'two years', 'Truman –']",massive military buildup united state carry 1951 1953 ease fear military intelligence community soviet nuclear attack mid-1950 superiority obvious normally cautious military leader heed administration bluster eager strike heart communist power contemplate preemptive attack soviet take dulle year bury idea enormous increase military spending worry eisenhower reason experienced military planner consider military budget excessive far high necessary permit armed service perform mission economic thinker eisenhower rank truman – pre keynesian determine balance budget fearful deficit cause arm race weaken united state dangerously result economic collapse leave vulnerable postwar president view military budget unimpeachable eisenhower uniquely suit depress appetite pentagon.5,99,[1950],1950,1,1975,2000

Despite their rhetoric, they had no intention of mounting a military challenge to the Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. By the mid-1950s, with West Germany in NATO and Austria free, with impressive economic growth in those countries linked to the Marshall Plan, Eisenhower and Dulles perceived little reason for fear in Europe.

After a speech he gave in March 1953 fell flat at home and abroad, he tried again with his Atoms for Peace plan, offered to the United Nations in December 1953. Eisenhower called for the nuclear powers to contribute fissionable material to an international agency that would oversee its use for peaceful purposes. Ultimately, his proposal led to creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency, but it had no impact on the arms race. The Soviets perceived the speech as a propaganda ploy, which they countered by repeating their call for a joint declaration banning the atom bomb. The United States did not follow up with any proposal to stop producing weapons or a diplomatic campaign to engage the Soviets in serious discussion of the issues.

It gained support from men uninterested in arms control who saw an opportunity to gain an intelligence advantage or a propaganda victory over the Soviets. At the summit meeting in July 1955, Eisenhower proposed that each participant give the other a blueprint of its military establishments and permit aerial surveillance adequate to assure that no surprise attack was in preparation. Khrushchev, suspicious of American intentions, perhaps fearful that the United States would learn too much about relative Soviet weakness if granted broad access to Soviet airspace, was not interested. Two years later, however, when the Soviets agreed to a partial version of the aerial inspection proposal, the United States reversed itself. The best Eisenhower and Khrushchev could accomplish was a moratorium on nuclear testing, gingerly reached and unenforceable, but at least an indication that both men recognized the dangers of radioactive fallout and that the two nations, slowly and ineptly, were learning to work together.8","['A year and a half later', 'July 1955', 'Two years later']",year half later eisenhower prepare meeting new soviet leader aide come forward come know “ open sky ” proposal gain support man uninterested arm control see opportunity gain intelligence advantage propaganda victory soviet summit meeting july 1955 eisenhower propose participant blueprint military establishment permit aerial surveillance adequate assure surprise attack preparation khrushchev suspicious intention fearful united state learn relative soviet weakness grant broad access soviet airspace interested year later soviet agree partial version aerial inspection proposal united state reverse good eisenhower khrushchev accomplish moratorium nuclear testing gingerly reach unenforceable indication man recognize danger radioactive fallout nation slowly ineptly learn work together.8,101,[1955],1955,1,1975,2000
1072,"American strategic thinking was moving in the opposite direction, however. American leaders were convinced that a rearmed Germany, integrated into the Western alliance, was essential to European and ultimately American security. The creation of a European Defense Community (EDC) had been proposed during the Truman administration, and the idea was pursued vigorously by Dulles. When the French balked, at least as fearful of potential German power as they were of Soviet, unwilling to have their forces submerged in a multinational force, Dulles threatened an “agonizing reappraisal” of the American role in Europe. Failure of France to ratify the EDC agreement did not deter the United States. In October 1954 the British brokered a new agreement, which narrowly won French approval. Critical among its provisions was a British commitment to send troops to the continent, an American pledge to retain forces in Europe, and German agreement not to challenge post–World War II boundaries or to acquire missiles or nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons without NATO approval.

Little of substance was accomplished at the meeting, but the symbolic importance was enormous. Soviet and American leaders were talking for the first time since Potsdam in 1945 and attempting to persuade rather than bludgeon each other.

1074,"Despite the failure of a foreign ministers’ conference that followed the summit, the year after the Eisenhower-Khrushchev encounter was marked by further indications that the Cold War might be winding down. In February 1956, Khrushchev delivered his famous speech to the Twentieth Party Congress, denouncing Stalin and endorsing peaceful coexistence. In April, Mikoyan announced dissolution of the Cominform, relinquishing Moscow’s claim to control of all foreign Communist parties. In May, the Soviets reported major troop reductions, from 4 million to 2.8 million. Stalinist Russia was slowly being dismantled, and the Soviets were changing both their approach to world affairs and the nature of the regime.

They were able to discount Soviet willingness to compromise in Poland and Soviet willingness to accept a considerable degree of diversity among Communist states. They were able to brush aside “de-Stalinization” and argue that all the perceived changes were cosmetic or tactical, that the United States still confronted a brutal, ruthless, totalitarian enemy, unyielding in its determination to dominate the world.

1077,"The first post-Korean crisis in the region came in Indochina, where the Vietnamese were fighting for their independence from the French Empire. American anticommunism proved stronger than American antiimperialism. Eager for French support for the rearming of Germany and European integration against the Soviets generally, the United States had become, by 1953, an active supporter of France against the Vietnamese Communist–led revolutionaries. Proponents of American assistance to the French effort in Indochina also argued that the region’s strategic resources had to be kept out of Communist hands, that its markets were essential to the viability of the Japanese economy. Aid to the French, begun before the Korean War, accelerated after it. American consciences were assuaged by giving much of the material support directly to Vietnamese who were collaborating with the French, an effort to distance the United States from French imperialism. But American money and equipment did not suffice. By March 1954, the French faced certain defeat and ultimate expulsion, unless American military forces came to their rescue.","['1953', 'March 1954']",post korean crisis region come indochina vietnamese fight independence french empire anticommunism prove strong antiimperialism eager french support rearming germany european integration soviet generally united state 1953 active supporter france vietnamese communist – lead revolutionary proponent assistance french effort indochina argue region ’s strategic resource keep communist hand market essential viability japanese economy aid french begin korean war accelerate conscience assuage give material support directly vietnamese collaborate french effort distance united state french imperialism money equipment suffice march 1954 french face certain defeat ultimate expulsion military force come rescue,89,"[1953, 1954]",1954,2,1975,2000
1078,"Ho Chi Minh’s forces had won a great victory in their long struggle for freedom from French imperialism, but the accords that emerged from the Geneva Conference in February did not reflect the triumph adequately. A truce was arranged between Vietnamese and French forces. Vietnam was partitioned temporarily to enable the combatants to disengage on either side of the seventeenth parallel. The temporary partition, to be followed by a nationwide election in 1956, was forced on Ho by his erstwhile Soviet and Chinese supporters, the former hoping to curry favor with France and the latter fearful that Vietnamese recalcitrance might bring American intervention and jeopardize their interests in the region. But Ho could count on an easy victory in the election and accepted the delay in the creation of a united, independent Vietnam.","['February', '1956']",ho chi minh ’s force win great victory long struggle freedom french imperialism accord emerge geneva conference february reflect triumph adequately truce arrange vietnamese french force vietnam partition temporarily enable combatant disengage seventeenth parallel temporary partition follow nationwide election 1956 force ho erstwhile soviet chinese supporter hop curry favor france fearful vietnamese recalcitrance bring intervention jeopardize interest region ho count easy victory election accept delay creation united independent vietnam,69,[1956],1956,1,1975,2000
1079,"The United States participated in the Geneva Conference but did not sign the accords, promising only that it would not upset them by force. Immediately, however, the American government set about subverting the agreement, substituting American influence for French and attempting to convert the truce line into a permanent boundary. The United States tried to create a separate Vietnamese state in the south, intended to be part of the anti-Communist bloc. There would be no election to unify Vietnam in 1956. Communism would be contained at the seventeenth parallel, with a southern Vietnamese regime, Cambodia, and Laos becoming American protectorates. None of these nations was of particular importance to the United States, but through use of the domino analogy, the idea that the fall of any one of them would result in the “loss” of all of Southeast Asia, Eisenhower had invested each tiny state with the importance of the entire region. Declining to intervene militarily but refusing to accept Communist domination of Indochina, the Eisenhower administration directed the United States deeper into the quagmire.14","['1956', 'the fall']",united state participate geneva conference sign accord promise upset force immediately government set subvert agreement substitute influence french attempt convert truce line permanent boundary united state try create separate vietnamese state south intend anti communist bloc election unify vietnam 1956 communism contain seventeenth parallel southern vietnamese regime cambodia laos protectorate nation particular importance united state use domino analogy idea fall result “ loss ” southeast asia eisenhower invest tiny state importance entire region decline intervene militarily refuse accept communist domination indochina eisenhower administration direct united state deeper quagmire.14,88,[1956],1956,1,1975,2000
1080,"A few weeks after the Geneva Conference, in September 1954, the United States staged a fateful meeting in Manila. There, under Dulles’s supervision, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) was created to provide for the region’s security. The United States joined Great Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, the Philippines, and Pakistan in an attempt to deter the further expansion of Communist influence in the area, with specific reference to southern Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. India and Indonesia, the most important states of South and Southeast Asia, rejected membership, as did Burma. Obviously, SEATO was but a shadow analogue of NATO, but Washington now claimed a legal basis for intervention.

Before the crisis ended, he was forced to evacuate the Dachen Islands. Jinmen and Mazu (Quemoy and Matsu) remained under Nationalist control, but the Americans would defend them only if Washington perceived a threat to Taiwan itself. Chiang was further angered in March 1955 when Dulles told him to stop telling his people that their return to the mainland was imminent.

Their effort to prevent the mutual defense treaty between the United States and the Republic of China had failed, but they had succeeded in alarming many of America’s allies, especially Europeans unwilling to participate in a third world war precipitated by a confrontation over the islands. Having gained Washington’s attention, the Chinese offered to negotiate existing differences with the United States, including the release of Americans held in China and Chinese stranded in the United States when the two countries became enemies in 1950.

The United States demanded that China renounce the right to use force to seize the island, and China refused.

They hinted broadly that force would not be used, stressed the likelihood of peaceful liberation of the island, but would not give the explicit assurances the United States required. Hemmed in by Chiang’s supporters in the United States, accepting as reality his own rationalization for a policy of maintaining pressure on the People’s Republic, Dulles evidenced no flexibility.

1084,"In Beijing the initiative passed to those Chinese leaders, Mao among them, who preferred a more aggressive approach. Buoyed by Soviet successes in the space race, Mao contended that the time had come for a bold Communist offensive against imperialism. He found Khrushchev unresponsive. Khrushchev, too, was confident that the tide was running his way, but he had no illusions about American power or Soviet vulnerability. He did not want a confrontation, certainly not one of China’s choosing. Contemptuous of Khrushchev’s prudence, Mao chose his own moment. In late August 1958, China initiated a campaign to seize Jinmen and Mazu, precipitating a second crisis in the Taiwan Strait.17",['late August 1958'],beij initiative pass chinese leader mao prefer aggressive approach buoy soviet success space race mao contend time come bold communist offensive imperialism find khrushchev unresponsive khrushchev confident tide run way illusion power soviet vulnerability want confrontation certainly china ’s choosing contemptuous khrushchev ’s prudence mao choose moment late august 1958 china initiate campaign seize jinman mazu precipitate second crisis taiwan strait.17,61,[1958],1958,1,1975,2000

Soviet offers of military advisers and requests for submarine basing rights and a radio station on Chinese soil to broadcast to Soviet submarines aroused Mao’s suspicions. The terms of Soviet economic and technical assistance did not satisfy Mao. In the late 1950s Soviet foreign policy generally evoked Mao’s contempt, and Soviet domestic policies, specifically de-Stalinization, did little to warm his heart. Khrushchev’s suggestion that Beijing accept the two Chinas policy toward which the United States had moved struck at the core of Mao’s intense nationalism, confirmed Mao’s sense of Soviet indifference to China’s interests, and may have precipitated the break. Angry exchanges, focused primarily on differences over ideological matters, led to Khrushchev’s recall of Soviet technicians in 1959 and his effort to scuttle China’s atom bomb project.19","['the late 1950s', '1959']",gradually tie bind communist giant begin fray soviet advice design moderate chinese policy avoid provocation irritated mao soviet offer military adviser request submarine base right radio station chinese soil broadcast soviet submarine arouse mao ’s suspicion term soviet economic technical assistance satisfy mao late 1950 soviet foreign policy generally evoke mao ’s contempt soviet domestic policy specifically de stalinization little warm heart khrushchev ’s suggestion beijing accept chinas policy united state move strike core mao ’s intense nationalism confirm mao ’s sense soviet indifference china ’s interest precipitate break angry exchange focus primarily difference ideological matter lead khrushchev ’s recall soviet technician 1959 effort scuttle china ’s atom bomb project.19,110,"[1950, 1959]",1954,2,1975,2000

With Dulles’s death early in 1959 and Eisenhower’s weariness of Asian affairs, there were no new initiatives coming out of Washington in 1959 or 1960.

He raised a question fundamental to the alliance in an era when the Soviets were preparing to deploy intercontinental ballistic missiles: Would the United States risk a nuclear attack on its own cities by responding to a Soviet attack on Western Europe?

Freed of the forces of occupation in 1952, secured from external threat by alliance with the United States, Japan concentrated on rapid economic growth, aided by profits from supply and support services it provided during the Korean War. The Japanese wanted access to American and Chinese markets and persuaded Eisenhower to support them. The president perceived Japan’s economic stability as essential to American security interests. He argued frequently against protectionism in the United States and against posing obstacles to Japan’s trade with Beijing.

For centuries Jews in the diaspora called for a return to Jerusalem as part of their Passover celebration. Secular Jewish nationalism, Zionism, emerged in Europe late in the nineteenth century and a few thousand Jews trickled into Palestine in the years that followed. The British, who took control of Palestine from the Ottoman Empire during World War I, made conflicting promises to the Arab Muslims who lived there and to the European Jews who sought a homeland there. After the Holocaust, the German murder of six million Jews during World War II, American and British leaders saw Palestine as a convenient refuge for the Jewish survivors of the Nazi death camps. Palestinian Arabs and the Arabs of neighboring states forcibly opposed the UN decision to partition Palestine in order to create a Jewish homeland there. In April 1948, the Jews declared the existence of the state of Israel on that part of Palestine allotted to them by the United Nations. A major war followed, in which the Jews, thanks in part to arms provided by Soviet-dominated Czechoslovakia, prevailed over vastly larger Arab armies and created a state even larger than the United Nations had intended.

American leaders were also conscious of the fact that in the aftermath of the Holocaust, there was enormous public support among American Christians as well as Jews for the creation of a Jewish homeland. Politicians were not unaware that there were votes to be gained from supporting creation of the state of Israel, from being quick to recognize it.

Like any nineteenth-century imperial power exercising suzerainty over a client state, the United States decided to replace the Iranian leadership. Covertly, with the assistance of British operatives, the American Central Intelligence Agency facilitated a military coup in August 1953, resulting in the arrest of Mossadegh and the shift of power in Iran to the Shah. For many years afterward, the Shah responded to American needs with appropriate gratitude, including a 40 percent share for American companies in a new international consortium to manage Iranian oil production.

Between Turkey and Pakistan sat the Arab world, Iran, and two-thirds of the oil reserves accessible to the West – all terribly vulnerable to a Soviet thrust. The Truman administration had recognized the danger but failed in its effort to enroll Egypt in a Middle East defense command. Egypt remained uninterested and opposed to any Arab nation aligning itself with the West. Nonetheless, it was time to complete the circle. Turkey was eager to strengthen its eastern flank against the Soviets. Iraq saw an opportunity to protect itself against possible Soviet pressures while simultaneously alleviating its dependence on the British. Pakistan perceived an opportunity to obtain military aid more likely to be needed against India than the Soviet Union. As the Americans and British hovered in the background, desirous of proceeding, but still groping for a formula that would not enrage the Israelis and Egyptians, the Turks seized the initiative. In February 1956, Turkey and Iraq signed what came to be called the Baghdad Pact, to which the British, Pakistanis, and Iranians adhered in the course of the year.

Nasser emerged as master of Egypt after a group of young officers, appalled by defeat in the 1948 war with Israel and evidence of government corruption and incompetence, overthrew a decadent king in 1952. Nasser and his colleagues were quick to demand elimination of European restrictions on Egyptian sovereignty, and the British had neither the will nor the resources to resist. The United States, sympathetic to Egyptian aspirations, impressed favorably by Nasser and eager to win his friendship, favored the initial British retreat. Nasser’s satisfaction with the American position did not extend to the point of willingness to be enlisted in the containment of the Soviet Union; nor did he prove willing to moderate the anti-Israeli and antiimperialist rhetoric so popular in the Arab world.26","['1948', '1952']",man likely lead arab world renew glory respect gamal abdul nasser egypt nasser emerge master egypt group young officer appal defeat 1948 war israel evidence government corruption incompetence overthrow decadent king 1952 nasser colleague quick demand elimination european restriction egyptian sovereignty british resource resist united state sympathetic egyptian aspiration impress favorably nasser eager win friendship favor initial british retreat nasser ’s satisfaction position extend point willingness enlist containment soviet union prove willing moderate anti israeli antiimperialist rhetoric popular arab world.26,80,"[1948, 1952]",1950,2,1975,2000

Confident of the superiority of the Soviet system, unburdened by commitment to Israel, sharing Arab hostility to Western imperialism, Khrushchev and his colleagues accepted the challenge of the Baghdad Pact and the opportunity Nasser provided. The Soviets were prepared to supply economic and military assistance to nonaligned leaders who sought an alternative to dependence on the West or a more radical model for rapid development of their countries. In September 1955, arrangements were concluded for arms manufactured in Czechoslovakia to be shipped to Egypt. By inducing Iraq to join in the American-led effort to contain the Soviet Union, the United States had facilitated Soviet penetration of the region, giving the Soviets an opportunity to befriend Iraq’s rival, Egypt.27",['September 1955'],khrushchev unlike stalin definitely interested compete united state influence arabs confident superiority soviet system unburden commitment israel share arab hostility western imperialism khrushchev colleague accept challenge baghdad pact opportunity nasser provide soviet prepared supply economic military assistance nonaligned leader seek alternative dependence west radical model rapid development country september 1955 arrangement conclude arm manufacture czechoslovakia ship egypt induce iraq join lead effort contain soviet union united state facilitate soviet penetration region give soviet opportunity befriend iraq ’s rival egypt.27,79,[1955],1955,1,1975,2000

For Nasser and leaders of other nonaligned states who mastered the art, it was a delightful situation. The competing superpowers were manipulated with varying degrees of artistry. American and Soviet leaders sang the virtues of a wide range of African and Asian rulers and contributed generously of their treasure, their technology, and their guns. With Czech arms on the way, Nasser found the Americans (and the British) eager to build a dam for him, to help him subdue the Nile, and to use its power to irrigate and electrify the Nile Valley. He wanted the aid, but with Soviet assistance also available, he saw no need to trim his sails to comfort the Americans. The arms deal, perceived as a slap at the West, had enhanced Nasser’s stature among the Arab masses. He promised them he would do something unpleasant to Israel.

1103,"Enraged, lacking assurance of Soviet funding for his dam, Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, which was owned by a British-controlled corporation. Once again, he stuck his finger in the eye of the Western imperialists, to the delight of many Arabs. Perhaps he would be able to finance his dam project with the canal’s revenues. Eisenhower and Dulles responded cautiously; British prime minister Anthony Eden did not. To the Americans, Suez was far away, a convenience rather than a vital interest. Who controlled the canal was less important than keeping the Arabs friendly, friendly enough to keep oil flowing to the West and Soviet influence out of the region. The use of force to keep the canal under European or international management was not an acceptable option. To Eden, however, the canal was a critical artery linking British and Western European industry to Persian Gulf oil. Nasser had committed an act of wanton aggression. As he had opposed the appeasement of Hitler in the 1930s, Eden was determined not to appease Nasser. He was convinced that Nasser, like Hitler, could be stopped only with force.30",['the 1930s'],enraged lack assurance soviet funding dam nasser nationalize suez canal own british control corporation stick finger eye western imperialist delight arab able finance dam project canal ’s revenue eisenhower dulle respond cautiously british prime minister anthony eden american suez far away convenience vital interest control canal important keep arabs friendly friendly oil flow west soviet influence region use force canal european international management acceptable option eden canal critical artery link british western european industry persian gulf oil nasser commit act wanton aggression oppose appeasement hitler 1930 eden determine appease nasser convince nasser like hitler stop force.30,96,[1930],1930,1,1950,1950

They talked, they listened, and they prepared for the military action they believed necessary. In the French and the Israelis they found willing accomplices. The French shared British concerns about the canal and were angered by Nasser’s support for Algerian efforts to achieve independence from French rule. The Israelis were profoundly troubled by the shipment of Soviet arms to Egypt and the refusal of the United States to provide Israel with either additional arms or assurances. Israeli leaders perceived the United States as having abandoned the Jews as the Arabs prepared to destroy them. They would not watch passively: After the Holocaust, never again!

It gave the president discretion to aid countries there, with American forces if necessary, when a country asked for help to repel “overt armed aggression from any nation controlled by international communism.” The resolution was soon known as the Eisenhower Doctrine. Designed to check Nasser’s influence as well as Soviet, it was applicable to no known situation in the region. The doctrine was used in 1957 when the king of Jordan, threatened by pro-Nasser forces within his country and without, appealed for help, claiming, not surprisingly, that the danger came from “international communism.” The U.S. Sixth Fleet showed the flag in the eastern Mediterranean, and the king received $10 million in American aid.",['1957'],aftermath suez crisis eisenhower signal gravity concern ask receive congress resolution declare middle east vital national interest give president discretion aid country force necessary country ask help repel “ overt armed aggression nation control international communism ” resolution soon know eisenhower doctrine design check nasser ’s influence soviet applicable known situation region doctrine 1957 king jordan threaten pro nasser force country appeal help claim surprisingly danger come “ international communism ” u.s sixth fleet show flag eastern mediterranean king receive 10 million aid,83,[1957],1957,1,1975,2000

There was no evidence that international communism was involved, although both Egypt and Syria, with links to the Soviets, were. Washington was unresponsive until a coup in Iraq substituted a pro-Nasser, pro-Soviet regime for the one that had signed the Baghdad Pact. Confronted with a situation in which Nasser’s power seemed to have united the Arab world, eliminated the West’s principal ally, and become an increment to Soviet influence in the area, the United States sent marines to Lebanon. Khrushchev, fearing American intervention in Iraq, threatened war. Quickly, the United States determined that the Soviets were not involved in the coup in Iraq; that the new Iraqi leadership was intensely nationalistic, anti-Western to be sure, but unlikely to submit to their country’s becoming a Soviet satellite. Recognition of the Baghdad regime by Washington defused the crisis. Nasser, undesirous of a permanent American military presence in the region, used his influence to calm his friends in Lebanon and Syria, facilitating the withdrawal of the marines.

Concerns over Berlin and Cuba led American forces to confront Soviet forces in situations in which a misstep, a rash action by an aggressive or nervous officer, might have led to war, might have led to the incineration and irradiation of much of the world. Nikita Khrushchev provoked each of these crises. The Soviet triumph in the space race – the launching of Sputnik in 1957 – confirmed his faith in the ultimate triumph of communism, and he hoped to accelerate the process in the era of his leadership. He found American arrogance intolerable and was intensely eager to terminate it by reversing the strategic balance. Berlin he delighted in calling the “testicles” of the West: “Every time I give them a yank they holler.”1 Cuba, ninety miles from the coast of Florida, provided a convenient platform for placing the nuclear missiles that would teach Americans what it felt like to live under the shadow of the bomb and would put an end to the American penchant for nuclear blackmail.","['the years 1958–62', 'the four decades', '1957']",tension year 1958–62 parallel decade follow world war ii concern berlin cuba lead force confront soviet force situation misstep rash action aggressive nervous officer lead war lead incineration irradiation world nikita khrushchev provoke crisis soviet triumph space race – launching sputnik 1957 – confirm faith ultimate triumph communism hop accelerate process era leadership find arrogance intolerable intensely eager terminate reverse strategic balance berlin delight call “ testicle ” west “ time yank holler.”1 cuba ninety mile coast florida provide convenient platform place nuclear missile teach american feel like live shadow bomb end penchant nuclear blackmail,95,"[1958, 1957]",1958,2,1975,2000

Soviet apprehensions about a resurgent Germany did not disappear, however. Germany’s economic revival probably worried all non-Germans, but it was fear that the West Germans would gain access to nuclear weapons that most troubled Khrushchev and his colleagues. The United States was stockpiling “tactical” nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable of reaching the Soviet Union on German soil. The Germans had demanded and had been given nuclear-capable artillery and fighter-bombers. The Soviets were anxious to negotiate a settlement of European political issues that would recognize the status quo, including a divided Germany. They were equally interested in arms talks that would lead to a demilitarized or at least nuclear-free Central Europe. But Soviet overtures were unwelcome in Washington, where domestic and alliance politics precluded serious consideration of any plan approximating the neutralization of Central Europe, even when it came from George Kennan in his “disengagement” lectures of 1957.

It was obvious that the West German army wanted at least tactical nuclear weapons and was interested in strategic missiles – and that the United States was leaning toward acquiescence. In February 1958, the American commander of NATO declared that “defensive atomic weapons are absolutely indispensable for the strengthening of the defensive power of the Bundeswehr.”2 A project to train a German air force unit for atomic attack and the installation of a storage facility near where it was stationed were completed late in 1958.

Mao, in Beijing, certainly thought the time had come for the international Communist movement to take the initiative, as did several of Khrushchev’s more belligerent colleagues in the Kremlin. Auspicious as the moment may have been from the Soviet perspective, it was hardly an opportune time for the Americans, who were left sputtering like their fizzled Vanguard rockets. Khrushchev waited a year, until after the Taiwan Strait crisis had passed, until after the midterm congressional elections of 1958, and then announced that the Western powers had six months in which to negotiate the status of West Berlin with East German authorities. When the deadline passed, the Soviets would sign a separate peace treaty with the East Germans, leaving them responsible for Western access to Berlin. To Dulles’s warning that the West would use force if necessary to ensure its access to Berlin, Khrushchev replied that World War III would follow. Later in the Berlin crisis Khrushchev told Averell Harriman, “If you send in tanks, they will burn and make no mistake about it. If you want war, you can have it, and remember it will be your war. Our rockets will fly automatically.”3","['1957', 'a year', '1958', 'six months']",late 1957 launching sputnik khrushchev begin campaign summit meeting eisenhower mao beijing certainly think time come international communist movement initiative khrushchev ’s belligerent colleague kremlin auspicious moment soviet perspective hardly opportune time american leave sputter like fizzle vanguard rocket khrushchev wait year taiwan strait crisis pass midterm congressional election 1958 announce western power month negotiate status west berlin east german authority deadline pass soviet sign separate peace treaty east german leave responsible western access berlin dulles ’s warning west use force necessary ensure access berlin khrushchev reply world war iii follow later berlin crisis khrushchev tell averell harriman “ send tank burn mistake want war remember war rocket fly automatically.”3,110,"[1957, 1958]",1958,2,1975,2000
1125,"Eisenhower was not stampeded by Khrushchev’s rhetoric and refused to negotiate under ultimatum. He and Dulles, before the latter’s death in 1959, both recognized the need to treat the Soviets with more civility, however – a relatively easy matter at the end of their days in office, when there was no political capital left to squander. Khrushchev was invited to the United States, spent a weekend at Camp David with Eisenhower, toured Hollywood, and went home unfulfilled when security precautions cheated him out of an opportunity to visit Disneyland. The deadline on Berlin was lifted, nonetheless. Khrushchev continued to raise the issue and apparently expected to resolve it at the summit meeting scheduled for May 1960. West German opposition, however, probably precluded any compromise over Berlin. By the spring of 1960, the American government knew unequivocally, from intelligence gathered by U-2 overflights of the Soviet Union, that Khrushchev’s claims of missile superiority were unwarranted. Khrushchev knew, from the downing of a U-2 on the eve of the conference, that the Americans were aware that he was bluffing, were aware of the relative weakness of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev walked out of the summit, ostensibly over the U-2 issue; the Berlin issue smoldered, and flared dangerously again in June of 1961, to be confronted by the administration of John F. Kennedy.","['1959', '–', 'the end of their days', 'a weekend', 'May 1960', 'the spring of 1960', 'June of 1961']",eisenhower stampede khrushchev ’s rhetoric refuse negotiate ultimatum dulle ’s death 1959 recognize need treat soviet civility – relatively easy matter end day office political capital leave squander khrushchev invite united state spend weekend camp david eisenhower tour hollywood go home unfulfilled security precaution cheat opportunity visit disneyland deadline berlin lift nonetheless khrushchev continue raise issue apparently expect resolve summit meeting schedule 1960 west german opposition probably preclude compromise berlin spring 1960 government know unequivocally intelligence gather u-2 overflight soviet union khrushchev ’s claim missile superiority unwarranted khrushchev know downing u-2 eve conference american aware bluff aware relative weakness soviet union khrushchev walk summit ostensibly u-2 issue berlin issue smolder flare dangerously june 1961 confront administration john f. kennedy,119,"[1959, 1960, 1960, 1961]",1960,4,1975,2000
1126,"Closer to home, the Eisenhower administration became intensely irritated with Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader who had been transmogrified from a Robin Hood–like figure, liberating his people from the evil ruler, Fulgencio Batista, into a possible Marxist-Leninist, an instrument of the international Communist movement suddenly rooted in America’s sphere of influence. Batista had lost the confidence of Cuban elites and ultimately any hope of support from Washington, despite rumors of Communist influence in the revolutionary forces that sought to depose him. In due course he left for Miami, and early in January 1959, Castro led his guerrillas, the major fighting force of the revolution, into Havana and quickly organized a government.",['January 1959'],close home eisenhower administration intensely irritated fidel castro cuban leader transmogrify robin hood – like figure liberate people evil ruler fulgencio batista possible marxist leninist instrument international communist movement suddenly root america ’s sphere influence batista lose confidence cuban elite ultimately hope support washington despite rumor communist influence revolutionary force seek depose course leave miami early january 1959 castro lead guerrilla major fighting force revolution havana quickly organize government,69,[1959],1959,1,1975,2000
1127,"The new Cuban government was passionately nationalistic and moderately leftist. In Latin American terms, that meant suspicion of the United States, longtime regional hegemon, and especially of American economic power. But initially, the regime in Havana was non-Communist, even anti-Communist, and included many men considered proponents of democratic capitalism, of programs no more radical than Roosevelt’s New Deal. Quickly, however, moderate leaders gave way to radicals, the pace of reforms, including the expropriation of property owned by Americans, accelerated, the prospects for liberal democracy dimmed, and Castro gave a series of speeches critical of the United States. The Cuban Communist party was legalized and its members began to play a role, although relatively minor, in the implementation of Castro’s programs. Indications of increased Communist influence worried Eisenhower, but the CIA detected no evidence of a Soviet role, no evidence that Castro might himself be a Communist. In February 1960, however, responding to Castro’s overtures, Khrushchev sent his deputy premier, Anastas Mikoyan, to Cuba, ostensibly to visit a trade fair. A Cuban-Soviet trade agreement followed. That was enough to galvanize Eisenhower. An alternative to Castro, a Cuban government composed of the kind of democratic reformers who had worked with Castro to overthrow Batista, was clearly necessary. Eisenhower would not countenance sending in the marines, as Teddy Roosevelt or Woodrow Wilson might well have done. On the other hand, he hardly needed the marines: He had the CIA.4",['February 1960'],new cuban government passionately nationalistic moderately leftist latin term mean suspicion united state longtime regional hegemon especially economic power initially regime havana non communist anti communist include man consider proponent democratic capitalism program radical roosevelt ’s new deal quickly moderate leader give way radical pace reform include expropriation property own american accelerate prospect liberal democracy dim castro give series speech critical united state cuban communist party legalize member begin play role relatively minor implementation castro ’s program indication increase communist influence worry eisenhower cia detect evidence soviet role evidence castro communist february 1960 respond castro ’s overture khrushchev send deputy premier anasta mikoyan cuba ostensibly visit trade fair cuban soviet trade agreement follow galvanize eisenhower alternative castro cuban government compose kind democratic reformer work castro overthrow batista clearly necessary eisenhower countenance send marine teddy roosevelt woodrow wilson hand hardly need marine cia.4,142,[1960],1960,1,1975,2000
1128,"American hostility served Castro well, both in rallying the Cuban people behind his increasingly radical domestic program and in gaining the support of a wary Khrushchev. In May 1960, diplomatic relations were established between Cuba and the Soviet Union, and Khrushchev once again rattled his rockets, warning the United States not to attack Cuba. Soviet leaders were still skeptical about Castro’s intentions and uneasy about challenging the United States in its sphere of interest, but the opportunity to twit the Americans proved irresistible. A pattern that men like Nasser and Sukarno had previously exploited quickly developed. As the United States intensified its pressures on Castro, he turned more and more to the Soviet bloc for support. Unlike Nasser and Sukarno, somewhere along the line, in late 1960 or 1961, Castro decided to become a Marxist-Leninist.","['May 1960', 'late 1960 or 1961']",hostility serve castro rally cuban people increasingly radical domestic program gain support wary khrushchev 1960 diplomatic relation establish cuba soviet union khrushchev rattle rocket warn united state attack cuba soviet leader skeptical castro ’s intention uneasy challenge united state sphere interest opportunity twit american prove irresistible pattern man like nasser sukarno previously exploit quickly develop united state intensify pressure castro turn soviet bloc support unlike nasser sukarno line late 1960 1961 castro decide marxist leninist,75,[1960],1960,1,1975,2000

A less hostile policy, an acceptance of the Cuban revolution, however grudging, without assassination and invasion plots, might have lessened Castro’s need for Soviet assistance and might have left Khrushchev less of an opportunity for mischief.

1132,"Soviet hopes for accommodation were matched in Washington, but Khrushchev’s terms were not acceptable. No less than its predecessors, the Kennedy administration was committed to containing communism, to preventing the spread of Soviet influence, and to maintaining and capitalizing on American strategic superiority. Kennedy and his advisers were profoundly troubled by Khrushchev’s threats regarding Berlin as well as Soviet activities in the Congo, Laos, and Cuba. Moreover, Khrushchev’s signals were often confusing, an unfortunate mixture of appeals for peaceful coexistence and attempts to intimidate. On January 6, 1961, addressing a Communist party rally in Moscow, Khrushchev stressed Soviet commitment to “wars of national liberation,” just wars that would ensure communism’s ultimate victory in the struggle with the West. Kennedy’s Soviet specialists interpreted the speech as an intensely hostile warning of increased guerrilla activity and subversion in the Third World.7 On February 17, the Soviets resumed pressure on Berlin.

Dean Rusk, the secretary of state, skeptical of CIA estimates of a popular uprising in support of the invaders, fearful that American involvement would be exposed, preferred economic sanctions. But in addition to the exile disposal problem, there was the likelihood that rejection of the CIA plan would be leaked to the public. Kennedy, who had been critical of Eisenhower’s “loss” of Cuba, could ill afford the domestic political ramifications of appearing weaker than Eisenhower, of having canceled a plan the Eisenhower administration had devised for overthrowing Castro. To meet Rusk’s concerns, the operation was whittled back, the invaders denied air cover the CIA deemed essential.

They attempted to overthrow the Cuban government and they had failed miserably.

But the aura of crisis faded once the Soviets concluded the United States could not be persuaded under any circumstances to remove its forces from West Berlin.

1138,"The Kennedy administration had not been inactive toward Cuba since recovering from the failure of the Bay of Pigs operation. Diplomatically, it had won modest support for its efforts to isolate the Castro regime within the hemisphere and nominal support from its NATO allies for its economic warfare against Cuba. Although Kennedy had declared publicly that a Communist regime in Cuba was intolerable, no further thought was being given to using Cuban exile forces to overthrow Castro. On the other hand, the American government was doing little to suppress piratical acts by exiles against Cuban vessels; and far worse, it was experimenting with a variety of covert operations, some of which were designed to humiliate Castro – and others, to murder him. Perhaps most threatening were contingency plans for American forces to invade the island and the major exercises conducted in the spring of 1962 to test these plans. Soviet and Cuban intelligence services were aware of some of the plots and of the existence of contingency plans for an invasion, which they may have believed imminent. The Cuban government unquestionably had reason to be anxious, to lean more heavily on the Soviet Union, to allow the Soviets to build missile sites directed against the United States.14",['the spring of 1962'],kennedy administration inactive cuba recover failure bay pig operation diplomatically win modest support effort isolate castro regime hemisphere nominal support nato ally economic warfare cuba kennedy declare publicly communist regime cuba intolerable thought give cuban exile force overthrow castro hand government little suppress piratical act exile cuban vessel far bad experiment variety covert operation design humiliate castro – murder threatening contingency plan force invade island major exercise conduct spring 1962 test plan soviet cuban intelligence service aware plot existence contingency plan invasion believe imminent cuban government unquestionably reason anxious lean heavily soviet union allow soviet build missile site direct united states.14,101,[1962],1962,1,1975,2000
1139,"Men and women usually see their self-serving acts as altruistic, their aggressive acts as defensive. The study of motivation is no easier when one examines foreign policy decisions than other human endeavors. Khrushchev may well have contrived an explanation for his decision after he decided impulsively to send the missiles. Without doubt he chafed at the fact of Soviet strategic inferiority and its implications for the German question and every other matter at issue with the United States. The Gilpatric speech of October 1961 had revealed to the world the lack of substance behind Khrushchev’s claims of Soviet superiority. Something had to be done to redress the strategic balance. In April 1962, Khrushchev was troubled at the news that American intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) in Turkey, on the very border of the Soviet Union, had become operational. It was at that moment that he apparently conceived of the idea of placing Soviet IRBMs in the shadow of the United States, in Cuba. As Raymond Garthoff, a participant in the events and later scholarly analyst of them, has argued, the most likely reason for Soviet leaders’ risking the Cuban missile venture “was almost certainly a perceived need to prevent the United States from using its growing strategic superiority to compel Soviet concessions ... a shared judgment of the leadership that world political perceptions of the strategic balance mattered, and that the Soviet Union’s position in 1962 needed shoring up.”16 The fact that Cuba would simultaneously be protected was a likely collateral virtue of the action but, as students of causality might argue, not a “sufficient cause.” It is quite clear that the Soviets did not anticipate a crisis: They expected to be able to install the missiles secretly and to present the United States with a fait accompli, to which Washington would acquiesce reluctantly.","['October 1961', 'April 1962', '1962']",man woman usually self serve act altruistic aggressive act defensive study motivation easy examine foreign policy decision human endeavor khrushchev contrive explanation decision decide impulsively send missile doubt chafe fact soviet strategic inferiority implication german question matter issue united state gilpatric speech october 1961 reveal world lack substance khrushchev ’s claim soviet superiority redress strategic balance april 1962 khrushchev trouble news intermediate range ballistic missile irbms turkey border soviet union operational moment apparently conceive idea place soviet irbms shadow united state cuba raymond garthoff participant event later scholarly analyst argue likely reason soviet leaders’ risk cuban missile venture “ certainly perceive need prevent united state grow strategic superiority compel soviet concession ... share judgment leadership world political perception strategic balance matter soviet union ’s position 1962 need shoring up.”16 fact cuba simultaneously protect likely collateral virtue action student causality argue “ sufficient because ” clear soviet anticipate crisis expect able install missile secretly present united state fait accompli washington acquiesce reluctantly,161,"[1961, 1962, 1962]",1962,3,1975,2000

Kennedy’s aides argued that Cuba was not an offensive threat, that the military buildup was defensive, and that allegations of Soviet missiles were without foundation. Quick to discredit their domestic political opponents, administration leaders discounted the mounting evidence of Khrushchev’s gamble. They were further misled by a deliberate Soviet program of deception, of Soviet assurances it would not put offensive weapons into Cuba, a tactic that continued even after the Americans had discovered the missiles. As late as October 14, McGeorge Bundy, Kennedy’s national security adviser, assured a television audience that there was no evidence the Soviets were preparing an offensive capability in Cuba. That very day the U-2 returned with unmistakable evidence of a missile complex under construction at San Cristobal.

1142,"On October 26, Aleksander Fomin, the senior KGB officer in the Soviet Embassy in Washington, suddenly contacted John Scali, ABC’s State Department reporter, to ask if his friends in the department would be willing to offer a public pledge not to invade Cuba if the Soviets removed the missiles, promised not to reintroduce them, and allowed UN verification. Scali went immediately to a contact in the State Department, who passed the message to the secretary of state and the president. Rusk remembered that an unofficial exchange of views had led to the cease-fire in Korea in 1951 and thought a breakthrough possible. Scali was instructed to inform Fomin that time was short, no more than two days, and given a piece of paper with a message from the “highest levels” in the U.S. government indicating that the Americans saw “real possibilities” in the proposal. It was later alleged by Soviet authorities that Fomin was exploring on his own, but in October 1962, the president and his advisers assumed the terms he proposed came from Moscow. Later that day, Kennedy received a long cable from Khrushchev indicating that he understood the danger of the situation, wanted to avoid conflict, and was prepared to negotiate. He implied that if the United States agreed not to invade Cuba, the missiles could be removed, but he did not specify his terms. Rusk and Llewellyn Thompson concluded that the settlement outlined by Fomin represented Khrushchev’s thoughts, that the Soviets were prepared to back off, that the crisis was over. They guessed that Khrushchev had been struggling with other Soviet leaders eager to challenge the United States and had used Fomin to circumvent them.23","['October 26', '1951', 'no more than two days', 'October 1962', 'Later that day']",october 26 aleksander fomin senior kgb officer soviet embassy washington suddenly contact john scali abc ’s state department reporter ask friend department willing offer public pledge invade cuba soviet remove missile promise reintroduce allow un verification scali go immediately contact state department pass message secretary state president rusk remember unofficial exchange view lead cease fire korea 1951 think breakthrough possible scali instruct inform fomin time short day give piece paper message “ high level ” u.s government indicate american see “ real possibility ” proposal later allege soviet authority fomin explore october 1962 president adviser assume term propose come moscow later day kennedy receive long cable khrushchev indicate understand danger situation want avoid conflict prepared negotiate imply united state agree invade cuba missile remove specify term rusk llewellyn thompson conclude settlement outline fomin represent khrushchev ’s thought soviet prepared crisis guess khrushchev struggle soviet leader eager challenge united state fomin circumvent them.23,152,"[1951, 1962]",1956,2,1975,2000

McNamara was probably right – that strategic parity between the United States and the Soviet Union was inevitable and that the gap was merely being closed sooner rather than later; that Soviet missiles in Cuba were strategically tolerable. By treating the discovery of the missiles as an event of no great import, by accepting Soviet claims that they were defensive, by stressing the enormous retaliatory power of the United States, as Gilpatric had the previous year, the Kennedy administration might have found the rest of the world impressed again by American confidence. It might be argued that the only grave threat posed by the discovery of the missiles was to the political future of the Kennedy administration; that Kennedy’s greatest fear was that the Republican opposition would use the missiles, the existence of which the administration had consistently denied, to ride the Cuban issue to victory in the congressional elections of 1962 and, yet more troubling, in the presidential election of 1964.","['October 1962', 'the previous year', '1962', '1964']",john f. kennedy ’s response missile discover october 1962 bring world step closer disaster unnecessarily mcnamara probably right – strategic parity united state soviet union inevitable gap merely close sooner later soviet missile cuba strategically tolerable treat discovery missile event great import accept soviet claim defensive stress enormous retaliatory power united state gilpatric previous year kennedy administration find rest world impressed confidence argue grave threat pose discovery missile political future kennedy administration kennedy ’s great fear republican opposition use missile existence administration consistently deny ride cuban issue victory congressional election 1962 troubling presidential election 1964,95,"[1962, 1962, 1964]",1963,3,1975,2000
1145,"In the months that followed, the missile crisis came to be seen by many analysts as a watershed in Soviet-American relations. Both American and Soviet leaders generally acted with greater prudence and sought détente. Much of the tension drained out of the confrontation in the last year of Kennedy’s life. A Moscow-Washington “hot line” was set up, permitting direct and immediate communication between the leaders. Agreement was reached on a treaty banning atmospheric nuclear testing by the superpowers. These arguably were not major steps, but they reversed the direction of the previous two years, suggesting that the future might well be one of peaceful coexistence instead of inevitable conflict, that the bomb shelters being built across the United States might not be necessary. They were steps toward building the mutual trust that had never been possible in Stalin’s day and that Khrushchev had precluded by his bluster and deceit. Further improvement of relations would depend on the performance of each country, on the respect and confidence that might develop between its leaders.

1146,"America’s war in Vietnam is the textbook example of great-power arrogance and self-deception, of the abuse and dissipation of wealth and power. Neither American leaders nor American scholars knew or cared much about the people of Vietnam, their history, their culture, their aspirations. Not until the historian Mark Bradley wrote in the late 1990s was the early fascination of Vietnamese intellectuals with American history apparent.1 Vietnam was of no intrinsic importance to the United States. In the years when the French controlled Indochina, they pursued a mercantilist policy, allowing minimal foreign involvement in the region’s economy. American business developed no stake there, and although the area was potentially rich in natural resources, there was nothing there that could not be obtained elsewhere or that the locals could afford to deny to the world market. Similarly, the region was of minimal strategic importance. A case could certainly be made for keeping Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam from being controlled by a presumed adversary, whether Japan in 1941 or China or the Soviet Union in the context of the Cold War. But, of course, a case for containing the influence of an antagonist could be made for every corner of the earth – and outer space as well. Friendly control of what had once been French Indochina was unquestionably desirable. But if Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam were all hostile to the United States, the shift in the world balance of power would be imperceptible. No vital American interest would be threatened. Nonetheless, more than fifty thousand Americans gave their lives in a war in Indochina, as did hundreds of thousands of Cambodians, Laotians, and Vietnamese.","['the late 1990s', 'the years', '1941']",america ’s war vietnam textbook example great power arrogance self deception abuse dissipation wealth power leader scholar know care people vietnam history culture aspiration historian mark bradley write late 1990 early fascination vietnamese intellectual history apparent.1 vietnam intrinsic importance united state year french control indochina pursue mercantilist policy allow minimal foreign involvement region ’s economy business develop stake area potentially rich natural resource obtain local afford deny world market similarly region minimal strategic importance case certainly keep cambodia laos vietnam control presume adversary japan 1941 china soviet union context cold war course case contain influence antagonist corner earth – outer space friendly control french indochina unquestionably desirable cambodia laos vietnam hostile united state shift world balance power imperceptible vital interest threaten nonetheless thousand american give life war indochina hundred thousand cambodian laotian vietnamese,133,"[1990, 1941]",1966,2,1975,2000
1147,"When the war ended, the French returned to Indochina in force, determined to reassert their control. French leaders warned Washington that American opposition to French suppression of the Vietnamese independence movement would alienate the French people, strengthen the French Communist party and, conceivably, drive France into the arms of the Soviets. Ho invoked Thomas Jefferson and the Declaration of Independence, but to no avail. He was, after all, a Communist. More to the point, Vietnam was distant and unimportant. France, on the other hand, might well be a major partner in the new world order American leaders envisaged in the late 1940s; French leaders angered by American opposition to the grandiosity of their imperial vision certainly could undermine American plans for Europe. The United States chose to facilitate the return of French power to Southeast Asia, subordinating traditional American antiimperialism to the exigencies of great-power politics.

1148," When the French failed and were forced to come to terms with Ho’s Vietminh in 1954, the United States determined to do the job right itself. (See Chapter 3.) Eisenhower and Dulles imagined that the Vietnamese still perceived the United States as the beacon of democratic revolution, that the United States could intervene in Vietnam untainted by colonialism and provide a rallying point for Vietnamese nationalism, an umbrella under which Vietnamese who wanted independence not only from France but from international communism would flourish. For the moment, the president and the secretary of state were prepared to concede Vietnam above the seventeenth parallel, where the Vietminh had regrouped, to Ho Chi Minh’s Communist regime. They intended, however, to build a separate, non-Communist nation to the south, where the French, whom they quickly pushed aside, and their collaborators had regrouped. The Americans hoped to use the southern state they would create as a magnet to draw the North out of the Communist orbit.

1149,"Indochina became enormously important to the Eisenhower administration primarily because it was perceived in 1954 as the site of the next round in the battle with the Sino-Soviet bloc. The Communists were seeking to extend their influence everywhere. For the moment they were quiescent in Europe. They lacked a toehold in Africa or the Middle East. They had been checked in Korea, but retained an enormous potential for mischief in East Asia. Chinese support for the Vietminh against the French in 1954, as well as Chinese and Soviet recognition of Ho’s regime in 1950, helped shape the expectations of Eisenhower and his colleagues. They appear to have overlooked Soviet and Chinese indifference to Vietnamese goals at Geneva, Soviet and Chinese pressures on Ho that forced him to concede to the French far more than they had salvaged on the battlefield. Domestic political pressures, from the Republican Right, also informed Eisenhower and Dulles’s conception of the need to draw the line at the seventeenth parallel in Vietnam. Those who had found the Truman administration guilty of losing China did not wish to be charged with losing Indochina.","['1954', '1954', '1950']",indochina enormously important eisenhower administration primarily perceive 1954 site round battle sino soviet bloc communist seek extend influence moment quiescent europe lack toehold africa middle east check korea retain enormous potential mischief east asia chinese support vietminh french 1954 chinese soviet recognition ho ’s regime 1950 help shape expectation eisenhower colleague appear overlook soviet chinese indifference vietnamese goal geneva soviet chinese pressure ho force concede french far salvage battlefield domestic political pressure republican right inform eisenhower dulles ’s conception need draw line seventeenth parallel vietnam find truman administration guilty lose china wish charge lose indochina,95,"[1954, 1954, 1950]",1953,3,1975,2000
1150,"Once Eisenhower had concluded that he had to act in Indochina, he applied his domino theory. Indochina alone may have lacked strategic and economic importance, but if Indochina fell to the Communists, then all of Southeast Asia would follow. Certainly no one would deny the economic and strategic import of all of Southeast Asia, gateway to South Asia and the southwestern Pacific. Laos or Vietnam could each be invested with the value of all of Indochina, Indochina with the value of all of Southeast Asia, Southeast Asia with the value of a large chunk of the globe. Like Truman, Eisenhower seems to have developed his rationale for intervention after he decided to intervene and to have strained to offer something plausible to the American public. In 1956 and 1958 the National Security Council restated the proposition that “the national security of the United States would be endangered by Communist domination of mainland Southeast Asia”; that “the loss to Communist control of any single free country would encourage tendencies toward accommodation by the rest”; that “the loss of the entire area would have a serious adverse impact on the U.S. position elsewhere in the Far East, have severe economic consequences for many nations of the free world ... and could result in severe economic and political pressures on Japan and India for accommodation to the Communist bloc.”3","['1956', '1958']",eisenhower conclude act indochina apply domino theory indochina lack strategic economic importance indochina fall communist southeast asia follow certainly deny economic strategic import southeast asia gateway south asia southwestern pacific laos vietnam invest value indochina indochina value southeast asia southeast asia value large chunk globe like truman eisenhower develop rationale intervention decide intervene strain offer plausible public 1956 1958 national security council restate proposition national security united state endanger communist domination mainland southeast asia ” “ loss communist control single free country encourage tendency accommodation rest ” “ loss entire area adverse impact u.s position far east severe economic consequence nation free world ... result severe economic political pressure japan india accommodation communist bloc.”3,114,"[1956, 1958]",1957,2,1975,2000

1153,"Kennedy’s first emergency in Indochina came in Laos, where Eisenhower’s attempts to create a pro-Western, anti-Communist regime had proven counterproductive. American subversion of the Geneva agreements in support of a right-wing general had triggered an increase in aid to the Communist Pathet Lao from Ho’s regime in Hanoi and a deeper Soviet involvement in Laos. In January 1961, Washington’s man in Laos was on the ropes. Kennedy’s advisers concluded that victory for pro-Western forces was improbable, and that the United States would be fortunate if it could induce the other side to accept a return to a neutral Laos. A major military intervention by the United States was rejected by the president when the Joint Chiefs, disinclined to fight another limited war, demanded freedom to use nuclear weapons and to attack China. Instead, Kennedy ordered the carrier U.S.S. Midway to the Gulf of Siam, sent a Marine detachment to Thailand, put forces on Okinawa on alert, signaling to the Soviets the apparent willingness of the United States to fight rather than allow the Communists to take over Laos.4",['January 1961'],kennedy ’s emergency indochina come laos eisenhower ’s attempt create pro western anti communist regime prove counterproductive subversion geneva agreement support right wing general trigger increase aid communist pathet lao ho ’s regime hanoi deep soviet involvement laos january 1961 washington ’s man laos rope kennedy ’s adviser conclude victory pro western force improbable united state fortunate induce accept return neutral laos major military intervention united state reject president joint chief disinclined fight limit war demand freedom use nuclear weapon attack china instead kennedy order carrier u.s. midway gulf siam send marine detachment thailand force okinawa alert signal soviet apparent willingness united state fight allow communist laos.4,107,[1961],1961,1,1975,2000
1154,"American actions may have frightened their allies as much as they did the Soviets. British prime minister Harold Macmillan thought the issue could be resolved without war “if the Americans do not suddenly run amok.”5 Khrushchev recognized the risk, did not consider total control of Laos worth what it might cost to overcome a major American escalation, and indicated a willingness to negotiate. A cease-fire was arranged in May 1962 and negotiations began shortly thereafter. A Soviet-American agreement on a neutral Laos was reached fourteen months later.","['May 1962', 'fourteen months later']",action frighten ally soviet british prime minister harold macmillan think issue resolve war “ american suddenly run amok.”5 khrushchev recognize risk consider total control laos worth cost overcome major escalation indicate willingness negotiate cease fire arrange 1962 negotiation begin shortly soviet agreement neutral laos reach fourteen month later,48,[1962],1962,1,1975,2000
1155,"Kennedy’s willingness to compromise over Laos did not extend to Vietnam. Throughout the early discussions within the administration of appropriate responses to the crisis in Indochina, the president and his advisers indicated a determination to take their stand in Vietnam. The situation there was retrievable; the Vietnamese protégés of the United States would fight. Initially, Kennedy’s principal concerns were standing up to Khrushchev and preventing a domestic political disaster. He had been deeply troubled by Khrushchev’s strident advocacy of wars of national liberation before and during their meeting in Vienna in June 1961. Subsequently, as the reality of the Sino-Soviet split penetrated their consciousness, he and his advisers were more likely to see the Chinese, working through the Vietnamese Communists, as the evil demons responsible for their distress in Southeast Asia. But no matter whether the initiative came from Moscow, Beijing, or Hanoi, Kennedy was profoundly fearful of being labeled “soft on communism” if he could not prevent a Communist sweep through Indochina. The Republicans had capitalized on the “loss” of China in 1949, and McCarthyism remained a force in the society. Should the Communists prevail in Vietnam, Kennedy’s chances of reelection in 1964 would be slight, the Democratic party would be devastated again, and the forces of reaction would erase the gains of Roosevelt’s New Deal, Truman’s Fair Deal, and whatever he hoped to achieve with his own New Frontier program. Success in Vietnam would teach Khrushchev that the indirect aggression constituted by wars of national liberation did not pay, might erase the embarrassment of failure at the Bay of Pigs, and provide the margin necessary to assure Kennedy of a second term.","['June 1961', '1949', '1964']",kennedy ’s willingness compromise laos extend vietnam early discussion administration appropriate response crisis indochina president adviser indicate determination stand vietnam situation retrievable vietnamese protégé united state fight initially kennedy ’s principal concern stand khrushchev prevent domestic political disaster deeply trouble khrushchev ’s strident advocacy war national liberation meeting vienna june 1961 subsequently reality sino soviet split penetrate consciousness adviser likely chinese work vietnamese communist evil demon responsible distress southeast asia matter initiative come moscow beijing hanoi kennedy profoundly fearful label “ soft communism ” prevent communist sweep indochina republicans capitalize “ loss ” china 1949 mccarthyism remain force society communist prevail vietnam kennedy ’s chance reelection 1964 slight democratic party devastate force reaction erase gain roosevelt ’s new deal truman ’s fair deal hop achieve new frontier program success vietnam teach khrushchev indirect aggression constitute war national liberation pay erase embarrassment failure bay pig provide margin necessary assure kennedy second term,151,"[1961, 1949, 1964]",1958,3,1975,2000

In October 1961, as insurgent successes became more threatening, Kennedy sent Taylor and Rostow to Vietnam to determine whether American troops were necessary. The Taylor-Rostow report, which might have been expected to call for intensifying the counterinsurgency effort, called instead for the introduction of combat forces in the guise of a flood relief team.

He was irritated increasingly, however, by press accounts that suggested the battle in Vietnam was going less well, that the Diem regime was repressive and corrupt, that reports of its strategic successes were exaggerated.

The battle against the insurgents was in the process of becoming an American war likely to cost the United States far more in lives and dollars than control of Vietnam was worth to the United States. In mid-January, Diem’s troops, supported by U.S. planes and helicopters, were battered by a numerically inferior Viet Cong force they had surrounded in the Mekong Delta near Saigon.

The ship was ordered to return to the same area, accompanied by a second U.S. warship, to demonstrate American resolve. On August 4, the North Vietnamese allegedly launched a second attack. The incident came at night, and there was uncertainty about whether it had occurred, but naval authorities assured the president that it had. Almost reflexively, Johnson ordered reprisals against what he called aggression on the high seas.

1169,"On November 3, 1964, the Americans gave Lyndon Johnson an enormous victory over Barry Goldwater. In much of the world, those men and women who concerned themselves with issues of war and peace rejoiced at what they perceived as a victory for peace. In Washington, preparations for war were complete. In Saigon, the generals were playing at musical chairs again, thwarting American efforts to operate from a stable base in the South. The president resisted a powerful argument for commencing systematic bombing of the North presented by McGeorge Bundy and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. The dogs of war strained at their leashes.","['November 3, 1964']",november 3 1964 american give lyndon johnson enormous victory barry goldwater world man woman concern issue war peace rejoice perceive victory peace washington preparation war complete saigon general play musical chair thwart effort operate stable base south president resist powerful argument commence systematic bombing north present mcgeorge bundy secretary defense robert mcnamara dog war strain leash,56,[1964],1964,1,1975,2000
1170,"Suddenly, on February 7, 1965, the Viet Cong attacked an American installation at Pleiku, killing seven Americans and wounding more than one hundred others. Johnson immediately ordered attacks on barracks and staging areas in North Vietnam. A few days later he gave the order to implement the full-scale bombing plan, put into effect February 28. Less than a week later, two battalions of U.S. Marines went ashore at Danang to protect the airfields from which the bombing attacks were being launched. Johnson and his advisers hoped that Hanoi and the Viet Cong could be brought to heel without a major combat role for American ground forces. Rusk and Taylor worried that “white-faced” troops would be counterproductive; that they would be viewed with hostility by the local people, discredit the side on which they fought, and have trouble distinguishing between friendly and unfriendly villagers. But intelligence reports soon indicated that the bombing had not affected Hanoi’s will, that North Vietnamese regular army troops were beginning to cross into the South. On April 1, the president approved the use of American troops for offensive operations. On election day, in November 1964, there had been 25,000 American military men and women in Vietnam. In July 1965 there were 75,000. In November, a year after the election, there were 165,000 and reports that more were on the way. American boys were trying to do what candidate Lyndon Johnson had promised Asian boys would be allowed to do for themselves.

1171,"Unhappiness with the American role in Vietnam manifested itself as early as March 1965 as student activists, religious pacifists, and academics specializing in Southeast Asian affairs began to challenge the administration. The first of the antiwar demonstrations was mounted in Washington in April. In May there was a national teach-in involving over a hundred campuses across the country. Opposition to the war grew in intensity as the Americanization of the struggle continued, slowly drawing more and more ordinary middle-class Americans into the antiwar coalition. Attempts by Johnson and his advisers to counter criticism were often disingenuous, increasing rather than allaying doubts. The president’s gift for hyperbole served him poorly.","['as early as March 1965', 'April', 'May']",unhappiness role vietnam manifest early march 1965 student activist religious pacifist academic specialize southeast asian affair begin challenge administration antiwar demonstration mount washington april national teach involve campus country opposition war grow intensity americanization struggle continue slowly draw ordinary middle class american antiwar coalition attempt johnson adviser counter criticism disingenuous increase allay doubt president ’s gift hyperbole serve poorly,59,[1965],1965,1,1975,2000
1172,"One critical step toward the undermining of Johnson’s credibility was his handling of an unrelated crisis in the Dominican Republic in April and May of 1965. The deviousness with which he justified sending in the Marines cost him the trust of a valued and powerful ally, Senator J. William Fulbright (D.-Ark.), chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, and much of the foreign policy establishment. Fearing that Communists might be on the verge of turning the Dominican Republic into another Cuba, Johnson responded with characteristic vigor, sending first a small detachment of Marines and then more than 20,000 soldiers to suppress a mutiny by democratically inclined officers against a conservative military junta. The United States intervened in the internal affairs of the small Caribbean country, and the president greatly exaggerated both the danger to Americans resident there and of Communist involvement. Skepticism about Johnson’s shifting explanations and distaste for his eagerness to assume imperial responsibilities stimulated Fulbright and others to reexamine policy toward Vietnam. They were dismayed by what they found.","['April', 'May of 1965']","critical step undermining johnson ’s credibility handling unrelated crisis dominican republic april 1965 deviousness justify send marine cost trust valued powerful ally senator j. william fulbright d .- ark chairman committee foreign relation foreign policy establishment fear communist verge turn dominican republic cuba johnson respond characteristic vigor send small detachment marine 20,000 soldier suppress mutiny democratically inclined officer conservative military junta united state intervene internal affair small caribbean country president greatly exaggerate danger american resident communist involvement skepticism johnson ’s shift explanation distaste eagerness assume imperial responsibility stimulate fulbright reexamine policy vietnam dismay find",94,[1965],1965,1,1975,2000
1173,"Between January 28 and February 18, 1966, Fulbright held six televised hearings on the war. Reflecting the hardening of the administration’s commitment to a non-Communist South Vietnam, Rusk insisted that the war was an act of outside aggression by the Hanoi regime, that the United States had commitments to repel that aggression. He argued that what was at stake was not merely Vietnam, but the credibility of American commitments all over the world: “We must make clear that the United States keeps its word wherever it is pledged.”14 Presumably, if the United States did not fight in Vietnam, the whole postwar edifice of collective security would collapse. Others spoke in support of the administration’s policy, but of greatest consequence was the appearance of George Kennan in opposition. Consistent with his low regard for the importance of developing countries, Kennan argued that the war was foolish and might well lead to a disastrous encounter with China. He insisted that withdrawal – and, by implication, Communist control of the South – would not hurt any major American interest. The televised hearings, highlighting the doubts of prominent and highly respected observers, assured millions of Americans of the respectability of dissent. Even Robert Kennedy and other intimates of the late president openly criticized the administration.","['Between January 28 and February 18, 1966', '–']",january 28 february 18 1966 fulbright hold televise hearing war reflect hardening administration ’s commitment non communist south vietnam rusk insist war act outside aggression hanoi regime united state commitment repel aggression argue stake merely vietnam credibility commitment world “ clear united state keep word pledged.”14 presumably united state fight vietnam postwar edifice collective security collapse speak support administration ’s policy great consequence appearance george kennan opposition consistent low regard importance develop country kennan argue war foolish lead disastrous encounter china insist withdrawal – implication communist control south – hurt major interest televise hearing highlight doubt prominent highly respected observer assure million american respectability dissent robert kennedy intimate late president openly criticize administration,113,[1966],1966,1,1975,2000

The CIA reported, however, that “short of a major invasion or nuclear attack, there is probably no level of air or naval actions against North Vietnam which Hanoi has determined in advance would be so intolerable that the war had to be stopped.”16 The Communist regime was confident of victory, and the Pentagon’s own analysts contended that more American troops would do little good and probably great harm, especially to the economy of South Vietnam.","['May 1967', 'three years']","1967 436,000 troop vietnam military talk need 565,000 win year 665,000 win cia report “ short major invasion nuclear attack probably level air naval action north vietnam hanoi determine advance intolerable war stopped.”16 communist regime confident victory pentagon ’s analyst contend troop little good probably great harm especially economy south vietnam",51,[1967],1967,1,1975,2000
1177,"The United States could not win and could not seem to end the war. Popular dissatisfaction grew. As American casualties multiplied, demonstrations, draft resistance, and desertions from the military increased. In the field the phenomenon of “fragging,” of the murder of American officers by men resisting being led into battle, spread ominously. In July 1967, riots exploded in Newark and Detroit. Scores were killed, thousands arrested, millions of dollars in property damage sustained. The anger of the black ghettos was not related directly to the war in Vietnam, but the riots added to the sense of a society breaking apart. There were demands that funds being used to kill in Vietnam be used for saving lives at home, for a War on Poverty. The war was now costing the American people $20 billion per year. It was becoming clear that the government lacked the resources for both the Great Society and Vietnam. In August, Johnson averted financial disaster by agreeing to a 10 percent surcharge on income taxes. The response in the public opinion polls was immediate: For the first time a plurality of Americans, most of those with an opinion, thought the war in Vietnam was a mistake. Pressure on the United States to end the war intensified. Even the pope called for suspension of the bombing.

1178,"Johnson’s reaction was to start 1968 with a new team, on which there were no doubters in evidence. The military braced for a major North Vietnamese attack on a U.S. Marine garrison near the Laotian border, at Khesanh, perceived as a replay of the 1954 battle of Dienbienphu. There the Americans intended to demonstrate to the Vietnamese the difference between the United States and France. American military leaders were convinced they were on the verge of victory: All they needed was another 100,000, perhaps 200,000 men and a little more freedom to attack the North. They assured the president that the Viet Cong had been weakened to the point where they lacked offensive capability without support from the North.","['1968', '1954']","johnson ’s reaction start 1968 new team doubter evidence military brace major north vietnamese attack u.s marine garrison near laotian border khesanh perceive replay 1954 battle dienbienphu american intend demonstrate vietnamese difference united state france military leader convince verge victory need 100,000 200,000 man little freedom attack north assure president viet cong weaken point lack offensive capability support north",59,"[1968, 1954]",1961,2,1975,2000

But there was reason for satisfaction with the Vietnamization policy. The performance of Saigon’s forces improved markedly, largely because the Viet Cong had suffered enormous casualties during their Tet offensive, and by 1970, the countryside was securer than at any time since the insurgency began. The balance of forces in the South had shifted in favor of the government. More and more the burden of fighting Saigon and its American supporters fell to North Vietnamese regulars. Supplied with Soviet SAM ground-to-air missiles that took a heavy toll of American bombers, the Northerners resisted American pressures.

Johnson had refused, but Nixon immediately authorized secret bombing raids in 1969. The secret, of course, was to be kept from the American people, not from the recipients of the bombs. Early in 1970, to the delight of the American government, Sihanouk was overthrown by a military coup led by officers friendly to the United States. In May, American troops invaded neutral Cambodia, determined to destroy the Vietnamese sanctuaries.

In February 1971, South Vietnamese forces supported by American planes and helicopters struck at North Vietnamese sanctuaries in Laos, another major expansion of the war – and another disaster. Apparently Hanoi’s intelligence operatives had advance notice of the operation and hit the South Vietnamese hard, using some of their new Soviet tanks. Saigon’s troops suffered a casualty rate of 50 percent and fled ignominiously from the battlefield, in some instances clinging to the skids of helicopters. At home, Lieutenant William Calley was convicted for his role in the massacre of women and children at the village of My Lai, and other veterans came forward to reveal that such atrocities were not isolated incidents. Then, in June 1971, the New York Times began publishing a secret Defense Department documentary history of American decision making in Vietnam, revealing many of the ways the Kennedy and Johnson administrations had deceived the American people. Polls taken soon afterward indicated that 71 percent of the American people thought it had been a mistake to go to war in Vietnam. Even more striking was the fact that 58 percent thought the war was immoral.

They assumed that they could isolate North Vietnam and force it to come to terms. The initial response from Hanoi, in March 1972, was a conventional attack across the demilitarized zone that caught the Americans and their Vietnamese protégés by complete surprise.

The Saigon regime rejected the agreement, but the exigencies of the election campaign led Kissinger, a few days before the voters decided, to announce, “Peace is at hand.” His aides readily admitted that they could have achieved the same agreement at any time in the previous year: The announcement was designed to help bury George McGovern, the Democrats’ peace candidate.","['the fall of 1972', 'a few days', 'the previous year']",renew military stalemate additional concession pressure soviet chinese ally eager improve relation united state chapter 7 realization nixon likely reelect finally lead hanoi accept diplomatic arrangement short victory fall 1972 saigon regime reject agreement exigency election campaign lead kissinger day voter decide announce “ peace hand aide readily admit achieve agreement time previous year announcement design help bury george mcgovern democrats’ peace candidate,63,[1972],1972,1,1975,2000

At the same time massive supplies of military equipment were delivered to the Saigon regime, with Nixon’s personal assurance that the United States would return if the North violated the agreement.

1186,"Nixon continued efforts to sustain Saigon after the peace agreement led to the withdrawal of American forces, but the Watergate scandal soon crippled him and ended, at least temporarily, the “imperial presidency.” Congress reasserted itself in foreign affairs and restricted the president’s power to reinvolve the United States in the war in Vietnam. American support for the Saigon regime declined and with it so did one of the regime’s principal reasons for existing. Although the military initiative appeared to rest with the South Vietnamese army throughout 1973, by mid-1974 operations had to be curtailed for lack of adequate supplies. The departure of the Americans and the reduction of American aid affected morale in Saigon adversely, and the will to fight had ebbed palpably by early 1975. Enormous numbers of government troops deserted. When the North Vietnamese struck in March 1975 with the first in what was supposed to be a two-year series of major attacks, the South Vietnamese army panicked and then disintegrated. Calls for help from the United States were to no avail. Richard Nixon was gone in disgrace, and his secret promises to the authorities in Saigon could not be honored by President Gerald Ford. A few weeks later the fighting stopped. The Communists controlled all of Vietnam, and Saigon became Ho Chi Minh City. After a war of roughly thirty years, the Vietnamese revolution had triumphed over the French, the Americans, and all internal opposition. Unhappily for Washington, the revolution was dominated by Communists, by men and women with ties to America’s adversaries in Moscow and Beijing, by men and women who had watched their countrymen suffer terribly because of American intervention in their affairs.

1188,"The dollar had been weak since the late 1950s and balance-of-payments deficits had troubled Kennedy, but the deficit did not get out of control until 1964. After Eisenhower, no president gave adequate consideration to the cost of American security. Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon proudly refused to put a price tag on the foreign policy goals they chose to pursue. Balance-of-payments concerns were consistently subordinated to security concerns. There was a sharp increase in the rate of inflation in the 1960s as the government printed more and more dollars to pay for its imperial activities. Both the Johnson administration and the Nixon administration tried to export the cost of the war, export inflation, to their trading partners. The French rebelled in 1965, demanding gold for the dollars they held, and the British and Germans objected to American international monetary policy in 1971. The world had grown tired of collecting inflated American dollars in return for protection against a Soviet threat they perceived as much diminished or to support an American war in Vietnam of which most Europeans disapproved. Tensions grew as currency issues began to compete with security concerns in the minds of allied leaders. The political scientist Robert Gilpin explains that “for both foreign policy and domestic reasons, successive American administrations pursued expansionary and inflationary monetary policies that eventually undermined the dollar and destabilized the monetary system.

1189,"The inflated dollar priced U.S. goods out of overseas markets, and, in 1971, the United States ran its first trade balance deficit of the century. In the course of the year, to staunch the outflow of gold, the Nixon administration refused to redeem dollars for gold. Nixon’s advisers chose to end the dollar’s status as a reserve currency and to destroy the Bretton Woods system Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes had designed in the 1940s, which had brought striking prosperity to those who participated in it. Many of the economic problems facing the United States in the late 1960s and 1970s would have existed without the war, the result of inflationary domestic programs to provide jobs and services to the American people, but they were exacerbated by the billions spent in Vietnam. Stagflation, a stagnant economy with rapidly rising prices, hit the United States in the 1970s. Germany and Japan, denied the opportunity to play the great-power game by defeat in World War II, became the principal beneficiaries of American decline. The Japanese, who spent 99 percent of their research-and-development budget on civilian production, easily captured markets from the United States, which devoted 50 percent of its research-and-development expenditures to armaments.

The war drained American resources, exacerbated tensions within American society, alienated NATO allies as well as Third World countries, and heightened Vietnamese dependence on the Soviet Union.

First, the president announced his opening to China without consulting the Japanese, who, out of loyalty to their American allies, had long resisted internal pressures to recognize the Beijing government. Second, Nixon unilaterally declared that dollars could no longer be converted into gold and that a 10 percent surcharge would be levied on all imports. Japan was forced to revalue the yen and to limit exports to the United States. Economic issues, long subordinated to security concerns, were becoming paramount in Japanese-American affairs.

Nasser, attempting to intimidate the Israelis with the threat of a two-front war, demanded the withdrawal of UN peacekeeping forces, which separated his troops from the Israelis, and sent his forces toward the Gulf of Aqaba, where they could harass the vital port of Elat. Thus provoked, the Israelis attacked preemptively and, in what came to be known as the Six-Day War, routed Egyptian, Jordanian, and Syrian troops, seizing control of the Sinai Peninsula, the west bank of the Jordan River and Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. At that point, when the Israelis seemed likely to continue on to Damascus, the Soviets threatened to intervene, a hardly credible threat given the limits of Soviet ability to project its power into the Mediterranean and the presence of the American Sixth Fleet.

They worked assiduously to incite the Arab world against the United States, disseminating lies about the American role in the conflict and applauding the oil embargo when it finally came.

Their game plan for Indochina and détente could not be executed. They could not deliver on promises to their allies in Indochina or their adversaries in Moscow. Once again, the United States served as an illustration of the strong-state, weak-government paradigm. The Nixon administration and its replacement, the administration of Gerald Ford, successive governments of the most powerful state in the world, were not strong enough to act as they wished in world affairs. In Nixon’s mind, the United States was in danger of becoming “a pitiful, helpless giant.”","['1973', '–']",1973 congress pass war power act design restrain president ’s use military force declaration war – demonstrate determination override presidential veto year congress order end merciless bombing cambodia pass law prevent troop return vietnam signal intent hold trade relation soviet union hostage soviet performance human right issue specifically freedom soviet jews emigrate limit ability nixon kissinger manage foreign affair bring collapse intricate schema contrive game plan indochina détente execute deliver promise ally indochina adversary moscow united state serve illustration strong state weak government paradigm nixon administration replacement administration gerald ford successive government powerful state world strong act wish world affair nixon ’s mind united state danger “ pitiful helpless giant,110,[1973],1973,1,1975,2000
1213,"Chinese-American relations also fell victim to Nixon’s disgrace. Liaison offices had been opened in Beijing and Washington with the expectation that they quickly would be elevated to embassies, that the United States would abandon the pretense that Taiwan was China, disengage from Chiang’s regime, and establish normal diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic. Fighting to stave off impeachment, the president became increasingly dependent on the support of conservative lawmakers, many of whom were longtime supporters of Chiang’s “Free China,” implacable enemies of “Red China.” Unable to risk alienating them, Nixon chose not to abrogate the defense treaty with Taiwan. Recognition of Mao’s China was not quite equal in importance to the preservation of Richard Nixon’s presidency. His successor, Gerald Ford, likewise needed the support of the Republican right wing, especially after he was challenged for party leadership by Ronald Reagan, long the first choice of the Right. Recognition of the People’s Republic would have to wait. And in China, American delays undermined advocates of rapprochement with the United States and a dying Zhou Enlai lost control of policy.

1214,"Perhaps the most serious problem the United States faced in the 1970s was posed by the decline in its economic power, especially as aggravated by the policies of the Johnson and Nixon administrations. It is important to stress that the decline was relative, that although the United States ceased to dominate the international economic order as it had in the first two decades after World War II, it remained an enormously wealthy and powerful country. The American economy was troubled and mismanaged but never in danger of collapse.","['the 1970s', 'the first two decades']",problem united state face 1970s pose decline economic power especially aggravate policy johnson nixon administration important stress decline relative united state cease dominate international economic order decade world war ii remain enormously wealthy powerful country economy troubled mismanage danger collapse,40,[1970],1970,1,1975,2000
1215,"The American economy had been the engine that drove the nations linked to it to extraordinary prosperity in the 1950s and 1960s. The United States had accepted the imperial burden of protecting its friends and allies while they reconstructed or developed their economies. The patchwork system that evolved out of Bretton Woods (see Chapter 1) had worked. Real wealth had increased among the countries participating in the American-led liberal order. But, by 1960, a number of problems – some systemic, some specific to the United States – emerged. First, European countries and Japan recovered from the impact of the war and became more competitive and more assertive in their trade policies. They were prepared to continue cooperation with an American-led system but demanded a voice in its direction. Second, the American people became increasingly sensitive to the inequities within their society, the persistence of poverty amid plenty. The Kennedy administration, faced with a serious balance-of-payments problem, a declining trade surplus, and demands for social justice at home, conceived a series of innovative steps to expand the economy, but a simultaneous increase in defense and foreign assistance spending precluded success. Keynesian methods of achieving full employment might well have succeeded in a quiescent world; added to the expense required to meet the challenge of a Khrushchev-invigorated Soviet Union, they meant excessive federal deficits, inflation, and a balance-of-payments deficit that threatened the stability of the international economic order established at Bretton Woods.","['the 1950s and 1960s', '1960']",economy engine drive nation link extraordinary prosperity 1950 1960 united state accept imperial burden protect friend ally reconstruct develop economy patchwork system evolve bretton wood chapter 1 work real wealth increase country participate lead liberal order 1960 number problem – systemic specific united state – emerge european country japan recover impact war competitive assertive trade policy prepared continue cooperation lead system demand voice direction second people increasingly sensitive inequity society persistence poverty amid plenty kennedy administration face balance payment problem decline trade surplus demand social justice home conceive series innovative step expand economy simultaneous increase defense foreign assistance spending preclude success keynesian method achieve employment succeed quiescent world add expense require meet challenge khrushchev invigorate soviet union mean excessive federal deficit inflation balance payment deficit threaten stability international economic order establish bretton wood,133,[1960],1960,1,1975,2000
1216,"Nixon, Kissinger, and their aides much preferred to focus their attention and hone their skills on the pursuit of political and military advantage over their adversaries. But they were confronted with a politically damaging recession in 1969 and concluded that inflationary tactics, including devaluation of the dollar, were essential. The United States had run out of devices for maintaining the Bretton Woods system. The Germans and Japanese were resisting American pressure to revalue the mark and the yen, unwilling to allow the United States to devalue the dollar, and gold was leaving the country at alarming rates. The huge balance-of-payments deficit meant foreigners held more dollars than could be redeemed in gold. The system had always been costly to the United States. but it had borne the cost for political reasons, to enable its friends to reconstruct and to preserve vital security relations. By 1971, Nixon had decided the price was too high, the system too restrictive. He was confident that Germany and Japan would not stray and that the United States could change the rules and destroy the system at acceptable cost. Contrary to the commitment to convertibility, the president decreed that the gold would not be given in exchange for the excess dollars of countries with balance-of-payments surpluses. He placed a surcharge on import duties to meet protectionist demands in Congress and instituted wage and price controls in an effort to control inflation. Before the year was out, agreement was reached on a devaluation of the dollar. These steps, however disruptive of the international economic order, helped stimulate a boom in the United States in 1972, easing Nixon’s path to reelection. Again, it should be noted that despite the decline of American economic power in the 1960s, the United States remained strong enough to determine the shape of the new international economic order. In order to increase its freedom of maneuver, the United States wrecked the system it had created.14","['1969', '1971', 'the year', '1972', 'the 1960s']",nixon kissinger aide prefer focus attention hone skill pursuit political military advantage adversary confront politically damaging recession 1969 conclude inflationary tactic include devaluation dollar essential united state run device maintain bretton wood system german japanese resist pressure revalue mark yen unwilling allow united state devalue dollar gold leave country alarming rate huge balance payment deficit mean foreigner hold dollar redeem gold system costly united state bear cost political reason enable friend reconstruct preserve vital security relation 1971 nixon decide price high system restrictive confident germany japan stray united state change rule destroy system acceptable cost contrary commitment convertibility president decree gold give exchange excess dollar country balance payment surplus place surcharge import duty meet protectionist demand congress institute wage price control effort control inflation year agreement reach devaluation dollar step disruptive international economic order help stimulate boom united state 1972 ease nixon ’s path reelection note despite decline economic power 1960 united state remain strong determine shape new international economic order order increase freedom maneuver united state wreck system created.14,170,"[1969, 1971, 1972, 1960]",1968,4,1975,2000
1217,"But in the new era that began in the 1970s, the United States no longer dominated the international financial system. In 1971, the United States recorded its first balance-of-trade deficit of the twentieth century. Increasingly, it required the acquiescence of Germany and Japan, German and Japanese capital, to maintain domestic prosperity and to project its military power across the world. Both countries became increasingly assertive, the Germans on monetary issues and the Japanese on trade. Gradually American leaders discovered they no longer had the freedom of action their predecessors had enjoyed in the quarter of a century following World War II. Increasingly, the United States needed foreign capital to maintain the living standards of its people and its influence abroad, and that capital did not come without strings. German and Japanese ideas about what the United States did at home and abroad had to be considered.

Until then the United States had controlled the world energy market as well as the monetary system. But as American automobiles and industry consumed more and more of the world’s oil each year, American reserves declined. The United States, for the first time, became dependent on foreign suppliers. It could no longer use its own once vast petroleum reserves to keep world prices down, and to assure Americans an endless supply of inexpensive fuel. In the midst of the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, the presumably friendly shah of Iran extorted an enormous price increase while Arab suppliers withheld shipments, and the Saudis replaced Americans as the arbiters of world oil prices. Unable to assure its friends of essential supplies at affordable prices, the United States lost the ability to influence their policies, as was exemplified by American inability to prevent the Japanese from shifting from a pro-Israel to a pro-Arab policy in 1973.","['the mid-1970s', 'each year', '1973', '1973']",relative decline power underscore oil crisis mid-1970 induce organization petroleum export country opec united state control world energy market monetary system automobile industry consume world ’s oil year reserve decline united state time dependent foreign supplier longer use vast petroleum reserve world price assure american endless supply inexpensive fuel midst arab israeli war 1973 presumably friendly shah iran extort enormous price increase arab supplier withhold shipment saudis replace american arbiter world oil price unable assure friend essential supply affordable price united state lose ability influence policy exemplify inability prevent japanese shift pro israel pro arab policy 1973,97,"[1970, 1973, 1973]",1972,3,1975,2000
1219,"The year Nixon resigned the presidency, 1974, was a particularly bad year for the American economy. Gerald Ford entered the White House confronted with a stagnant economy and a high rate of inflation, the unusual combination economists called stagflation. Ford and Kissinger found the American people much more concerned about jobs and the cost of living than competing with the Soviets on the periphery. With the collapse of the Saigon regime in 1975, there was a widespread unwillingness, in Congress and across the country, to throw scarce resources into endlessly draining, relatively unimportant, probably hopeless causes abroad. The war in Vietnam had denied Americans the Great Society Lyndon Johnson had promised. It was hard for them to imagine any place in the Third World that was worth a further lowering of their standard of living.","['1974', '1975']",year nixon resign presidency 1974 particularly bad year economy gerald ford enter white house confront stagnant economy high rate inflation unusual combination economist call stagflation ford kissinger find people concerned job cost live compete soviet periphery collapse saigon regime 1975 widespread unwillingness congress country throw scarce resource endlessly drain relatively unimportant probably hopeless cause abroad war vietnam deny american great society lyndon johnson promise hard imagine place world worth lowering standard living,72,"[1974, 1975]",1974,2,1975,2000
1220,"Kissinger was deeply troubled by the message that American ennui sent to the Soviets. He never doubted that the Soviets would seek any advantage they could; that an indication that the United States was withdrawing from the field would be perceived in Moscow as an opportunity to expand Soviet influence without risk. Détente depended on the stick as well as the carrot. Congressional action on trade and credit issues had left him little in the way of carrots. Now it began to appear that the administration lacked the support it required to continue three decades of containment. When in May 1975, Cambodian Communists seized an American vessel, the Mayaguez, the Ford administration reacted muscularly, sending in the Marines. The operation proved to have been unnecessary. The captives had been released before it began, and more lives were lost among the would-be rescuers than there had been prisoners. But Ford and Kissinger had demonstrated, to their satisfaction, that the United States was not to be trifled with.","['three decades', 'May 1975']",kissinger deeply trouble message ennui send soviet doubt soviet seek advantage indication united state withdraw field perceive moscow opportunity expand soviet influence risk détente depend stick carrot congressional action trade credit issue leave little way carrot begin appear administration lack support require continue decade containment 1975 cambodian communist seize vessel mayaguez ford administration react muscularly send marine operation prove unnecessary captive release begin life lose rescuer prisoner ford kissinger demonstrate satisfaction united state trifle,74,[1975],1975,1,2000,2000
1221,"Angola, an African nation in which the United States had little interest, emerged as the major point of contention in Soviet-American relations during the Ford administration. A bewildering array of indigenous groups, each with external sources of support, had been seeking to wrest independence from the Portuguese, who abandoned the field after their own revolution in the spring of 1974. As might be expected, there was a Marxist-Leninist organization, the MPLA, supported primarily by Cuba, with intermittent support from the Soviet Union, the Congo, Algeria, the Communist party of Portugal, and some Western European governments. A second group, the FNLA, won the support of an odd assortment of backers, including the CIA, Zaire, North Korea, China, Algeria, Morocco, Romania, Libya, India, several Western European governments, the Ford Foundation, the AFL-CIO, and, eventually, South Africa. A third important force, UNITA, also received aid from China and wooed South Africa.

In 1977, Cuba and the Soviets backed different factions within the Angolan regime, with the Cuban-backed government forces prevailing over pro-Soviet dissidents – with the help of Cuban tanks.

Eager to bloody the Vietnamese for challenging Chinese influence in Cambodia, Deng wanted an American connection that would neutralize the Soviets, reduce the possibility of Soviet intervention when China attacked Vietnam. Whenever and wherever they could, Chinese leaders attempted to stir trouble between the Soviet Union and the West.

Certainly Vance was genuinely interested in regaining momentum toward accommodation with the Soviet Union, and Brzezinski thought that Brezhnev’s willingness to meet Carter and sign the treaty was evidence of the success of his efforts to intimidate the Soviets. SALT II was not a great breakthrough in arms control, but most of the professionals who examined it thought it better crafted than SALT I and very much in the interest of the United States. The Soviets, for their part, had an intense need to reduce military expenditures. Although Brezhnev and the other party elders seemed unmindful of the alarms being sounded by Soviet midlevel analysts, the economy of their country was beginning to disintegrate and the cost of their empire was greater than their people could bear. At the meeting Carter embraced Brezhnev and managed not to berate him about human rights violations.

1238,"Soviet actions in the Third World and the Kremlin’s suppression of dissidents at home, combined with Carter’s inept leadership, allowed Senator Jackson and other anti-Soviet elements in American society to seize the initiative. In late summer 1979, Frank Church (D.-Idaho), a senator friendly to détente, inadvertently doomed the SALT II treaty by calling attention to a Soviet combat brigade in Cuba and demanding its immediate removal. Church, widely considered too liberal for his constituents, was attempting to ward off conservative attacks in his fight for reelection. In fact, the brigade had been in Cuba for years with the acquiescence of the American government. When Carter, in response to the domestic political furor caused by Church’s revelation, demanded that the Soviets withdraw their troops, it was Brezhnev’s turn to be outraged. The Soviets had done nothing wrong. They had honored their promise not to reinforce their forces in Cuba. They were being asked to retreat from a position they had held since the early 1960s to assist the American president with his domestic political problems. They refused. Carter and the Soviets thus gave additional ammunition to the anti-SALT forces in the Senate.25","['late summer 1979', 'years', 'the early 1960s']",soviet action world kremlin ’s suppression dissident home combine carter ’s inept leadership allow senator jackson anti soviet element society seize initiative late summer 1979 frank church d .- idaho senator friendly détente inadvertently doom salt ii treaty call attention soviet combat brigade cuba demand immediate removal church widely consider liberal constituent attempt ward conservative attack fight reelection fact brigade cuba year acquiescence government carter response domestic political furor cause church ’s revelation demand soviet withdraw troop brezhnev ’s turn outrage soviet wrong honor promise reinforce force cuba ask retreat position hold early 1960 assist president domestic political problem refuse carter soviet give additional ammunition anti salt force senate.25,109,"[1979, 1960]",1970,2,1975,2000

The shah of Iran, reestablished in power by the CIA-directed coup of 1953, had fled in January 1979, as forces hostile to his far from benevolent rule became increasingly threatening. Hopes for a moderate democratic successor regime were quickly buried by powerful Islamic fundamentalists who looked to the Ayatollah Khomeini as their leader. In November, Khomeini’s followers seized the American Embassy and took those inside it hostage, ultimately holding fifty-seven of them for fourteen months, for the remainder of Carter’s presidency. The inability of the Carter administration to obtain the freedom of the hostages, through negotiations or a bizarre rescue attempt, intensified public frustration with the president’s leadership – or lack thereof. Gulliver tormented by the Lilliputians was not an image of their country acceptable to Americans. They wanted their leader to act forcefully to command the respect due the world’s greatest power.

1240,"In December, the Soviets gave Carter an opportunity to act assertively, to assume the mantle of greatness Brzezinski held out for him, at the cost of détente. In Afghanistan, the Communist regime that had come to power in April 1978 was disintegrating, partly under pressure of Islamic fundamentalist opposition, but largely because of ethnic factionalism within the Afghan Communist party. Soviet advisers and pressures had failed to ameliorate the situation. Unrest in a nation on its border, among people ethnically related to restive Soviet peoples in Central Asia, boded ill. The triumph of Islamic fundamentalism in Iran threatened Soviet interests as well as American. Whereas the American concern was primarily for control of Persian Gulf oil, the Soviets feared for the security of their border regions. Some analysts feared Afghan leaders would reprise Sadat’s betrayal and turn to the United States. Few foresaw how intensely the international community would react, and fewer still anticipated the forceful American response. When political pressure failed, the Soviets resorted to force, another classic example of the arrogance of power. The mighty Red army, feared all over Europe and America, marched into Afghanistan to teach what Lyndon Johnson would have called a “pissant country” not to defy the will of a superpower.

The army, no matter how brutally it performed its duties, could not crush Afghan guerrilla forces, supplied primarily by the Chinese and Americans. The economy, ramshackle at best, could not stand the strain of subsidies to allies like Cuba and Vietnam, the price of empire. And now there was likely to be a new and costly arms race with the United States. Fearful of Soviet communism, Americans had long exaggerated the threat posed by the Soviet Union. In 1980, many Americans perceived the Soviet Union as on the offensive, poised to achieve its goal of world domination. Brezhnev and the other party ancients reveled in that vision, but the reality was a regime everywhere on the defensive.

The euphoria of Nixon’s openings to Moscow and Beijing in 1972, the widespread hopes for peace, were dashed in the closing months of the Carter administration. But the forces propelling the superpowers toward accommodation remained powerful. Foremost among them were the domestic economic realities from which no American or Soviet leader could escape. The empires built at such great cost in the years since World War II had placed unacceptable burdens on both societies. America’s relative decline had begun in the 1960s, but the Americans had achieved a standard of living that remained out of the reach of the people of the Soviet Union. The agricultural and industrial foundation of American power remained stronger than anything the Soviet system could construct.

1247,"Despite the extraordinary military buildup over which he presided and the confrontational rhetoric for which he was notorious, Reagan had an intense emotional horror of nuclear weapons. He was appalled when he realized that American security was dependent on the concept of deterrence, on having a sufficient number of strategic nuclear weapons, deployed at sea, in the air, and on land, to deter a first strike by the Soviets. In theory, no matter how the Soviets attacked, American weapons sufficient to retaliate and destroy the Soviet Union would survive, and vice versa. The security of both superpowers had come to rest on the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction. A fraction of each side’s strategic force would survive a first strike and destroy the other; there was, therefore, no point to an attack. Deterrence had been central to American defense strategy at least since the Soviets developed a credible strategic force in the 1960s, but it was not good enough for Ronald Reagan. He equated nuclear war with Armageddon, the destruction of the world. He wanted nuclear weapons eliminated rather than controlled. Short of their elimination, he wanted some means to prevent them from being used against Americans. In the 1940 movie Murder in the Air, Reagan, as Brass Bancroft, had protected an American secret weapon, an “inertia projector” capable of destroying enemy planes before they could reach their targets. He would have to do something like that again to stave off the apocalypse.

1249,"Similarly, the president found he could not so easily dispense with arms control negotiations. In response to European anxieties over new Soviet intermediate-range missile deployments in the late 1970s, Carter had agreed to station a new generation of American Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe in the 1980s. Unabashed by the threat their weapons posed to Western Europe, the Soviets were outraged by the threat the proposed American deployment constituted to them. They organized a major propaganda campaign against it among Europeans. Indeed, keeping the new American missiles out of Europe became the principal task of Soviet diplomacy in 1981 and 1982. To protect themselves from antimissile political activists, the European potential host governments needed to demonstrate a good faith effort to achieve security through arms reduction: They needed to have the United States negotiate with the Soviets for the removal or reduction of intermediate missiles from Europe prior to accepting the necessity of deploying new weapons. Reagan had no choice and he sent his negotiators to talk to their Soviet counterparts in what were known as INF (intermediate-range nuclear force) talks. Shortly afterward, Reagan was forced by Congress to back away from his refusal to resume strategic arms limitation talks (SALT). He disguised his retreat by calling these strategic arms reduction talks (START). His predecessors had been content to control the arms race by agreeing to limits on their new weapons. He claimed he would reverse the process by eliminating weapons.3","['the late 1970s', 'the 1980s', '1981', '1982']",similarly president find easily dispense arm control negotiation response european anxiety new soviet intermediate range missile deployment late 1970 carter agree station new generation pershing cruise missile europe 1980s unabashed threat weapon pose western europe soviet outrage threat propose deployment constitute organize major propaganda campaign europeans keep new missile europe principal task soviet diplomacy 1981 1982 protect antimissile political activist european potential host government need demonstrate good faith effort achieve security arm reduction need united state negotiate soviet removal reduction intermediate missile europe prior accept necessity deploy new weapon reagan choice send negotiator talk soviet counterpart know inf intermediate range nuclear force talk shortly afterward reagan force congress away refusal resume strategic arm limitation talk salt disguise retreat call strategic arm reduction talk start predecessor content control arm race agree limit new weapon claim reverse process eliminate weapons.3,138,"[1970, 1980, 1981, 1982]",1978,4,2000,2000

In particular, the Reagan administration demanded that Europeans stop assistance to the Soviet construction of a gas pipeline to facilitate the sale of Soviet natural gas to Western Europe.

The years of détente had been good for the Soviets, and they were unwilling to see that era end. They had been granted formal recognition of equality with the United States, had been able to expand their influence in the Third World, and, in the ABM treaty, had obtained a measure of restraint on the technological advantages of the Americans.

The idea had intrigued the president for years, and he was delighted when he found both scientists and military leaders who thought it feasible. Although those of his advisers who supported the plan saw it either as a bargaining chip to trade for Soviet arms reductions or as a limited antimissile defense to reduce the chance of a Soviet first strike, the president imagined a shield that would prevent any missiles from striking the United States.

Syria, supplied with Soviet arms, failed to contain the Israeli advance.8","['the year', 'June 1982']",principal defeat year come lebanon soviet fail gain blunder june 1982 israelis invade lebanon acquiescence secretary haig see israel surrogate soviet friend israeli determine eliminate sanctuary palestine liberation organization plo turn southern lebanon buffer zone shield israel arab attack syria supply soviet arm fail contain israeli advance.8,47,[1982],1982,1,2000,2000

Slowly the Americans were drawn into the civil strife as various Lebanese factions, Muslim and Christian, backed variously by Syria, Israel, and Iran, struggled to control the country.

1259,"SDI, the aftermath of the KAL 007 incident, the American use of force in Lebanon and against Grenada, the deployment of new missiles in Europe, all suggested to the Soviet leaders that a sharply increased level of confrontation was ahead for them and would continue as long as Reagan remained in the White House. The correlation of forces was shifting against them, and they prepared their people for a crisis. In fact, as Soviet apprehensions began to crystallize, George Shultz, who had replaced Haig as secretary of state in mid-1982, had already begun the process of moving the president toward a less apocalyptic vision of how to cope with his adversaries. More fortunate than Brezhnev, Andropov did catch a glimpse of a more hopeful relationship before he died in February 1984.","['mid-1982', 'February 1984']",sdi aftermath kal 007 incident use force lebanon grenada deployment new missile europe suggest soviet leader sharply increase level confrontation ahead continue long reagan remain white house correlation force shift prepare people crisis fact soviet apprehension begin crystallize george shultz replace haig secretary state mid-1982 begin process move president apocalyptic vision cope adversary fortunate brezhnev andropov catch glimpse hopeful relationship die february 1984,63,"[1982, 1984]",1983,2,2000,2000
1260,"Shultz discovered that Reagan was interested in traveling to China and the Soviet Union. He indicated to the president that an improvement in relations would have to antedate a visit to either nation. Reagan remarked that he was not unwilling to reduce tensions. Shultz arranged for the president to have a surprise talk with the Soviet ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin, in February 1983. Reagan demonstrated interest in a more constructive relationship. The Soviets responded by allowing a group of Pentecostal Christians who had taken refuge in the American Embassy in Moscow – and for whom Reagan had expressed concern – to leave the country in April. But distrust of Reagan was overwhelming in the Soviet leadership, and the remainder of the year provided little hope that he was changing. Still, Shultz pushed internally for conciliatory moves, arguing that the United States had recovered economically, was rebuilding militarily, and was in a strong position to negotiate. Shultz’s hand was strengthened by polling data revealing that foreign policy was Reagan’s one weak point with the electorate. In January 1984, Reagan made a relatively amiable speech about future Soviet-American relations and Shultz persuaded Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko that the president was in earnest. Andropov responded with a secret letter manifesting interest in developing communications between the two leaders.9","['February 1983', 'April', 'the year', 'January 1984']",shultz discover reagan interested travel china soviet union indicate president improvement relation antedate visit nation reagan remark unwilling reduce tension shultz arrange president surprise talk soviet ambassador anatoly dobrynin february 1983 reagan demonstrate interest constructive relationship soviet respond allow group pentecostal christian take refuge embassy moscow – reagan express concern – leave country april distrust reagan overwhelming soviet leadership remainder year provide little hope change shultz push internally conciliatory move argue united state recover economically rebuild militarily strong position negotiate shultz ’s hand strengthen poll datum reveal foreign policy reagan ’s weak point electorate january 1984 reagan relatively amiable speech future soviet relation shultz persuade soviet foreign minister andrei gromyko president earnest andropov respond secret letter manifest interest develop communication leaders.9,121,"[1983, 1984]",1984,2,2000,2000
1261,"The tensions that had developed in relations with China were partly a result of the inability of Reagan, prior to taking office, to understand that China had become a strategic asset to the United States. Chiang Kai-shek and “Free China” (i.e., the Republic of China on Taiwan) were important symbols to the American Right, and candidate Reagan had surrounded himself with men and women who saw Nixon’s rapprochement with the People’s Republic of China as a gross betrayal. Reagan talked of restoring recognition of the Taiwan regime, withdrawn when the Carter administration recognized Beijing in 1979. He frequently offered gratuitous remarks and gestures offensive to the government of Deng Xiaoping. Reagan’s behavior aggravated disagreements over the continued sale by the United States of weapons to the Taiwan regime. The advantages Nixon, Ford, and Carter had gained by drawing China closer to the United States in opposition to the Soviet Union were in danger of evaporating.10",['1979'],tension develop relation china partly result inability reagan prior take office understand china strategic asset united state chiang kai shek “ free china ” i.e. republic china taiwan important symbol right candidate reagan surround man woman see nixon ’s rapprochement people ’s republic china gross betrayal reagan talk restore recognition taiwan regime withdraw carter administration recognize beijing 1979 frequently offer gratuitous remark gesture offensive government deng xiaoping reagan ’s behavior aggravate disagreement continue sale united state weapon taiwan regime advantage nixon ford carter gain draw china closer united state opposition soviet union danger evaporating.10,94,[1979],1979,1,2000,2000

The Chinese continued to separate themselves from the United States and to be unsupportive in public forums like the United Nations. In August 1982, an agreement on arms sales to Taiwan merely papered over unresolved differences. Shultz never shared the Kissinger-Brzezinski estimate of China’s strategic importance, but he recognized the value of good relations, especially if tension could be reduced easily by muzzling the president. Gradually he brought Reagan to an understanding of the extent and value of Chinese-American collaboration, especially in gathering intelligence information about the Soviet Union. The president learned to swallow most of his notorious one-liners. In April 1984, Reagan visited China, his first foray into a Communist country. The Chinese greeted him with the extraordinary hospitality for which they are justly renowned, and they never had any trouble with him again. He enjoyed the trip and his reception enormously and came away with a more sanguine view of life in China than was probably justified. Trade and cultural relations prospered. The political relationship never regained the closeness of the late 1970s, but with the resurgence of American power it was not likely to be as important again.","['August 1982', 'April 1984', 'the late 1970s']",vice president george h. r. bush secretary state haig travel china reassure chinese leader interest cooperative relationship chinese continue separate united state unsupportive public forum like united nation august 1982 agreement arm sale taiwan merely paper unresolved difference shultz share kissinger brzezinski estimate china ’s strategic importance recognize value good relation especially tension reduce easily muzzle president gradually bring reagan understanding extent value chinese collaboration especially gather intelligence information soviet union president learn swallow notorious liner april 1984 reagan visit china foray communist country chinese greet extraordinary hospitality justly renowned trouble enjoy trip reception enormously come away sanguine view life china probably justified trade cultural relation prosper political relationship regain closeness late 1970 resurgence power likely important,117,"[1982, 1984, 1970]",1979,3,2000,2000

One American analyst estimated the Soviets were spending $40 billion annually on their friends abroad.11 Gorbachev and his advisers saw little economic, strategic, or ideological advantage deriving from the overseas commitments of the 1960s and 1970s. They were not only an extravagance, but they were also a major irritant in Soviet-American relations. Although some Soviet leaders still clung to the vision of their nation as the protector of socialist revolution against capitalist imperialism, Gorbachev was skeptical. He saw little potential for revolutionary change in the Third World.

Nor, as the Soviet leader’s plans unfolded, were Americans sure that it was in the interest of the United States to help him to build a modern, efficient Soviet economy, a stronger Soviet Union. The skeptics waited. In the interim, Reagan persisted in his efforts to roll back Soviet influence. Implementation of the Reagan Doctrine, American assistance to forces attempting to overthrow Communist or pro-Soviet regimes in the Third World, intensified. The CIA had gone to war against the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua in 1982, beginning with the training and equipping of “contras,” or, as the president preferred to describe them, “freedom fighters.” Nicaragua was the central front in the campaign, but American aid in various forms went to opponents of the Soviet-backed governments of Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, and untold other distant lands. When Congress tried to restrain the executive branch, the president’s aides raised money in the private sector and lobbied for financial support from wealthy friends abroad, such as the Saudis or the sultan of Brunei. Even the Israelis and ultimately the Iranians became involved as zealots in the National Security Council decided to sell arms secretly and illegally, with Israeli collusion, to the Iranians. The president’s aides used the proceeds to support the contras, thus subverting the intent of Congress and the Constitution of the United States.

Indeed, there had been several more shocking revelations of American CIA, FBI, and military personnel betraying their country to the Soviets in 1986. But a week after Zakharov’s arrest, Soviet authorities retaliated by framing Nicholas Daniloff, the highly respected Moscow correspondent of U.S. News and World Report.

As Gorbachev attempted to open Soviet society, to give a degree of legitimacy to pluralism, long smoldering separatist movements as well as interethnic violence erupted. The Baltic republics – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – comprised a special problem. They had enjoyed independence between World Wars I and II but were occupied and then annexed by Stalin as part of the agreement with Hitler in 1939, the notorious Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact. By 1989, discussion of the pact was no longer forbidden and the Soviet government admitted its culpability – or rather Stalin’s. The obvious next step was for the Baltic peoples to denounce the pact and demand their independence. Here Gorbachev drew the line: If the Baltic republics were allowed to claim their independence, how could Ukraine, Georgia, or any of the other republics with strong separatist movements be denied?

1282,"For Gorbachev, the end of the Cold War brought a well-deserved Nobel Peace Prize, but the great statesman won little honor at home. Neither his diplomatic exploits nor his perestroika put food on the plates of his people, or did anything to alleviate the miserable economic conditions of the Soviet people. Buffeted from the right and the left, he sailed first one way and then the other, in a desperate and ultimately unsuccessful effort to ride out the storm. In August 1991, he was deposed in a coup led by conservatives and held prisoner in the Crimea. A few days later, the coup leaders found the military unwilling to crush a few thousand demonstrators who had rallied around Boris Yeltsin, a onetime Gorbachev supporter who had come to personify the demand for more radical change. Gorbachev returned to Moscow, but events had passed him by. Communism, however reformist, was finished in the Soviet Union. Indeed, the Soviet Union was finished. The Baltic states immediately declared and achieved their independence, without resistance from Moscow. One after another, the constituent republics declared their independence, the Communist party was outlawed, and Gorbachev had no empire, no country, and then no government to rule. Before the year was out, Boris Yeltsin, popularly elected president of the Russian Republic, moved into the Kremlin and Gorbachev was forced into early retirement. On December 31, 1991, the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist, succeeded by a loosely organized Commonwealth of Independent States.22","['August 1991', 'A few days later', 'the year', 'December 31, 1991']",gorbachev end cold war bring deserve nobel peace prize great statesman win little honor home diplomatic exploit perestroika food plate people alleviate miserable economic condition soviet people buffet right left sail way desperate ultimately unsuccessful effort ride storm august 1991 depose coup lead conservative hold prisoner crimea day later coup leader find military unwilling crush thousand demonstrator rally boris yeltsin onetime gorbachev supporter come personify demand radical change gorbachev return moscow event pass communism reformist finish soviet union soviet union finish baltic state immediately declare achieve independence resistance moscow constituent republic declare independence communist party outlaw gorbachev empire country government rule year boris yeltsin popularly elect president russian republic move kremlin gorbachev force early retirement december 31 1991 soviet union officially cease exist succeed loosely organize commonwealth independent states.22,129,"[1991, 1991]",1991,2,2000,2000
1283,"The United States of America was the only superpower to survive the Cold War. It had triumphed economically, ideologically, and politically. It had been spared the ultimate military test of a direct confrontation, probably nuclear, with its principal adversary. Curiously, few Americans stopped to celebrate. They found, in fact, that the quality of their lives was declining rather than improving. Their economy, the envy of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the Third World, was a mess. They were confronted with an industrial infrastructure and transportation system in decay, a corrupt banking system that had cost thousands of people their life’s savings, massive unemployment, and widespread homelessness. The Reagan administration, in its effort to expand American military power without asking the American people to pay for it, had run up an incredible deficit, leaving the government without the means to respond to the economic crisis at home or the needs of its less fortunate constituents. Once the nation upon which the world depended for investment capital, the world’s leading lender, it had become in 1985 the world’s leading debtor, dependent on Japan, Germany, and Arab oil-producing states. It had to solicit donations from foreign governments to finance the war against Iraq in 1991. It could no longer provide sufficient aid to needy countries abroad or necessary services for its own people. Voter apathy eroded the value of its electoral system.

The central thread in the tapestry of the international politics of the time was the Soviet-American confrontation. In 1945, the Soviet Union and the United States, allied in the war against the Axis powers, crushed their enemies and emerged from the war triumphant, each with only the other remaining as a credible adversary.

1285,"Ideologically, anticommunism was the engine that drove American action, just as hostility to what they perceived as capitalist imperialism energized Soviet leaders, few of whom still dreamed of a socialist Utopia. As Soviet power grew in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, so did American fears of communism. With the opening of Soviet society in the late 1980s, even ideologues like Reagan were prepared to cooperate with the former “evil empire.” With the collapse of the Soviet state in 1991, American leaders lost their compass and sailed, bewildered, in search of a new heading. What remained of the Soviet hierarchy, in Russia and other former Soviet republics, had a surer sense of what it sought: the course to capitalist development.

The answer has three parts, found by pursuing three intersecting lines of inquiry. First, there was the determination of American leaders to accept what they saw as the responsibilities of power, to lead the world, to create a new world order. Second was the qualities of the two states – the excesses of civil society in one (the powerful-state, weak-government pattern in the United States) and the absence of it in the other (the all-powerful Stalinist government).

Had the United States chosen to pursue a version of the “continentalism” advocated by some intellectuals in the 1930s or the autarky advocated by others in the 1960s, the dynamics of the postwar world would have been very different. But a generation of American leaders had concluded that it was American shirking of responsibility after World War I that had allowed for the temporary ascendency of Adolf Hitler and the Japanese militarists, for the Great Depression, and for World War II. Conscious of Santayana’s dictum about those who forget the past being doomed to repeat it, they learned the lessons of the historians and began to apply them in the mid-1940s.","['the 1930s', 'the 1960s', 'the mid-1940s']",determination provide world leadership difficult conceive cold war united state choose pursue version “ continentalism ” advocate intellectual 1930 autarky advocate 1960 dynamic postwar world different generation leader conclude shirking responsibility world war allow temporary ascendency adolf hitler japanese militarist great depression world war ii conscious santayana ’s dictum forget past doom repeat learn lesson historian begin apply mid-1940,59,"[1930, 1960, 1940]",1943,3,1950,1950
1288,"The Bretton Woods agreements are also useful as an illustration of the strong-state, weak-government notion. They were designed by the men who controlled the apparatus of government in 1944 not only to serve American interests abroad but also to preempt special-interest groups of the sort that often prevent the leadership from pursuing its conception of the national interest. The executive branch of the government in 1944 was committing the United States to a particular economic regime before the opposition (primarily protectionist and functioning primarily through Congress) could act. In wartime, the executive tends to have much greater leeway to impose its will, and students of contemporary American affairs will note how often the executive attempts to simulate wartime conditions to claim powers it could not otherwise exercise.","['1944', '1944']",bretton wood agreement useful illustration strong state weak government notion design man control apparatus government 1944 serve interest abroad preempt special interest group sort prevent leadership pursue conception national interest executive branch government 1944 commit united state particular economic regime opposition primarily protectionist function primarily congress act wartime executive tend great leeway impose student contemporary affair note executive attempt simulate wartime condition claim power exercise,65,"[1944, 1944]",1944,2,1950,1950
1289,"The issue of the Soviet sphere in Eastern Europe provides another illustration of how the structure of the American government placed restraints on even a strong president and, equally important, how the brutality of the Stalinist system precluded an acceptable solution. Roosevelt had no problem resolving the matter of conflict between the Polish right to self-determination and the Soviet right to security in favor of the Soviets. The Poles had done little to commend themselves in the 1930s. They had flirted with Hitler, persecuted Jews, and seized a part of Czechoslovakia after Munich. Soviet power was essential to victory over the Nazis and would be essential for maintaining world peace after the war. But because of the nature of the American political system, Roosevelt needed some help from Stalin. He needed Soviet gestures toward the cherished principle of self-determination, and he needed to have Soviet influence in Eastern Europe generally and in Poland in particular to be exercised magnanimously (as the Americans would exercise theirs in Germany, Italy, and Japan, which were, after all, defeated enemies).

1290,"At the end of the war, Soviet suspicion of American intentions, combined with awareness of superior American power and the memory of Western hostility to the existence of the Soviet state, drove Stalin and his colleagues to take steps to enhance their security. These steps aroused apprehension in Washington in 1946, as the security dilemma – the notion that an increase in one state’s security automatically decreases that of another – began to affect strategic thinking. Initially divided in their estimates of Soviet intentions, American leaders, troubled by Soviet behavior, reached a consensus on the need for policies to demonstrate the nation’s will to protect its interests. These policies were perceived as threatening by the men in the Kremlin. Although each state conceived of its own actions as defensive, each was alarmed increasingly by the maneuvers of the other. Every wary step triggered a response that heightened the sense of menace felt in both capitals.","['1946', 'another –']",end war soviet suspicion intention combine awareness superior power memory western hostility existence soviet state drive stalin colleague step enhance security step arouse apprehension washington 1946 security dilemma – notion increase state ’s security automatically decrease – begin affect strategic thinking initially divide estimate soviet intention leader trouble soviet behavior reach consensus need policy demonstrate nation ’s protect interest policy perceive threaten man kremlin state conceive action defensive alarm increasingly maneuver wary step trigger response heighten sense menace feel capital,80,[1946],1946,1,1950,1950

They saw the disinclination of Congress and the American people to concern themselves with world affairs, the desire to demobilize and consume, as the principal obstacles to assuming the responsibility of world leadership – a conflict between the perceptions of the international relations elite and popular pressures (again the strong-state, weak-government paradox). They also warned of the unexpected difficulty of Europe with postwar recovery.

1292,"This, of course, is the context for the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. In the weak-government paradigm, the president’s authority is contested constantly by Congress, especially when the two branches of government are controlled by different parties. Certainly this tension is what the framers of the American Constitution intended as a check on executive power. In practice, Congress members who have been elected on the basis of issues peculiar to their home districts respond more readily to the demands of domestic special-interest groups than to the imperatives of foreign policy. To focus congressional attention on foreign affairs and attain their objectives, presidents and their retainers may contrive an international crisis. Often in domestic affairs, almost always in foreign affairs, a sense of crisis will result in legislative deference to the president, to an enhancement of executive power, to an imperial presidency.

Stalin was trying to prevent the creation of a German state capable of challenging Soviet dominance in Eastern and Central Europe, of reversing Soviet gains since 1945. This confrontation was unlike earlier disagreements between the Soviet Union and the United States. American action was not merely irritating; it was fraught with danger. Stalin consequently risked more in trying to deflect the Americans from their course.

Bush, who had served as liaison officer in Beijing 1974–5, kept policy toward the People’s Republic in his own hands. He considered China to be an important strategic partner of the United States, and he and Scowcroft were determined not to allow the massacres that occurred there to disrupt the relationship. Forced by public outrage to impose sanctions on China, he nonetheless sent Scowcroft on a secret mission to assure Deng of Washington’s continued friendship – an assurance belied by the necessity of keeping the mission secret and by the outrage that exploded when word of it leaked out months later. Presumably, Bush and his advisers, not wholly persuaded of Gorbachev’s good intentions, discerned a continuing need to avoid antagonizing the men in Beijing. The atrocities perpetrated by the People’s Liberation Army in the vicinity of Tiananmen Square – and elsewhere in China – occurred, after all, several months before Eastern Europeans liberated themselves, before the Berlin Wall came down.

Unfortunately it could not be disposed of as readily as Noriega’s regime or as easily as the Eisenhower administration helped dispose of an earlier Iranian government in 1954. Washington settled for efforts to contain its influence, and the Reagan administration did not hesitate to assist the vicious Soviet-backed Iraqi dictatorship of Saddam Hussein when it engaged in a long war with Iran in the 1980s. But when that war ended in 1988, Saddam’s actions became increasingly irritating. His rhetorical belligerence toward Israel and Kuwait worried the National Security Council, but in 1989 the president was preoccupied with the Baltic challenge to Gorbachev and that issue’s potential to disrupt Soviet-American relations.","['1979', '1954', 'the 1980s', '1988', '1989']",hostage crisis tehran 1979 united state openly hostile iranian government unfortunately dispose readily noriega ’s regime easily eisenhower administration help dispose early iranian government 1954 washington settle effort contain influence reagan administration hesitate assist vicious soviet back iraqi dictatorship saddam hussein engage long war iran 1980s war end 1988 saddam ’s action increasingly irritating rhetorical belligerence israel kuwait worry national security council 1989 president preoccupy baltic challenge gorbachev issue ’s potential disrupt soviet relation,74,"[1979, 1954, 1980, 1988, 1989]",1978,5,2000,2000

Assuming Saddam was bluffing, the United States did not indicate to Baghdad what action it might take if the Iraqis actually invaded Kuwait. When the invasion came, Bush was shocked and determined not to allow this act of aggression to go unpunished. If there was to be a new and peaceful world order with the end of the Cold War, Iraq would have to be stopped. Increasingly, the president equated Saddam with Hitler, the invasion with unchecked German and Japanese actions in the 1930s. If Saddam were allowed to succeed in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia likely would be next – and then he would seek dominance over the entire Arab world and its oil. Bush prepared for a crusade against evil and to preserve the flow of oil. Many Americans, however, including Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, saw no compelling reason for the United States to ride to the rescue. Some thought sanctions would suffice to bring about an Iraqi pull-back.

The overthrow of democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti in September 1991 was further evidence that the administration would do little to further the vision of Fukuyama and Wolfowitz. Although Baker conceded the United States had an interest in the restoration of democracy in Haiti, he argued it was not a vital interest. Force was not justified. To be sure, the administration went through the motions of condemning the coup and persuading the Organization of American States (OAS) to impose a trade embargo, but it preferred the maintenance of the military junta to the restoration of Aristide, viewed by many conservatives as a dangerous radical. It did nothing to facilitate his return. Perhaps more embarrassing for the moral standing of the United States, it forcibly returned Haitians who sought refuge on America’s shores – or interned them at Guantanamo.","['September 1991', '–']",democracy go spread little likelihood united state serve handmaiden overthrow democratically elect president jean bertrand aristide haiti september 1991 evidence administration little vision fukuyama wolfowitz baker concede united state interest restoration democracy haiti argue vital interest force justify sure administration go motion condemn coup persuade organization state oas impose trade embargo prefer maintenance military junta restoration aristide view conservative dangerous radical facilitate return embarrassing moral standing united state forcibly return haitian seek refuge america ’s shore – intern guantanamo,79,[1991],1991,1,2000,2000

By the spring of 1991, it was evident that Croatia and Slovenia, two of the six republics of the federation, were preparing to secede, encouraged by Germany. It was equally clear that Serbia, driven by the demagoguery of its leader, Slobodan Milosevic, would attack both republics if they declared independence. In June, Baker made a perfunctory trip to Belgrade, advised the Croat and Slovene leaders against independence, and chastised Milosevic for human rights abuses, specifically against Kosovars of Albanian ethnicity. Baker expressed the hope they could resolve their differences peacefully and left, fully expecting to be ignored.

In the late 1990s, however, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) emerged as the dominant force in the Muslim community, and it attacked Serb police and vandalized Orthodox churches and cemeteries, deliberately provoking Milosevic.

She staged a conference in France at which the KLA was forced to agree to disarm if the Serbs would withdraw most of their forces from Kosovo, restore a degree of autonomy, and accept NATO peacekeepers.

Efforts to continue Gorbachev’s reforms accelerated under the leadership of the mercurial Boris Yeltsin, with whom Clinton met in April 1993 to underscore his support. But Yeltsin faced opposition at home, where many people were being hurt by the changes being implemented. The Russian parliament, the Duma, proved recalcitrant, and when Yeltsin tired of legislative restrictions on his power, of hostile and violent street demonstrations organized by his enemies, he sent in tanks to fire on the parliamentary building, which the offending legislators were using as their headquarters – an action that might have been considered undemocratic and excessive.16","['April 1993', '–']",largely strobe talbott ’s influence clinton focus frequently relation russia effort continue gorbachev ’s reform accelerate leadership mercurial boris yeltsin clinton meet april 1993 underscore support yeltsin face opposition home people hurt change implement russian parliament duma prove recalcitrant yeltsin tired legislative restriction power hostile violent street demonstration organize enemy send tank fire parliamentary building offend legislator headquarter – action consider undemocratic excessive.16,63,[1993],1993,1,2000,2000

Some, Albright and Holbrooke most prominent among them, advocated expansion of NATO to protect the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe from a resurgent Russia; others, to prevent a united Germany from dominating Europe again. For Clinton there were potential domestic political advantages to NATO expansion: bipartisan support for the idea in Congress and the votes of Americans of Czech, Hungarian, Polish, and Slovak ancestry.","['the 1990s –', '–']",critical question official public intellectual 1990s – – nato organization view means contain german soviet power cold war albright holbrooke prominent advocate expansion nato protect new democracy central eastern europe resurgent russia prevent united germany dominate europe clinton potential domestic political advantage nato expansion bipartisan support idea congress vote american czech hungarian polish slovak ancestry,55,[1990],1990,1,2000,2000

Yeltsin denounced the Partnership for Peace and the expansion of NATO as a threat to Russia and warned that a “cold peace” was descending upon Europe. Yeltsin’s supporters had been defeated badly in the parliamentary elections of December 1993, and his political advisers argued that NATO expansion was angering the Russian people. There were indications that even those most supportive of the new Russian-American relationship perceived the United States as taking advantage of Russia’s weakness. Defense specialists in the Duma worried also about American plans for national missile defense and demanded revision of the START II arms limitation agreement.

Long hostile toward Russians, not least because Stalin had deported them during World War II, Chechens sought greater autonomy after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Their provocations in 1994 were met by an invasion of Russian troops and bombing of Chechen cities.

It was also apparent that Russian troops were poorly trained and led and were behaving brutally toward people who were still Russian citizens. Atrocities against civilians mounted, as did the casualty rate among the invaders. Anxiety grew in Washington and in the capitals of former Warsaw Pact nations – although Helmut Kohl was the first to condemn Russian actions. Clinton flew to Moscow in May 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the German surrender that ended World War II in Europe. He complained to Yeltsin about the human rights violations in Chechnya of which the Russian army was accused. Yeltsin was unresponsive on that issue but agreed to sign the Partners for Peace agreement. Clinton did not come home empty-handed, but the war in Chechnya went on until opposition to the casualties among their children fighting there led the Russian people to demand an end.

But pandering to the electorate did not spare Yeltsin’s followers, who were routed by Communists and extreme nationalists in the parliamentary elections of 1995. Polling in the single digits, Yeltsin faced a grim future, but Clinton’s advisers, fearing a return to power of the Communist Party, could muster no alternative to backing him.

Trying desperately to retain his grip on power, Yeltsin fired his prime minister in August 1999 and replaced him with Vladimir Putin, an unknown former KGB agent. Putin quickly indicated he had little interest in political democracy. He demonstrated distaste for opposition politicians and a free press. He resumed forceful, brutal military action against Chechnya. And the Russian public responded favorably. Putin appealed to Russian nationalism and pride, and the people were willing to tolerate the deterioration of their newfound freedoms in exchange for an increase in their sense of security. Four months later, Yeltsin astonished the world by stepping aside and anointing Putin as his successor.

The Chinese turned to European suppliers, and representatives of the affected American companies, including major donors to Clinton’s political campaigns, demanded waivers.

Insisting that Saddam had to be overthrown, he persuaded a Republican-controlled Congress to give $97 million to the Iraqi opposition, which, presumably with American air support, would overthrow Saddam.

He warned that these three were seeking weapons of mass destruction that they might make available to terrorists. The United States was determined to prevent that from happening. At West Point a few months later, the president declared his intent to take preemptive action if necessary to prevent another terrorist attack. He told his audience that the world’s most powerful nation intended to remain the world’s most powerful nation in perpetuity, acting as necessary to stifle any challenge.2","['January 2002', 'a few months later']",bush ’s state union address congress january 2002 redirect country ’s focus war terror al qaeda need regime change rogue state specifically iraq iran north korea warn seek weapon mass destruction available terrorist united state determine prevent happen west point month later president declare intent preemptive action necessary prevent terrorist attack tell audience world ’s powerful nation intend remain world ’s powerful nation perpetuity act necessary stifle challenge.2,68,[2002],2002,1,2025,2050

Tehran shared American hostility toward the Taliban and was at least as eager as Washington to crush Saddam Hussein. When al Qaeda struck the United States on 9/11, Iranian leaders condemned the attacks. Iran seized several al Qaeda operatives and facilitated American-led operations in Afghanistan.

North Korea had an enormous army and countless missile launchers within range of Seoul. If attacked it could devastate South Korea. It could strike Japan and, conceivably, even the United States. Cheney and Rumsfeld, deeply engaged in planning the invasion of Iraq, acquiesced to a limited diplomatic effort to persuade Pyongyang to back down. When that failed, Bush signaled a major policy shift. In January 2003, on the eve of war with Iraq, he declared that the U.S. had no intention of attacking North Korea and would consider offering economic assistance and a security agreement if Pyongyang would dismantle its nuclear program. The Americans were even willing to talk to the North Koreans, as urged by Seoul and Tokyo. Critics accused the Bush team of adopting a Clintonesque policy of doing nothing and hoping Kim’s evil regime would fade away.

Whatever progress had been made in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during the closing days of the Clinton administration vanished with the election of Ariel Sharon as Israeli premier in February 2001. No Israeli was feared and hated more by the Palestinians. No Israeli was perceived as more hostile to their aspirations, more ruthless in his determination to crush them. Terrorist attacks against Israel increased. Neither Sharon nor Arafat seemed interested in working toward a peaceful settlement.

All of Bush’s advisers understood that the Israeli-Palestinian struggle was an essential part of the politics of the Middle East, but were uncertain as to how to proceed. Instinctively, Bush sympathized with the Israelis, equating terrorist attacks on Israel with terrorist attacks on the United States. Israeli fears that 9/11 would undermine American support proved unfounded. Although Bush appealed to Arab opinion by becoming the first American president to support explicitly the creation of a Palestinian state, the U.S.-Israeli relationship grew stronger. Despite the ruthlessness with which Sharon responded to terrorist atrocities, Bush labeled him a man of peace.6",['September 2001'],al qaeda attack united state september 2001 force administration reconsider bush ’s adviser understand israeli palestinian struggle essential politic middle east uncertain proceed instinctively bush sympathize israelis equate terrorist attack israel terrorist attack united state israeli fear 9/11 undermine support prove unfounded bush appeal arab opinion president support explicitly creation palestinian state u.s .- israeli relationship grow strong despite ruthlessness sharon respond terrorist atrocity bush label man peace.6,68,[2001],2001,1,2025,2050

Both Arafat and Sharon knew Powell had no authority to put pressure on the Israelis – certainly not in an election year in the United States, when there was much to be lost by appearing to be anti-Israel. Moreover, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz insisted that Sharon’s crackdown on the Palestinians was a legitimate response to terrorism. The administration failed to restart the peace process, confirming the majority view on Bush’s foreign policy team that it was a hopeless cause. Bush abandoned Powell’s attempt at being evenhanded and announced the United States would not support statehood for the Palestinians until they had a new and democratic leadership.

In November the UN Security Council unanimously demanded that Iraq surrender all weapons of mass destruction – without authorizing the use of force if Saddam failed to comply. Bush, however, concluded that the UN resolution gave legitimacy to the invasion of Iraq the Pentagon was planning. On January 11, 2003, Rumsfeld told the Saudi ambassador that war was certain.

In the south, the power vacuum was filled by militia forces commanded by Shiite religious figures, eager to lead the country as soon as coalition forces left. But in Baghdad and central Iraq, in the “Sunni Triangle,” forces hostile to the United States, including some affiliated with al Qaeda, generated massive unrest.

As Iraqi leaders of all persuasions perceived the Americans eager to go home, the fighting on the ground became more a struggle for power among Iraqis than an anti-American insurgency. Indeed, there were indications that some Sunnis were prepared to turn against the insurgents if assured of a long-term American presence as a hedge against Shiite domination.

It was outnumbered and outgunned by warlord forces and constantly under attack by Taliban raiders, with both groups financing their forces by expanding the drug trade.

Iraq appeared relatively stable, but with little prospect of becoming the peaceful democracy Americans yearned to leave behind.

Approximately 45,000 armed men and women remained to provide training for the Iraqi army and a degree of security. A reasonably democratic election to the national legislature, held in January 2010, resulted in a near tie between the two leading parties and their allies – and a stalemate that persisted for months before the selection of a prime minister. Violence persisted, usually Shia attacks on Sunnis and vice versa, but with occasional fraternal warfare among Shiite factions and with al Qaeda – echoes of the past. But American attention had shifted elsewhere.

1454,"“Elsewhere” was primarily to the domestic economy as the country was wracked with massive unemployment amid a painfully slow and uncertain recovery. But Clinton, Gates, and their colleagues remained focused on Obama’s foreign policy agenda, headed by the war in Afghanistan, which had become “Obama’s war.” American troop levels in the country increased, efforts to win the support of the Afghan people intensified, but the resurgence of the Taliban continued. Dissatisfaction with Karzai’s corrupt government and his outrageous manipulation of the results of the 2009 election soared, as did tensions between Karzai and the American diplomats who tried to work with him – including the redoubtable Richard Holbrooke. In 2010, the highly respected General David Petraeus, who had overseen the surge in Iraq, took command of NATO forces in Afghanistan, allowing a modicum of hope for a minimally acceptable outcome in the foreseeable future. Support for the effort was eroding in the United States as well as among NATO allies, which began to withdraw their troops. American troop reductions, well under way in Iraq, would begin in Afghanistan before the next presidential election. Pakistani intelligence forces (ISI) continued to play a double game, providing some assistance to the NATO effort – and protecting Afghan Taliban leaders, whom they saw as a strategic asset against India. Indeed, when Osama bin Laden was finally found in 2011 – and killed by U.S. Navy SEALs – he was living comfortably in a Pakistani military garrison town. Suspicion pervaded the ranks of American officials and foreign affairs observers that the ISI was complicit in sheltering him there.","['2009', '2010', '–', '2011 –']",“ ” primarily domestic economy country wrack massive unemployment amid painfully slow uncertain recovery clinton gate colleague remain focused obama ’s foreign policy agenda head war afghanistan “ obama ’s war troop level country increase effort win support afghan people intensify resurgence taliban continue dissatisfaction karzai ’s corrupt government outrageous manipulation result 2009 election soar tension karzai diplomat try work – include redoubtable richard holbrooke 2010 highly respected general david petraeus oversee surge iraq take command nato force afghanistan allow modicum hope minimally acceptable outcome foreseeable future support effort erode united state nato ally begin withdraw troop troop reduction way iraq begin afghanistan presidential election pakistani intelligence force isi continue play double game provide assistance nato effort – protect afghan taliban leader see strategic asset india osama bin laden finally find 2011 – kill u.s navy seal – live comfortably pakistani military garrison town suspicion pervade rank official foreign affair observer isi complicit shelter,154,"[2009, 2010, 2011]",2010,3,2025,2050
1455,"Many analysts argued that ending the Israeli-Palestinian standoff constituted the key to peace in the Middle East. Muslims throughout the world often pointed to U.S. support of Israel as the source of their anti-Americanism. The Obama administration committed itself to bringing the two sides together, appointing George Mitchell, who had brokered peace in Northern Ireland for the Clinton administration, to the lead role. Unfortunately, Hamas, controlling Gaza, demonstrated no interest, and the Palestinian authority on the West Bank was too weak to make peace with Israel without concessions that the right-wing Likud government of Israel would not grant. Pressure on Israel to stop building settlements on Palestinian land gained little for the United States – and convinced most Israelis that Obama was hostile to them. In 2010, Washington pushed the Palestinians into new direct talks with Israel that failed to achieve any progress. Mitchell resigned in frustration, and in 2011 Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, confident of support among the American people and their representatives in Congress, was openly dismissive of Obama’s efforts.","['2010', '2011']",analyst argue end israeli palestinian standoff constitute key peace middle east muslim world point u.s support israel source anti americanism obama administration commit bring side appoint george mitchell broker peace northern ireland clinton administration lead role unfortunately hamas control gaza demonstrate interest palestinian authority west bank weak peace israel concession right wing likud government israel grant pressure israel stop build settlement palestinian land gain little united state – convince israelis obama hostile 2010 washington push palestinian new direct talk israel fail achieve progress mitchell resign frustration 2011 israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu confident support people representative congress openly dismissive obama ’s effort,102,"[2010, 2011]",2010,2,2025,2050

Quickly the movement spread throughout the region to Egypt, Bahrain, Yemen, Libya, and Syria. Washington’s Egyptian ally, Hosni Mubarak, found himself under intense pressure to resign. In Bahrain, headquarters of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, the ruling class was threatened, and in Yemen, where the unpopular president claimed to be assisting the United States against al Qaeda, protestors filled the streets. Hesitantly, Obama moved to support the demonstrators, uncertain as to who they were and how their success would affect American interests in the region. Washington advised Mubarak to step aside: Eventually he did. The Bahrain authorities were asked to refrain from violence: They did not.

Anticipating reciprocity from the Chinese, they were profoundly disappointed. As the Chinese economy quickly recovered from the recession while the American economy continued to founder, Chinese arrogance became increasingly blatant. The United States, they posited, was in decline. It was acting from weakness. By contrast, China’s rapid rise demonstrated that its form of government, its economic management, would provide a superior model for the future. Beijing yielded little on any of the issues that divided it from Washington and became increasingly bellicose in its warnings to the United States on Taiwan and in its expansion of its “core” interests in East Asia. Analysts at the Pentagon worried about the rapid modernization and strengthening of the Chinese military and the threat it posed to American interests in the western Pacific. But the military power of the United States was likely to be sufficient to deter a confrontation for decades to come, and the relative calm in the Taiwan Strait appeared to defuse a dangerous situation. Nonetheless, in 2012, the Obama administration announced that it was strengthening its defensive position across the Pacific, “pivoting” (presumably from the Middle East) toward East Asia.

Obama saw Iran’s activities as undermining his commitment to nonproliferation and unsettling the entire Middle East. Israel, in the face of Iranian denials of the Holocaust and promises to destroy the Jewish state, perceived a threat to its very existence.
